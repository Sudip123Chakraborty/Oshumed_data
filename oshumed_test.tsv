0,"Grading white matter lesions on CT and MRI: a simple scale.
 We developed and tested a simple three-point scale for grading white matter lesions in anterior and posterior regions of the brain.
 Twenty four CT scans and 24 MRI scans were separately judged by 11 and five observers, respectively, on the presence and severity of white matter lesions.
 The observers were radiologists and neurologists.
 For CT scans, these periventricular changes were graded according to their extent as absent, or partly involving the white matter, or extending up to the subcortical region.
 The MRI lesions were graded as no lesion or only a single one, multiple focal lesions, and multiple confluent lesions.
 The pairwise agreements of all possible combinations of observers for each scan were corrected for chance (kappa statistics; maximal agreement 1.0).
 The weighted kappa value, for anterior and posterior regions combined, was 0.63 for CT scans, and 0.78 for MRI scans.
 This three-point scale for two separate regions seems suitable as a basis for cross-sectional or longitudinal studies of large series of patients.

1,"Florid refractory schizophrenias that turn out to be treatable variants of HLA-associated narcolepsy.
 Narcolepsy in which the hallucinatory component is unusually prominent may lead to the development of an illness indistinguishable from the schizophrenic syndrome.
 Psychotic symptoms dominate the symptomatology, so that the primary illness is obscured.
 Five patients are described for whom conventional antipsychotic drugs were ineffectual, but for whom treatment with stimulants produced substantial improvement.
 The diagnosis of narcolepsy was confirmed by Human Leukocyte Antigen typing and sleep laboratory testing.
 These results support the ""REM intrusion"" hypothesis of the causation of schizophrenia in as many as 7% of a series of schizophrenic patients.
 Implications for diagnosis and treatment are discussed.

2,"Neurophysiological observations on corticospinal projections to the upper limb in subjects with Rett syndrome.
 The aim of the present study was to investigate the excitability of corticospinal neurons and the integrity of their projections to the alpha motor neurons through the corticospinal tract in subjects of different ages with Rett syndrome.
 Electromagnetic stimulation of the motor cortex and cervical motor roots was used to evoke motor action potentials in the biceps brachii and hypothenar muscles.
 The phasic stretch reflex in the biceps brachii was also recorded to study the excitability of spinal alpha motor neurons.
 Motor cortex stimulation evoked motor action potentials at low threshold and with abnormally short latencies and prolonged durations.
 In contrast cervical motor root stimulation resulted in responses of normal latency and duration.
 The phasic stretch reflex had a low threshold, short latency and prolonged duration.
 It is concluded that in Rett syndrome the corticospinal pathway is intact.
 The results suggest disordered synaptic control of the Betz cell of the motor cortex and/or the spinal alpha motor neuron, although the involvement of the latter might be a consequence of dysfunction in supraspinal descending motor pathways.

3,"The role of tumor-derived cytokines on the immune system of mice bearing a mammary adenocarcinoma. I. Induction of regulatory macrophages in normal mice by the in vivo administration of rGM-CSF.
 Using a dimethylbenzanthracene-induced immunogenic nonmetastatic murine mammary adenocarcinoma in BALB/c mice, our previous work has shown that splenocytes from tumor bearers have reduced responses to both mitogens and Ag including tumor-associated Ag.
 NK and cytotoxic T cell activities are also reduced in splenocytes of tumor bearers.
 Mac-1+2+ macrophages induced in mammary tumor bearers are capable of down-regulating lymphocyte responses to mitogens and tumor-associated Ag by cell to cell contact interaction and increased PGE2 production.
 We have found that the tumor constitutively releases a granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF-like factor in vivo and in vitro, which may be responsible for the systemic increase in cells of the macrophage lineage in tumor-bearing mice.
 A tumor cell line established from the in vivo tumor expresses and releases GM-CSF as shown by Northern and Western blot analyses.
 Daily i.p.
 injections for 3 wk of 10,000 U of rGM-CSF into normal mice induces hemopoietic and immunologic alterations similar to those observed in tumor bearers.
 Mac-1+ and/or Mac-2+ macrophages can also be detected in the spleens and bone marrow of the mice treated with rGM-CSF.
 Additionally, splenocytes from rGM-CSF-treated mice have reduced responses to mitogens and their peritoneal exudate cells can cause in vitro down-regulation of proliferative responses of lymphocytes from normal mice.
 The suppression can be partially reversed by the addition of indomethacin to the cultures suggesting that PGE2 may contribute to the effect.
 rGM-CSF enhances the in vitro release of PGE2 by the spleen, bone marrow, and peritoneal cells of normal mice.
 These data indicate that the high levels of GM-CSF constitutively produced by the tumor may be responsible for the hemopoietic changes and immunologic alterations observed in tumor-bearing mice.

4,"Factors associated with alcohol use in later adolescence.
 The relative influence of a number of family and individual characteristics on the frequency and intensity of alcohol use in a group of older adolescents was assessed.
 The sample consisted of 8,661 persons ranging in age from 20 to 21 years obtained from the ""High School and Beyond"" study.
 Logistic regression analyses performed on both frequency and intensity of alcohol use indicated that white males from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, living in urban or suburban areas and having an external locus of control and a weak family orientation, tended to drink more frequently and consume a larger quantity of alcohol per drinking episode.
 Results are explained from a sociocultural perspective.

5,"Predictors of cardiac survival after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction.
 To assess the outcome of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and to determine the predictors of mortality, 73 patients with LV ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% who underwent initial PTCA were analyzed.
 The majority of patients had prior (greater than 1 week) myocardial infarction (62 patients, 85%).
 Congestive heart failure and unstable angina were present in 24 (45%) and 49 (67%) patients, respectively.
 Multivessel coronary artery disease was present in 60 (83%).
 The LV ejection fraction ranged from 14 to 40% (mean 34%).
 Intraaortic balloon pump (15%) and percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support (4%) was used infrequently.
 Angiographic success was obtained in 109 of 128 lesions (85%) attempted.
 Complete revascularization was obtained in 16 of 60 patients with clinical success.
 Procedure-related mortality was 5% (4 patients).
 All patients were followed from greater than or equal to 6 to less than or equal to 71 months (average 26).
 The estimated survival was 79 +/- 5%, 74 +/- 6%, 66 +/- 7% and 57 +/- 8% at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively.
 A Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of congestive heart failure, a lower LV ejection fraction and a higher myocardial jeopardy score for contractile myocardium were independent predictors of survival after PTCA in patients with LV dysfunction.
 In conclusion, a high-risk subset can be identified among patients with severe LV dysfunction who undergo PTCA.

6,"The effect of muscle-sparing versus standard posterolateral thoracotomy on pulmonary function, muscle strength, and postoperative pain.
 Increased interest in alternative approaches to thoracotomy has developed because of the considerable morbidity associated with the standard posterolateral technique.
 We conducted a prospective, randomized, blinded study of 50 consecutive patients to compare postoperative pain, pulmonary function, shoulder strength, and range of shoulder motion between the standard posterolateral and the muscle sparing thoracotomy techniques.
 Pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity), shoulder strength, and range of motion were measured preoperatively and at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively.
 Pain was quantitated by postoperative narcotic requirements, the visual analogue scale, and the McGill pain questionnaire.
 Morbidity, mortality, and hospital stay were compared between the standard posterolateral and muscle-sparing techniques.
 There were no differences in postoperative pulmonary function, shoulder range of motion, extent of lung resection, surgical approach time, mortality, or hospital stay.
 There was significantly less postoperative pain in the muscle-sparing group.
 The narcotic requirement was less in the first 24 hours (p = 0.0169), and visual analogue scale scores were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) throughout the first postoperative week.
 Shoulder girdle strength was decreased at 1 week in the standard incision group whereas the strength was preserved with the muscle-sparing approach.
 Muscle strength had returned to preoperative levels by 1 month in both groups.
 Morbidity was identical in the two groups with the exception of postoperative seromas.
 The prevalence of seroma was 23% in the muscle-sparing group and 0% in the standard incision group (p = 0.0125).
 We have demonstrated that the muscle-sparing incision may be a reasonable alternative to the standard posterolateral approach.

7,"Blunt trauma in children: significance of peritoneal fluid.
 Seven hundred ninety consecutively seen children who had not undergone peritoneal lavage underwent imaging with computed tomography (CT) after blunt trauma.
 Collections of peritoneal fluid were prospectively characterized as small (51 children), moderate (32 children), or large (40 children).
 Associated injuries included hepatic or splenic injury in 74%, isolated renal or pancreatic injury in 5%, isolated pelvic fracture in 5%, isolated hollow viscus injury in 5%, and a combination of the above in 7%.
 Peritoneal fluid was the only CT abnormality in three children.
 A significant correlation was found between presence and increasing size of peritoneal fluid collections and clinical signs of hemodynamic instability such as lower trauma score (P = .0008 by analysis of variance), the presence of arterial hypotension (P = .0001 by chi 2 test), and hematocrit less than 30% (0.30) (P = .0001 by chi 2 test).
 Additionally, the presence and amount of peritoneal fluid correlated with need for laparotomy and with mortality (P = .0001 by chi 2 test for both).

 Traditional measures of head and neck tumors often fail to predict patient outcome or clinical course, particularly in nonadvanced disease.
 This problem of unpredictable tumor behavior has been one focus of cell proliferation studies.
 Such studies, however, have been limited by difficult methodology.
 A newer method of quantifying tumor cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine is applicable for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, as shown in the present study.
 The relative ease with which cell proliferation can be evaluated using this technique will allow large numbers of head and neck tumors to be studied, enabling correlations with tumor behavior to be made.

10,"Prothymosin alpha antisense oligomers inhibit myeloma cell division.
 The function of prothymosin alpha has been investigated by using four different antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides directed at selected regions of its mRNA.
 In every case, when synchronized human myeloma cells were released from stationary phase by incubation in fresh medium containing antisense oligomers, cell division was prevented or inhibited; sense oligomers and random antisense oligomers had no effect.
 A detailed analysis of synchronized cell populations indicated that sense-treated and untreated cells divided approximately 17 hr after growth initiation, whereas cells incubated with antisense oligomer 183, a 16-mer targeted 5 bases downstream of the initiation codon, entered mitosis approximately one cell division late.
 The failure to divide correlated directly with a deficit in prothymosin alpha and with the continued presence of intact intracellular antisense oligomers over a period of at least 24 hr.
 Because antisense oligomers had no effect either on the timing of the induction of prothymosin alpha mRNA upon growth stimulation or on mRNA levels seen throughout the cell cycle, we concluded that antisense DNA caused specific hybrid arrest of translation.
 Our data suggest that prothymosin alpha is required for cell division.
 However, there is no evidence that prothymosin alpha directly regulates mitosis.

11,"Video display terminals and the risk of spontaneous abortion.
 BACKGROUND.
 The relation between spontaneous abortion and the use of video display terminals (VDTs) is of great public health concern.
 Previous investigators of this issue have reported inconsistent findings.
 METHODS.
 To determine whether electromagnetic fields emitted by VDTs are associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, a cohort of female telephone operators who used VDTs at work was compared with a cohort of operators who did not use VDTs.
 To obtain reliable estimates of exposure, we determined the number of hours of VDT use per week from company records and measured electromagnetic fields at VDT workstations and, for purposes of comparison, at workstations without VDTs.
 Operators who used VDTs had higher abdominal exposure to very-low-frequency (15 kHz) electromagnetic fields (workstations without VDTs did not emit very-low-frequency energy).
 Abdominal exposure to extremely-low-frequency fields (45 to 60 Hz) was similar for both operators who used VDTs and those who did not.
 Among 2430 women interviewed, there were 882 pregnancies that met our criteria for inclusion in the study.
 RESULTS.
 We found no excess risk of spontaneous abortion among women who used VDTs during the first trimester of pregnancy (odds ratio = 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to 1.38), and no dose-response relation was apparent when we examined the women's hours of VDT use per week (odds ratio for 1 to 25 hours per week = 1.04; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.79; odds ratio for greater than 25 hours per week = 1.00; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.64).
 There continued to be no risk associated with the use of VDTs when we accounted for multiple pregnancies, conducted separate analyses of early abortion, late abortion, and all fetal losses, or limited our analyses to spontaneous abortions for which a physician was consulted.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The use of VDTs and exposure to the accompanying electromagnetic fields were not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion in this study.

12,"Fludarabine phosphate: a synthetic purine antimetabolite with significant activity against lymphoid malignancies.
 Fludarabine phosphate is the 2-fluoro, 5'-monophosphate derivative of vidarabine (ara-A) with the advantages of resistance to deamination by adenosine deaminase (ADA) and improved solubility.
 The mechanism of cytotoxic action of the compound appears to involve metabolic conversion to the active triphosphate.
 Fludarabine phosphate has substantial activity against lymphoid malignancies, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
 Its single-agent activity in CLL appears at least comparable to those of other conventional combination regimens.
 Its activity in Hodgkin's disease, mycosis fungoides, and macroglobulinemia, although suggestive, needs to be further defined and clinical trials are warranted in hairy cell leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia, and previously untreated myeloma.
 The compound does not appear active against most common solid tumors.
 Early clinical trials indicated significant myelosuppression and the potential for severe neurotoxicity.
 Toxicity on the currently used low-dose schedules includes transient and reversible myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence/fatigue, and elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum creatinine.
 Possible pulmonary toxicity has been suggested in several patients.
 The currently used low-doses of fludarabine phosphate, even with repeated administration, are well tolerated and appear safe with a negligible risk for severe neurotoxicity.
 Based on its single-agent activity and tolerability, the Food and Drug Administration recently granted group C designation of the drug for the treatment of patients with refractory CLL outside the clinical trials setting.
 The use of fludarabine phosphate in combination regimens and its impact on the natural history of the lymphoid malignancies is yet to be determined.
 Fludarabine phosphate may well occupy a pivotal role in the management of CLL and low-grade NHL.

13,"Application of pulsed and continuous wave 1.32 and 1.06 microns wavelengths of the Nd:YAG laser in the canine tracheobronchial tree: a comparative study.
 Previous investigations have shown good clinical potential for the use of the 1.32 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser because its soft tissue absorption is better than that of the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser.
 The 1.32 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser has an absorption coefficient in water that is 10 times higher than the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser.
 A comparative in vivo study of laser soft tissue effects was performed by using the 1.32 microns wavelength and the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG lasers in a pulsed wave (PW) mode and continuous wave (CW) mode using a non-contact endoscopic delivery system.
 A standard 5 mm mucosal lesion was made in the canine tracheobronchial tree down to the level of the perichondrium.
 Soft tissue and cartilage effects were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy, acutely, 1 week and 2 weeks after operation, and a comparison was made between the different laser modalities.
 To create similar lesions, higher energy was required when using the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser.
 Soft tissue injury was greater with the 1.06 microns wavelength in CW mode, and no cartilage damage occurred in the PW mode.
 Soft tissue and cartilage repair after 1 and 2 weeks was better with the 1.32 microns wavelength laser.
 In comparison, the CO2 laser and the contact Nd:YAG laser proved to be more precise cutting tools than the 1.32 microns wavelength or the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG lasers.
 Both Nd:YAG laser wavelengths were useful for coagulation and vaporization of tissues and blood vessels.
 More studies are needed to determine the effect of the new 1.32 microns wavelengths on endotracheal tumors.

14,"The perception of life events and daily stress in nonulcer dyspepsia.
 Previous studies on the association of nonulcer dyspepsia with major life events were performed without emphasis on the perception of these events, and have yielded conflicting results.
 The present study examined the perception of life events and, in addition, the role of daily ""hassles"" (stressful events) in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia.
 Thirty-three dyspeptic patients as defined by normal endoscopy and ultrasonogram and 33 controls of comparable sex, age, and social class were recruited for study.
 Both groups were asked to select from 56 major life events those they had experienced and to give a rating on how they perceived them.
 They were further asked to select similarly from 117 items of daily stress and to rate the severity of each item.
 The results demonstrated that the number of positive and negative events and the positive score were similar in both dyspeptic patients and controls, but dyspeptic patients had a higher perceived magnitude of negative events and a higher score of total life change as given by the summation of magnitude of positive and negative events (both p less than 0.05).
 The ""hassles"" scores were not significantly different between dyspeptic patients and controls.
 Analysis of individual life events revealed that dyspeptic patients had significantly (p less than 0.05) higher scores than controls in items of minor law violations, major change in closeness of family members, and major personal illness or injury.
 We conclude that patients with nonulcer dyspepsia have higher negative perception of major life events, which indicates that psychological factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of nonulcer dyspepsia.

15,"Effectiveness of radiotherapy with radical neck dissection in cancers of the head and neck.
 A retrospective analysis of 457 radical neck dissections performed over a 30-year period for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx was carried out.
 Two hundred thirteen patients underwent radiotherapy to the primary cancer site and/or to the neck.
 Of these, 164 underwent perioperative adjuvant radiotherapy and 24 underwent definitive radiation for cure and were followed up by salvage surgery.
 Thus, 188 patients received radiotherapy for nonrecurrent disease.
 Twenty-five additional patients underwent radiation for surgical failure following radical neck dissection.
 The goal of the study was to determine whether radiotherapy altered the course or end result of the disease.
 The T and N stage at onset of disease was similar for the radiotherapy and nonradiotherapy groups.
 Preoperative radiotherapy was effective in down staging the disease at the primary site and, to a lesser extent, in the lymph nodes, but had limited impact on survival.
 Failure to control the disease in the neck occurred in 60 (32%) of the 188 patients who received radiotherapy for primary disease; recurrence rates were lower in the combined therapy group than in the surgical group of patients with N2 and N3 stages of disease.
 The 3-year disease-free survival was 45%; this was no better than the 63% survival rate in patients who did not receive radiotherapy, although survival was better in the combined therapy group for patients with N3 stage of disease.
 The worst results were in those patients who were irradiated for surgical failure (14% survival); the 24 patients who required salvage radical neck dissection following failure of definitive radiotherapy for cure had a 42% survival.

16,"Heart rate adjustment of exercise-induced ST segment depression. Improved risk stratification in the Framingham Offspring Study 
 BACKGROUND.
 Simple heart rate adjustment of ST segment depression during exercise (delta ST/HR index) and the pattern of ST depression as a function of heart rate during exercise and recovery (the rate-recovery loop) have been shown to improve the ability of the exercise electrocardiogram to detect the presence of coronary heart disease (CHD), but the performance of these methods for the prediction of future coronary events remains to be examined.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 We compared the delta ST/HR index and the rate-recovery loop with standard electrocardiographic criteria for prediction of CHD events in 3,168 asymptomatic men and women in the Framingham Offspring Study who underwent treadmill exercise electrocardiography and who, at entry, were free of clinical and electrocardiographic evidence of CHD.
 After a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, there were 65 new CHD events: four sudden deaths, 24 new myocardial infarctions, and 37 incident cases of angina pectoris.
 When a Cox proportional hazards model with adjustment for age and sex was used, a positive exercise electrocardiogram by standard criteria (greater than or equal to 0.1 mV horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression) was not predictive of new CHD events (chi 2 = 0.40, p = 0.52).
 In contrast, stratification according to the presence or absence of a positive delta ST/HR index (greater than or equal to 1.6 microV/beat/min) and a positive (counterclockwise) rate-recovery loop was associated with CHD event risk (chi 2 = 9.45, p less than 0.01) and separated subjects into three groups with varying risks of coronary events: high risk, when both tests were positive (relative risk 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-5.4); intermediate risk, when either the delta ST/HR index or the rate-recovery loop was positive (relative risk, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.8); and low risk, when both tests were negative.
 After multivariate adjustment for age, sex, smoking, total cholesterol level, fasting glucose level, diastolic blood pressure, and electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, the combined delta ST/HR index and rate-recovery loop criteria remained predictive of coronary events (chi 2 = 5.45, p = 0.02).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Heart rate adjustment of ST segment depression by the delta ST/HR index and the rate-recovery loop during exercise electrocardiography can improve prediction of future coronary events in asymptomatic men and women.

17,"How American oncologists treat breast cancer: an assessment of the influence of clinical trials.
 The present study was designed to assess the preferred methods of treatment of breast cancer by American oncologists, and the impact of clinical trials on their practice.
 We mailed 465 questionnaires to surgical, radiation, or medical oncologists.
 The questionnaire described five hypothetic patients with breast cancer, and respondents were asked to select their preferred treatment for each patient.
 For primary breast cancer, most physicians would offer the choice of local excision followed by radiation therapy or modified radical mastectomy.
 About 80% of physicians would prescribe adjuvant chemotherapy for a premenopausal woman with estrogen receptor-negative, axillary node negative breast cancer, and for a postmenopausal woman with estrogen receptor-negative, node-positive disease.
 This policy was favored by male and female physicians of each specialty.
 Almost all respondents would treat a young woman with inflammatory breast cancer with initial chemotherapy followed by radiation and/or surgery, and about 60% would recommend chemotherapy to a postmenopausal patient with estrogen receptor-negative disease and minimally symptomatic bone metastases.
 Clinical trials have compared treatment strategies that could be applied to patients described in our questionnaire.
 Preferred treatments for primary breast cancer, and for inflammatory breast cancer are supported by the results of clinical trials.
 Recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy for node-negative breast cancer is not based on a consistent demonstration of improvement in survival, although randomized trials with short follow-up have shown delay to recurrence.
 Recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy for a postmenopausal woman with node-positive breast cancer is contrary to the results of large randomized controlled trials (and to a meta-analysis), which have shown that this policy does not lead to improved survival.
 Our report suggests that even large randomized clinical trials may have a minimal impact on practice if their results run counter to belief in the value of the treatment.

18,"Forearm blood flow response to posture change in the very old: non-invasive measurement by venous occlusion plethysmography.
 Little is known about the peripheral vascular response to posture change in very elderly people who are vulnerable to the development of orthostatic hypotension.
 This is due, in part, to the risks of currently utilized invasive vascular monitoring techniques in the elderly population.
 We studied the forearm vascular response to active standing in 18 healthy young, 10 healthy old, and 19 impaired elderly subjects, using the non-invasive technique of venous occlusion plethysmography.
 In six subjects this technique was compared to duplex doppler ultrasonography for the measurement of postural changes in forearm blood flow.
 Forearm blood flow changes determined by venous occlusion plethysmography were 11% larger than doppler measurements, but the two methods strongly correlated (r = 0.90, P less than .001).
 Mean forearm vascular resistance increased to a significantly greater extent at 1 minute of standing in young subjects than in both groups of old, although the response was quite variable in all groups.
 Two healthy elderly (20%) and eight impaired elderly (40%) subjects had unexpected forearm vasodilatation at 1 minute of standing.
 By 3 minutes, forearm vascular resistance had increased by similar amounts in all three groups of subjects.
 Five impaired elderly and no healthy young or healthy old subjects had orthostatic hypotension, defined as greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg decline in mean arterial blood pressure at 1 or 3 minutes of standing.
 Forearm vascular resistance changes did not correlate with blood pressure response to standing.
 Thus, forearm vascular response to 1 minute of active standing is attenuated in many elderly subjects.
 This abnormality may impair adaptation to orthostatic stress in advanced age.

 The surgical complications for the first 153 multiple-channel cochlear implant operations carried out at the Medizinische Hochschule in Hannover and the first 100 operations at the University of Melbourne Clinic, The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, are presented.
 In the Hannover experience the major complications were wound breakdown, wound infection, electrode tie erosion through the external auditory canal, electrode slippage, a persistent increase in tinnitus, and facial nerve stimulation.
 The incidence of wound breakdown requiring removal of the package was 0.6% in Hannover and 1.0% in Melbourne.
 The complications for the operation at both clinics were at acceptable levels.
 It was considered that wound breakdown requiring implant removal could be kept to a minimum by making a generous incision and suturing the flap without tension.

 Interatrial shunt flow profiles in 36 normal term infants were examined serially by colour flow and pulsed Doppler echocardiographic techniques from within an hour of birth to four or five days after birth.
 Shunt flow across the foramen ovale was detected in 33 normal infants (92%) within an hour of birth (mean 40 minutes).
 The occurrence of interatrial shunting decreased with age, but a shunt signal was still detected in 17 infants (47%) on the fourth or fifth day of life, by then the ductus arteriosus had already closed in all the normal infants.
 The direction of interatrial shunt flow was predominantly left-to-right, but in 64% there was a coexistent small right-to-left shunt in diastole within an hour of birth; by four to five days it was found in 19%.
 In the six patients with persistent fetal circulation the direction of the interatrial shunt flow was predominantly right-to-left with biphasic peaks in diastole and systole at the early stage of the disease, and the period of right-to-left shunt flow during each cardiac cycle was significantly longer than that in normal infants examined within 1 hour of birth.
 In all patients the ductus closed before the foramen ovale.
 At the time of ductal closure in all patients with persistent fetal circulation right-to-left shunt flow was seen during diastole and its period was still prolonged.
 These findings suggest that interatrial shunting, predominantly left-to-right, is common in normal newborn infants.

 Technetium-99m-Hexamibi [Hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium (i)] was developed as a myocardial perfusion agent with biologic properties similar to those of thallium-201 (201TI).
 As 201TI has recently been observed to be of value for the diagnosis of brain tumors when used in conjunction with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging technology, the possibility that the biologic similarity of the two radiopharmaceuticals extended to their affinity for tumors was tested.
 A 5-yr-old female patient with a brain stem astrocytoma showed marked focal uptake of 99mTc-Hexamibi at the site of tumor recurrence as defined by biopsy and prior 201TI/SPECT study.
 Tumor-to-normal cortex radioactivity ratios for the 99mTc-Hexamibi/SPECT study were 132:1 and the spatial resolution of the 99mTc-Hexamibi images was high.
 This observation suggests that 99mTc-Hexamibi merits further study as a potential agent for SPECT imaging of human brain tumors.

 A randomized trial was performed to determine if therapy with tamoxifen (TAM) plus fluoxymesterone (FLU) was more efficacious than TAM alone for postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer.
 Patients failing TAM could subsequently receive FLU.
 The dose of both drugs was 10 mg orally twice daily.
 Objective responses were seen in 50 of 119 (42%) TAM patients and 64 of 119 (54%) TAM plus FLU patients (two-sided P = 0.07).
 Time to disease progression was better for TAM plus FLU (medians: 11.6 versus 6.5 months; Cox model, P = 0.03).
 Duration of response and survival were similar in the two treatment arms.
 Among 97 patients with estrogen receptor (ER) of 10 or greater and 65 years of age or older, there were highly significant advantages for treatment with TAM plus FLU in both response rate and time to progression.
 Of particular note is that in this patient group TAM plus FLU showed a survival advantage (Cox model, P = 0.05).
 Although these data require confirmation in a prospective randomized trial, they suggest that there is a substantive therapeutic advantage for TAM plus FLU over TAM alone in elderly women with ER of 10 fmol or greater.

 It has been suggested that the decline of cardiac output with age is due to increased prevalence of disease, particularly occult coronary artery disease.
 Therefore, the relation of cardiac output (direct oxygen Fick method) to age was analyzed in 110 sixteen- to 64-year-old men with World Health Organization stage I or II essential hypertension at the time of the hemodynamic study, who were alive and free of cardiovascular complications 7 years later.
 At supine and seated rest, during upright bicycle exercise at 50 W and and at peak work load, cardiac output was inversely (p less than 0.01) related to age.
 These relations were independent of weight and mean intraarterial pressure.
 Stroke volume decreased with advancing age at supine rest, but not at rest and during exercise in the seated position.
 Heart rate was not affected by age in the supine position, but was slower in older patients during upright rest and at peak exercise.
 In conclusion, in patients with essential hypertension who remained free of cardiovascular complications for 7 years, cardiac output was independently and inversely related to age at various levels of activity.
 These findings suggest that occult cardiovascular disease does not explain the decline in cardiac output with age in patients with essential hypertension.

26,"Antibody to human retroviruses among drug users in three east coast American cities, 1972-1976.
 Between 1972 and 1976, 585 persons attending methadone maintenance clinics at East Coast veterans hospitals were enrolled in a survey of hepatitis antibody prevalence.
 Sera were tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV) using both HTLV-I and HTLV-II immunoblots.
 Clinical and death records were also reviewed.
 None of the sera had HIV antibodies (upper 95% confidence limit, 0.5%); however, 103 (18%) had reactivity to HTLV.
 The profile of reactivity suggested that these subjects had been exposed to HTLV-II rather than to HTLV-I.
 Prevalence was as high in the early 1970s as today and correlated with duration of drug use rather than age.
 Neither cancers, specific neurologic diseases, nor excess deaths from any cause (overall 14%) could be ascribed to seropositivity.
 Therefore, HTLV (probably HTLV-II) has been a common infection of drug users for many years but adverse outcomes following infection were not demonstrated.

27,"Genetic mapping of new DNA probes at Xq27 defines a strategy for DNA studies in the fragile X syndrome.
 The fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of familial mental retardation and is characterized by a fragile site at the end of the long arm of the X chromosome.
 The unusual genetics and cytogenetics of this X-linked condition make genetic counseling difficult.
 DNA studies were of limited value in genetic counseling, because the nearest polymorphic DNA loci had recombination fractions of 12% or more with the fragile X mutation, FRAXA.
 Five polymorphic loci have recently been described in this region of the X chromosome.
 The positions of these loci in relation to FRAXA were defined in a genetic linkage study of 112 affected families.
 The five loci--DXS369, DXS297, DXS296, IDS, and DXS304--had recombination fractions of 4% or less with FRAXA.
 The closest locus, DXS296, was distal to FRAXA and had a recombination fraction of 2%.
 The polymorphisms at these loci can be detected in DNA enzymatically digested with a limited number of restriction endonucleases.
 A strategy for DNA studies which is based on three restriction endonucleases and on five probes will detect one or more of these polymorphisms in 94% of women.
 This strategy greatly increases the utility of DNA studies in providing genetic advice to families with the fragile X syndrome.

 A 62-year-old man with unstable angina due to severe narrowing of the left main trunk (LMT) was examined.
 Emergency bypass surgery was performed with an internal mammary artery graft, instead of a saphenous vein graft, because of the thickened, edematous ascending aorta.
 Postoperative coronary angiography showed the lesion of the LMT markedly regressing.
 Presumably, this stenotic lesion of the LMT was caused by active aortitis and was partially reversible by steroid administration both during and after surgery.

 STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the marked increase in the plasma concentrations of epinephrine during cardiopulmonary arrest and basic life support (BLS) could be due in part to decreased distribution and/or elimination.
 DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: Dogs were randomly assigned to undergo adrenalectomy or sham-operation.
 Some adrenalectomized animals received an epinephrine infusion.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the seven sham-operated dogs, the plasma epinephrine concentrations increased markedly during BLS as expected.
 In the seven adrenalectomized dogs receiving a constant infusion of epinephrine, cardiopulmonary arrest and BLS induced a three to sixfold increase in plasma epinephrine concentrations, with an increase in the mean plasma epinephrine concentrations (calculated from the area under the curve) of 1.21 +/- 0.12 ng/mL (P less than .05).
 In the seven adrenalectomized dogs receiving a constant epinephrine infusion but not subjected to cardiopulmonary arrest, the plasma epinephrine concentrations remained stable.
 Finally, in the seven adrenalectomized dogs not receiving an epinephrine infusion, the mean plasma epinephrine concentrations during BLS (calculated from the area under the curve) increased only by 0.05 +/- 0.04 ng/mL, significantly less than in adrenalectomized dogs receiving an epinephrine infusion (P less than .01).
 CONCLUSION: The increase in plasma epinephrine concentrations during cardiopulmonary arrest and BLS is due in part to an altered disposition of epinephrine.

 A novel deoxycytidine analog, gemcitabine (2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine [dFdC]), has been studied in a phase I clinical and pharmacology trial.
 Doses ranging from 10 to 1,000 mg/m2 were administered over 30 minutes weekly times 3 weeks every 4 weeks.
 The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 790 mg/m2.
 The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression, with thrombocytopenia and anemia quantitatively more important than granulocytopenia.
 Nonhematologic toxicity was minimal.
 Two responses in patients with adenocarcinomas of the colon and lung were documented.
 The maximum dFdC plasma concentration, reached after 15 minutes of infusion, was proportional to the total dose administered.
 Elimination, due mainly to deamination, was rapid (terminal half-life [t1/2], 8.0 minutes) and dose independent.
 The deamination product 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) was eliminated with biphasic kinetics characterized by a long terminal phase (t1/2, 14 hours); it was the sole metabolite detected in urine.
 The concentration of dFdC 5'-triphosphate in circulating mononuclear cells increased in proportion to the dFdC dose at infusions between 35 and 250 mg/m2.
 No further increment in dFdC 5'-triphosphate (dFdCTP) was observed at higher doses, which resulted in plasma dFdC concentrations greater than 20 mumol/L (350 to 1,000 mg/m2), suggesting saturation of dFdC 5'-phosphate accumulation.
 The recommended dose for phase II clinical trials in solid tumors is 790 mg/m2/wk.

32,"Development and characterization of a new, highly specific antibody to the human chorionic gonadotropin-beta fragment.
 In addition to high concentrations of hCG, pregnancy urine contains even higher concentrations of a fragment of the hCG beta-subunit.
 This biologically inactive material complicates immunological measurement of hCG, since it cross-reacts with many polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the hCG beta-subunit that are employed for assays of hCG in urine.
 Although we and others have developed antibodies to this fragment, specific measurement of the fragment in the presence of free hCG beta has remained difficult due to intrinsic cross-reactivity of these antibodies with the intact hCG beta.
 Rather than attempt to increase specificity by assay optimization, we developed a new, highly specific monoclonal antibody, designated B210, which cross-reacts less than 0.1% with the free hCG beta-subunit in both liquid and solid phase immunoassay formats.
 We have used this new monoclonal antibody in immunoradiometric assays to measure specifically the hCG beta fragment in urine throughout pregnancy as well as in the sera of two individuals with cancers producing the hCG beta-subunit.
 We discovered that the hCG beta fragment can bind three monoclonal antibodies simultaneously, indicating that although the epitope for antibody B210 is a new determinant exposed on the hCG beta fragment and not on intact hCG or on free hCG beta-subunit, the hCG beta fragment retains at least two other hCG beta-related epitopes intact, i.e.
 those that bind monoclonal antibodies B108 and B201.

 Functional overloading of skeletal muscle induces a compensatory hypertrophy as an adaptive response to increased functional demand.
 Overload of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle (129 ReJ strain male mouse) was induced by unilateral surgical removal of a synergistic muscle, tibialis anterior (TA).
 Response of the EDL to overload for 7, 21, and 42 d was analyzed for changes in 1) muscle weight, 2) myofiber type distribution, 3) myofiber cross-sectional area by fiber type, 4) speed of contraction and relaxation of the muscle, 5) force of contraction, and 6) myofiber morphologic integrity.
 The weight of the EDL significantly increased.
 The overload caused no impairment of muscle contractility and did not have a significant effect on isometric twitch contraction time to peak tension or the time to one-half relaxation of the twitch.
 Overloaded muscles demonstrated a transient shift in fiber type profile with preferential hypertrophy of Type IIA fibers that occurred in the early phase of overload while type IIB fibers were recruited by 42 d.
 No significant increase in myofiber number in overloaded muscles occurred.
 Some morphologic changes in over-loaded muscles parallel those found in patients with neurogenic muscular disorders.
 However, overloaded muscle did not exhibit a significant occurrence of fiber branching from controls in the midbelly region of the muscle.

 A group of 103 female weight lifters (WL) and 92 control (C) women answered a survey concerning eating behavior and attitudes (including the Eating Disorder Inventory) and menstrual function.
 The incidence of menstrual dysfunction, defined as oligomenorrhea plus amenorrhea, was significantly higher for the WL (30%) than for the C (13%) not on contraceptive pills.
 Only 2% of the women had amenorrhea.
 The incidence of dysfunction was highest for the subset of 12 WL who had competed in at least one body building competition (COMP); 86% of the COMP not on birth control pills had menstrual dysfunction (P less than 0.05).
 More WL than C reported missing at least one menstrual period during the last year (P = 0.06).
 WL scored significantly higher than C on the Drive for Thinness subscale of the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI).
 Fifteen percent of the WL and 9% of the C achieved the criteria on this subscale for being weight preoccupied (P greater than 0.05).
 Significantly more WL than C responded that they were terrified of becoming fat (WL 56%, C 38%), were obsessed with food (WL 47%, C 30%), used laxatives for weight control (WL 14%, C 1%), and claimed that they had been anorexic in the past (WL 17%, C 5%).
 Examination of the answers of COMP revealed several items that were significantly different from the remainder of the WL.

 Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in the megakaryocytic differentiation.
 Recently, we have observed that IL-6 is synthesized by several human cell lines with megakaryocytic features.
 In this study, we have investigated whether a similar phenomenon occurs during normal megakaryocytic differentiation.
 Human megakaryocytes (MK) were obtained by culturing normal marrow in liquid culture with aplastic plasma (AP).
 First, an IL-6 secretion in bone marrow culture enriched in MK as well as in purified MK populations was demonstrated by a biologic assay.
 Second, IL-6 mRNA was detected in a purified population of MK by the polymerase chain reaction and dot blot analysis.
 IL-6 mRNA and protein were undetectable in platelets.
 Third, in situ hybridization procedure demonstrated the presence of IL-6 mRNA in individual immature MK.
 Fourth, IL-6 protein was detected in MK at the unicellular level by an immunoalkaline phosphatase technique using a monoclonal antibody against IL-6.
 Furthermore, the presence of IL-6 receptor (IL-6-R) on MK was demonstrated by in situ hybridization using an IL-6-R probe and in situ autoradiography after binding with [125I]-labeled recombinant IL-6.
 The IL-6 endogenously produced in liquid cultures containing normal human plasma or AP was subsequently neutralized.
 This resulted in a 50% decrease of the MK growth with a minor shift in the ploidy distribution toward lower values.
 In semisolid cultures the addition of anti-IL-6 antibodies led to a 42% decrease in colony number in cultures stimulated by IL-3 but not in other conditions of culture.
 These results suggest that normal human megakaryocytopoiesis might be regulated in part by an IL-6 autocrine loop.

 Mexican-American men experience reduced cardiovascular mortality compared with non-Hispanic white men.
 There is no corresponding ethnic difference in cardiovascular mortality in women.
 The difference in men could result either from a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease or a lower case fatality rate among Mexican-Americans.
 Although the incidence of cardiovascular disease in Mexican-Americans is unknown, we have collected data on prevalence of myocardial infarction in 5,148 individuals examined in the San Antonio Heart Study, a population-based survey of cardiovascular disease conducted between 1979 and 1988 in Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanic whites aged 25-64 years.
 Myocardial infarction was assessed by Minnesota-coded electrocardiograms and by a self-reported history of a physician-diagnosed heart attack.
 For both end points, the age-adjusted prevalence of myocardial infarction was lower in Mexican-American men than in non-Hispanic white men.
 After adjustment for age and diabetes status (present/absent), the odds of a myocardial infarction, as defined by either criterion, was approximately one third lower in Mexican-American men than in non-Hispanic white men (p = 0.06).
 In women, the prevalence of both myocardial infarction end points was slightly higher in Mexican-Americans than in non-Hispanic whites, although neither of these differences was significant.
 Although the ethnic differences in prevalence in this study were not statistically significant, their pattern parallels the pattern in the mortality due to cardiovascular diseases.
 Therefore, the results support the hypothesis that the reduced cardiovascular mortality rate observed in Mexican-American men reflects a lower incidence of myocardial infarction rather than a reduced case fatality rate because the latter would result in a higher prevalence.

 We report that L-cell-conditioned medium (LCM) transforms porcine cerebral microvascular (PCMV) endothelial cells into cells with macrophage-like properties.
 LCM is known to contain both cytokine(s) and the L-cell virus, a murine retrovirus found in the L929 cell and LCM.
 Our evidence suggests that both LCM cytokine(s) and the L-cell virus are involved in this PCMV endothelial cell transformation.
 Criteria for transformation include focus formation, decreased serum requirements for growth, changes in morphology including nonadherence, propagation in suspension culture, and a decreased growth response to stimulation with a known endothelial cell mitogen.
 Macrophage-like characteristics of this transformed cell, designated as RVTE, include pinocytosis of low-density lipoprotein, Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, phagocytosis of bacteria and zymosan, the expression of macrophage enzyme markers, and constitutive production of colony-stimulating factor 1.
 However, the transformed cell retains several properties of the nontransformed cell including the expression of FVIII:RAg and in vitro self-organization into capillary-like structures.
 Cloning of RVTE cells clearly shows that both macrophage-like and cerebral microvascular endothelial cell properties are present in the same cell.
 During self-organization, nontransformed cells express morphologic and functional characteristics classically associated with the macrophage.
 These findings suggest that some brain capillary pathophysiologies could involve macrophage-like cerebral microvascular endothelial cells.
 Furthermore, the ""reticuloendothelial"" phenotypic repertoire expressed by this transformed cerebral microvascular endothelial cell may show that the cerebral capillary endothelial cell in vivo is derived from a hematopoietic and/or phagocytic precursor.

44,"Myocardial infarct size-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning was not attenuated by oxygen free-radical scavengers in the rabbit.
 BACKGROUND.
 The limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning on infarct size has been reported in canine hearts, which contain considerable amounts of xanthine oxidase, a free radical-producing enzyme.
 Furthermore, a recent study suggested that free radicals generated during preconditioning may contribute to the cardioprotective effect of preconditioning.
 The present study examined 1) whether preconditioning limits infarct size in rabbits, which, like humans, lack myocardial xanthine oxidase and 2) whether the cardioprotective effect of PC is mediated by free radicals.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 A branch of the circumflex coronary artery in rabbits was occluded for 30 minutes and then reperfused for 72 hours.
 Myocardial infarct size and area at risk were determined by histology and fluorescent particles, respectively.
 Five groups were studied: an untreated control group, a preconditioned group (PC group), a high-dose superoxide dismutase (SOD)-treated preconditioned group (high-dose SOD-PC group), a low-dose SOD-treated preconditioned group (low-dose SOD-PC group), and a SOD-plus-catalase-treated preconditioned group (SOD/CAT-PC group).
 Preconditioning was performed with four episodes of 5 minutes of ischemia and 5 minutes of reperfusion.
 The free radical scavengers (30,000 units/kg SOD for high-dose SOD-PC group, 15,000 units/kg SOD for low-dose SOD-PC group, and 30,000 units/kg SOD plus 55,000 units/kg catalase for SOD/CAT-PC group) were infused intravenously over 60 minutes starting 20 minutes before preconditioning.
 Infarct size as the percentage of area at risk was 45.1 +/- 3.5% (mean +/- SEM) in the control group (n = 11), 13.3 +/- 3.0% in the PC group (n = 12), 9.7 +/- 1.8% in the high-dose SOD-PC group (n = 8), 11.9 +/- 2.2% in the low-dose SOD-PC group (n = 6), and 9.6 +/- 2.3% in the SOD/CAT-PC group (n = 6) (p less than 0.05 versus control for the last four values).
 The differences in infarct size as the percent of area at risk among the PC, high-dose SOD-PC, low-dose SOD-PC, and SOD/CAT-PC groups were not significant.
 CONCLUSION.
 Ischemic preconditioning delays ischemic myocardial necrosis regardless of myocardial xanthine oxidase content.
 Free radicals are unlikely to have a major role in the mechanism of the preconditioning in rabbits.

 Free radicals generated from oxidation reactions may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).
 Free radicals are capable of reacting almost instantaneously with membrane lipids and causing lipid peroxidation, membrane injury, and cell death.
 Dopamine is metabolized by oxidation reactions capable of generating free radicals.
 Recent evidence indicates that the substantia nigra of patients with PD contains increased iron, which enhances oxidation, and decreased glutathione, which protects against the formation of free radicals.
 Further, the end products of lipid peroxidation are increased in the substantia nigra of patients with PD, supporting the notions that free radicals are being generated and may contribute to dopamine neuronal death.
 This hypothesis suggests that antioxidant therapies may slow the rate of progression of PD and raises concern that metabolites of levodopa therapy may accelerate the rate of neuronal degeneration.

 Transcription of the thyroglobulin (TG) gene is stimulated by TSH via cAMP.
 We have characterized the sequence elements responsible for the hormone-dependent expression of TG gene in rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells using internal deletion and linker-scanning mutants of the minimal TG promoter (-170 basepairs) fused with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene.
 The TG gene is regulated by at least two regions located between -165 and -140 bp (TG-III) and between -95 and -65 bp (TG-I) from the transcription initiation site.
 The intervening region can be deleted without significant effect on the promoter activity.
 Either of the two regions alone does not promote hormone-dependent transcription.
 A DNase footprinting assay showed that TG-I and TG-III are the principal protein-binding sites and that the proteins interacting with these two regions are induced by TSH or cAMP.
 These results suggest that the hormone-dependent expression of TG gene may be achieved by cooperative interaction of the proteins bound to TG-I and TG-III.

 These epithelial cells use alpha 2 beta 1 as a collagen receptor and alpha 3 beta 1 as a fibronectin receptor, while alpha 6 beta 4 is the major basement membrane receptor.
 Expression of alpha 5 beta 1 complex is low.
 Processing of beta 1 integrins is fast in keratinocytes; half-maximal maturation takes only 3 hours.
 In addition to their function in cell-matrix interactions, beta 1 integrins (alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1) have also a role in maintaining keratinocyte cell-cell interactions.
 It is possible that resting basal keratinocytes use beta 1 integrins as cell-cell adhesion receptors, and during activation, like in wound healing, these receptors relocalize to mediate events involving cell-matrix interactions.

 An interscalene brachial plexus block was performed via a catheter with 20-28 ml of 0.75% bupivacaine plus adrenaline for surgery of the shoulder region in 12 patients.
 Constant infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine 0.25 mg kg-1 h-1 was continued for 24 h.
 During surgery light general anaesthesia, without analgesics, was maintained.
 Plasma concentrations of total and unbound (free fraction) bupivacaine, desbutylbupivacaine (DBB), 4-hydroxybupivacaine (4-OHB) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) were measured at predetermined intervals during the continuous block.
 The greatest mean plasma concentrations of bupivacaine were measured at 30 min (1.63 (SD 0.55) micrograms ml-1) and 60 min (1.38 (0.48) micrograms ml-1).
 There was a small but statistically significant increase in the plasma concentration of bupivacaine between 12 and 24 h of infusion.
 The mean unbound concentration of bupivacaine in plasma decreased from 0.044 (0.015) microgram ml-1 (3.6 (1.1)% of total bupivacaine concentration) at 3 h to 0.023 (0.011) micrograms ml-1 (2.1 (1.0)%) at 24 h.
 The AAG concentration in plasma increased by 38% in 24 h.
 The metabolites DBB and 4-OHB were detectable in plasma from 30 min, with a gradual increase during infusion.
 At 24 h the mean concentrations of DBB and 4-OHB were 0.33 (0.22) micrograms ml-1 and 0.13 (0.04) micrograms ml-1, respectively.
 There were no toxic reactions during the blocks.

 In this study, a recently marketed proprietary finger blood pressure monitor, the Marshall, Astro F-88, was compared with the standard auscultative brachial mercury sphygmomanometer on 125 subjects.
 Measurements were undertaken according to the standards set by the American Heart Association.
 Sensitivity of the finger blood pressure measurement was 76% for systolic and 75% for diastolic blood pressure in diagnosis of high blood pressure (systolic greater than 140 mm Hg and diastolic greater than 90 mm Hg).
 Specificity was 86% for systolic and 82% for diastolic blood pressure.
 Positive predictive values were 58% for systolic and 38% for diastolic blood pressure in the study population in which prevalence of hypertension was 12%.
 The correlation coefficient (Pearson) for systolic values between devices was 0.76 (P less than .0001) and 0.57 (P less than .0001) for diastolic pressure.
 Values obtained by the finger monitor were found to be higher than those obtained by the mercury sphygmomanometer.
 Mean differences and standard deviations (paired t test) for systolic and diastolic pressures between the two devices were 2.3 +/- 14.9 mm Hg (P less than .08) and 2.9 +/- 14.5 mm Hg (P less than .02), respectively.
 These values are not in accordance with the proposed national standards because only 48% of the systolic and 37% of the diastolic blood pressure measurements were within 5 mm Hg of the mercury sphygmomanometer measurements.
 Therefore, although these differences may well be due to different techniques of monitoring employed by the devices, this device is not recommended for evaluation of blood pressure.

59,"Insulin-like growth factors are mitogenic for human keratinocytes and a squamous cell carcinoma.
 Normal adult human keratinocytes in monolayer culture and SCL-1, a skin-derived squamous-cell carcinoma cell line, were investigated for the expression of receptors for insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and insulin.
 As demonstrated by affinity crosslinking, radiolabeled IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin bound specifically to both cell types.
 Each cell expressed type I IGF receptors, with affinity for IGF-1 greater than IGF-2 much greater than insulin.
 Insulin receptors, with highest affinity for insulin, were also present on both cells.
 However, keratinocytes and SCL-1 cells differed in 125I-IGF-2 binding.
 125I-IGF-2-bound to both type I and type II IGF receptors in normal keratinocytes, but bound predominantly to membrane-associated IGF binding proteins in SCL-1.
 IGF-1 was slightly more potent than IGF-2 in stimulating growth of both keratinocytes and SCL-1 cells.
 In keratinocytes, concentrations of IGF-1 ranging from 5-100 ng/ml, and of IGF-2 from 50-100 ng/ml, resulted in a significant increase in cell number.
 At the maximum dose of 100 ng/ml, either IGF-1 or IGF-2 caused a 2.3-times increase in cell number.
 In SCL-1 cells, IGF-1 was more potent than IGF-2 or insulin at lower concentrations, but either IGF-1 or IGF-2 at the maximal concentration of 333 ng/ml stimulated a 4.7-times increase in thymidine incorporation.
 The stimulatory effect of insulin in SCL-1 was 10-50 times less potent than that of the IGF.
 The effect of either IGF on SCL-1 was completely inhibited by the type I IGF receptor antibody alpha IR-3, suggesting that both IGFs are mitogenic through the type I IGF receptor.
 Insulin action was partially blocked by alpha IR-3, suggesting that insulin can act through both the insulin and type I IGF receptors.
 It thus appears that IGF-1 and IGF-2 are mitogens for normal and transformed human keratinocytes and that their actions are primarily mediated through the type I IGF receptor, whereas insulin is a mitogen through both the IGF-1 receptor and the insulin receptor.

 In a 5-year study, 425 women had conization performed for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, II or III.
 Conization was performed only in cases of positive endocervical curettage or when colposcopy was inconclusive.
 In all other cases, local destruction was the operation of choice.
 In the early years of the study, conization was done by the cold-knife method (N = 201), whereas CO2 laser was used in the latter part of the study (N = 224).
 Success and complication rates were the same for the two methods.
 Abnormal cytology after conization was found in a total of 53 cases (12.5%), but a histologic confirmation of residual or recurrent CIN was made in only 27 women (6.4%).
 This corresponds to a success rate of 92% after cold-knife and 95% after laser conization.
 The CIN grading of the residual or recurrent CIN was similar to or less than the CIN diagnosis of the cone.
 Because our success rate was comparable to that of other series with much less strict referral criteria, our policy seems adequate.

 Melanoma is the second most common cancer, after testicular cancer, in males in the U.S.
 Navy.
 A wide range of occupations with varying exposures to sunlight and other possible etiologic agents are present in the Navy.
 Person-years at risk and cases of malignant melanoma were ascertained using computerized service history and inpatient hospitalization files maintained at the Naval Health Research Center.
 A total of 176 confirmed cases of melanoma were identified in active-duty white male enlisted Navy personnel during 1974-1984.
 Risk of melanoma was determined for individual occupations and for occupations grouped by review of job descriptions into three categories of sunlight exposure: (1) indoor, (2) outdoor, or (3) indoor and outdoor.
 Compared with the U.S.
 civilian population, personnel in indoor occupations had a higher age-adjusted incidence rate of melanoma, i.e., 10.6 per 100,000 (p = .06).
 Persons who worked in occupations that required spending time both indoors and outdoors had the lowest rate, i.e., 7.0 per 100,000 (p = .06).
 Incidence rates of melanoma were higher on the trunk than on the more commonly sunlight-exposed head and arms.
 Two single occupations were found to have elevated rates of melanoma: (1) aircrew survival equipmentman, SIR = 6.8 (p less than .05); and (2) engineman, SIR = 2.8 (p less than .05).
 However, there were no cases of melanoma or no excess risk in occupations with similar job descriptions.
 Findings on the anatomical site of melanoma from this study suggest a protective role for brief, regular exposure to sunlight and fit with recent laboratory studies that have shown vitamin D to suppress growth of malignant melanoma cells in tissue culture.
 A mechanism is proposed in which vitamin D inhibits previously initiated melanomas from becoming clinically apparent.

 We compared four diagnostic data sets for the assessment of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease.
 Fifty-four chorea-free persons were evaluated by neurological examination, positron emission tomography measurement of glucose metabolism, radiographic computerized tomographic measurement of caudate size, and genetic testing at the polymorphic DNA loci D4S10, D4S43, and D4S125.
 Twelve (22%) persons had abnormal caudate metabolism, 6 (11%) had subtle abnormalities of motor control, and 7 (13%) had computed tomographic evidence of caudate atrophy, compared with an expected gene frequency of 34% for this population.
 In 20 persons with unambiguous genetic test results or the subsequent phenotypic expression of Huntington's disease (chorea), there was a greater sensitivity of the positron emission tomographic measurement of caudate metabolism (75%) relative to computed tomography (33%) or the clinical examination (17%) for the determination of a subpopulation of probable Huntington's disease gene carriers.
 Hypometabolism of the putamen and globus pallidus, and hypermetabolism of the precentral gyrus were also associated with a high probability of carrying the Huntington's disease gene.
 The findings support the hypothesis that abnormalities of cerebral metabolism precede clinical or structural (computed tomographic) abnormalities in gene-positive individuals at risk for Huntington's disease.

 In ongoing reviews of 339 patients with surgically treated primary squamous cell carcinoma, there were 19 (5.6%) with concurrent gastric cancer and 11 (3.2%) with head and neck cancer.
 The incidences of intra-esophageal multiple occurrence of esophageal cancer are 27.3% and 26.3% in those with associated head and neck cancer and gastric cancer, respectively, and higher than 7.1% in those without such a concurrent cancer.
 There was no difference in the clinicopathological characteristics of those with concurrent head and neck and gastric cancers, except for the higher incidence of metachronous occurrence in the former.
 These findings suggest that, in cases of esophageal cancer associated with concurrent head and neck cancer and gastric cancer, intraesophageal multiplicity of the esophageal carcinoma is frequent and that preoperative serial evaluations is most important to design treatment and estimate the prognosis.

 Severe arrhythmias occur predictably on reperfusion after 5 minutes of coronary occlusion in the rat.
 There is little data available on whether ischemic preconditioning (PC) of hearts can reduce the incidence of such arrhythmias.
 The effect of PC (three cycles of 2 minutes of coronary occlusion and 5 minutes of reperfusion) on development of arrhythmias after a subsequent 5-minute coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion was studied.
 Rats (n = 16 each group) underwent 5-minute occlusion and reperfusion alone or preceded by PC; arrhythmias were monitored during ischemia and for 10 minutes of reperfusion, and biopsies were taken for creatine phosphate and adenosine triphosphate in ischemic and nonischemic zones of the left ventricle.
 PC reduced the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) during occlusion (81% control versus 13% PC, p less than 0.001).
 On subsequent reperfusion, ventricular fibrillation (VF) developed in zero PC animals versus 13 (81%) of controls (p less than 0.001), and irreversible VF in zero of PC versus seven (44%) of controls (p = 0.007).
 VT occurred in four (25%) of PC versus all (100%) of controls (p less than 0.001).

 Thirty-six (72%) of the 50 had 1 or more CNS tumors.
 The most frequently affected sites in the CNS excluding the retina were the cerebellum (52%), spinal cord (44%), and brainstem (18%).
 New regional predilections for the craniocervical junction and conus medullaris were demonstrated by this study.
 Forty-one percent of all VHL patients with CNS tumors were neurologically asymptomatic: cerebellar tumors (50%), spinal cord tumors (50%), and brainstem tumors (44%) were often without clinical signs or symptoms.
 Multiple lesions were common.
 The mean age of all VHL patients (34.5 years) was similar to the mean age of all CNS VHL patients (34.4 years), suggesting a lack of age association.
 CNS lesions commonly occurred in the 2nd decade of life.
 All patients at risk for VHL should be evaluated using gadolinium-enhanced MRI after 10 years of age, although ophthalmic examination should be initiated within the 1st 2 years of life.
 Enhanced MRI is particularly useful in the detection of CNS tumors in patients with the VHL gene.

69,"Ability of the c-mos product to associate with and phosphorylate tubulin.
 The mos proto-oncogene product, pp39mos, is a protein kinase and has been equated with cytostatic factor (CSF), an activity in unfertilized eggs that is thought to be responsible for the arrest of meiosis at metaphase II.
 The biochemical properties and potential substrates of pp39mos were examined in unfertilized eggs and in transformed cells in order to study how the protein functions both as CSF and in transformation.
 The pp39mos protein associated with polymers under conditions that favor tubulin oligomerization and was present in an approximately 500-kilodalton ""core"" complex under conditions that favor depolymerization.
 beta-Tubulin was preferentially coprecipitated in pp39mos immunoprecipitates and was the major phosphorylated product in a pp39mos-dependent immune complex kinase assay.
 Immunofluorescence analysis of NIH 3T3 cells transformed with Xenopus c-mos showed that pp39mos colocalizes with tubulin in the spindle during metaphase and in the midbody and asters during telophase.
 Disruption of microtubules with nocodazole affected tubulin and pp39mos organization in the same way.
 It therefore appears that pp39mos is a tubulin-associated protein kinase and may thus participate in the modification of microtubules and contribute to the formation of the spindle.
 This activity expressed during interphase in somatic cells may be responsible for the transforming activity of pp39mos.

 Light microscopy (including fluorescence microscopy) and electron microscopy were applied to a study of the photoreceptor-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) complex in a human eye which had been severely traumatised nine months prior to enucleation.
 The main feature of interest was a massive accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium at the posterior pole, and quantitative fluorescence microscopy provided values three times those obtained in appropriate control tissue.
 The photoreceptor layer was normal at the posterior pole but became progressively atrophic towards the periphery.
 The concentration of lipopofuscin was proportional to the degree of preservation of the retinal photoreceptors.
 By electron microscopy the cells in the RPE were seen to be packed with a mixture of lipofuscin granules and melanolysosomal complexes, but occasional photoreceptor phagosomes were found.
 Bruch's membrane and the choriocapillaris were normal.
 We attribute this hitherto unreported abnormality of the RPE after trauma to a dysfunction consequent on an overload of the monolayer by photoreceptor debris at the time of trauma.

 Deletion of Glu-84, Glu-83 and Glu-84, or Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu (residues 81-84) from the central helix of mammalian calmodulin is known to result in a 5-7 times decrease in its apparent in vitro affinities for three calmodulin-dependent enzymes.
 However, based on in vitro experiments, it is difficult to estimate how these deletions might affect in vivo cellular function.
 The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which requires calmodulin for growth, provides an excellent system to evaluate these deletion proteins in vivo.
 Based on its ability to restore normal growth characteristics to yeast cells, mammalian calmodulin is functionally identical to the yeast protein; herein we evaluate the effect of deleting residues 84, 83 and 84, or 81-84 from the central helix.
 Sequences encoding the deletion proteins and an unaltered control sequence were introduced by means of a yeast shuttle vector and were expressed under control of the yeast calmodulin promoter.
 The deletion and control calmodulins are produced at levels similar to that observed for the yeast protein, and they completely restore normal growth characteristics.
 This result suggests that the regions deleted from the central helix are not critical for activation of any yeast calmodulin target normally required for cell growth or division.
 It is likely that there are twisting and shortening motions associated with the deletions from the central helix that alter significantly the spatial relationship between the two lobes of calmodulin.
 The abilities of the deletion calmodulins to restore completely normal growth characteristics to yeast cells suggest that the lobes of all the deletion proteins can still be appropriately positioned in calmodulin-target complexes.
 This is consistent with the hypothesis that the central helix of calmodulin is analogous to a flexible tether rather than to a rigid connector between the two lobes of the molecule.

 Gaucher's disease is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by the defective activity of acid beta-glucosidase and the resultant accumulation of glucosyl ceramide-laden macrophages in the liver, bone, and spleen.
 Splenectomy is the preferred treatment for patients with Gaucher's disease who develop massive splenomegaly with accompanying hypersplenism and/or mechanical pressure symptoms.
 The charts of 48 patients with Gaucher's disease undergoing splenectomy at our institution between January 1963 and December 1989 were analyzed to determine the short- and long-term results of this procedure.
 Thirty-five (73%) patients had total splenectomy, whereas 13 (27%) patients had partial splenectomy.
 There was one postoperative death (after total splenectomy), and 13 patients (27%) had postoperative complications.
 Eleven patients (23%) presented with accelerated bone disease after total splenectomy (mean follow-up: 96 months).
 No patients having partial splenectomy (mean follow-up: 25 months) developed progressive bone disease.
 Eight patients have died since surgery.
 All four deaths due to malignant disease occurred in patients after total splenectomy.
 The results of this largest-ever reported series of splenectomy for Gaucher's disease confirm that while either total or partial splenectomy can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality, total splenectomy is accompanied by more aggressive bone disease and a predisposition to malignancy.
 Prospective, randomized trials are needed to substantiate whether partial splenectomy is indeed the treatment of choice for splenomegaly associated with Gaucher's disease.

 The ability of supine exercise electrocardiography and exercise radionuclide angiography to predict time to subsequent cardiac events (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or late coronary bypass grafting or angioplasty) were compared in 265 patients with normal resting electrocardiograms who were not taking digoxin.
 All patients had undergone coronary catheterization and were initially treated medically.
 Follow-up study was performed at a median of 51 months.
 Separate logistic regression models, which had been previously developed to predict 3-vessel or left main coronary artery disease (CAD), were compared using a Cox regression analysis to predict time to a subsequent cardiac event.
 The exercise electrocardiography model, consisting of the magnitude of ST depression, exercise heart rate and patient gender, was a powerful predictor (chi-square = 30.8, p less than 0.0001) of subsequent events.
 The exercise radionuclide angiography model, which included the exercise response of the pressure-volume ratio in addition to the exercise electrocardiography variables, had similar prognostic power (chi-square = 31.8, p less than 0.0001).
 In a separate analysis considering only cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction, the exercise electrocardiography model remained a significant predictor of events (chi-square = 12.2, p less than 0.001).
 None of the radionuclide angiography variables added significantly to the prognostic power of the exercise electrocardiography model.
 Thus, in patients with a normal resting electrocardiogram who are not taking digoxin, the supine exercise electrocardiography model that predicts 3-vessel or left main CAD also predicts future cardiac events.
 Exercise radionuclide angiography does not provide any additional prognostic information in such patients.

 Screw/plates were then inserted one level proximal and distal to injury, and the specimens were reloaded (fixation run).
 Radiographs were taken before and after each trial.
 Data on deformation and force histories were gathered.
 The load-deflection response of the injured and fixated specimens were bimodal with two representative stiffnesses.
 Control failure loads and stiffnesses were higher than those for the injured (P less than 0.001) or fixated (P less than 0.01) spine.
 Initial stiffness was significantly higher for the fixated than for injured columns (P less than 0.001), but the final stiffnesses were similar.
 The increase in the initial stiffness in the fixated specimen compared to the injured specimen indicates the strength added to the posterior region of the spine.
 The relatively smaller alteration in the final stiffness between the fixated and the injured columns, corresponding to the load shared by the anterior column, may suggest that, above a critical strain level, the anterior column absorbs a higher portion of the external load and posterior fixation may be inadequate as sole treatment in trauma.

82,"Murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody as a potential network antigen for human carcinoembryonic antigen.
 Carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract are not curable by standard therapies.
 Thus, new therapeutic approaches for this disease are needed.
 This study proposes the use of anti-Id mAb as Ag substitutes to induce anti-tumor immunity in gastrointestinal cancer patients.
 Recently, we have generated and characterized one monoclonal anti-Id antibody, designated 3H1 (Ab2), which mimics biologically and antigenically a distinct and specific epitope of the 180,000 m.w.
 carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) primarily expressed in high density by human pancreatic and colonic tumor cells.
 This epitope is unique to CEA and not present on other CEA-related lower m.w.
 members of the Ag family also found on normal tissues.
 The antigenic determinant as defined by the mAb 8019 (Ab1) against which the Ab2, 3H1 was raised, is absent on normal adult tissues by immunoperoxidase staining and haematopoietic cells including granulocytes by flow cytometry analysis.
 Anti-Id (Ab2) 3H1 induced CEA-specific antibodies in mice and rabbits.
 The immune sera from both mice and rabbits competed with Ab1 for binding to the colon carcinoma cell line LS174T and inhibited the binding of radioiodinated Ab1 to Ab2.
 This indicates that anti-anti-Id (Ab3) in mice and rabbits share idiotopes with Ab1 (8019).
 Furthermore, monoclonal Ab3 that bind to CEA have been generated from mice immunized with 3H1.
 The Ab3 (both polyclonal as well as monoclonal) immunoprecipitated the same 180,000 m.w.
 CEA as Ab1 (8019) by Western blotting analysis and showed almost identical immuno-staining patterns as Ab1 on colonic adenocarcinoma tissue sections from several patients.
 Collectively these data suggest that Ab2 3H1 could potentially be used clinically as a network Ag for immunotherapy of patients with CEA positive tumors.

83,"Prognostic factors in primary retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas.
 We analyzed independent treatment variables (age, sex, signs and symptoms, site, size, histopathologic findings, grade, and clinical presentation) and treatment-dependent variables (resectability, type of operation, surgical margins, surgical boundaries, microscopic margins, adjuvant radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy) in 80 patients with primary retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas admitted from 1982 through 1988.
 Both univariate and multivariate analysis of survival and disease-free survival were performed.
 The major factor in survival outcome was the ability to completely resect the lesion.
 When the 62 patients who underwent complete resection were examined, the only independent prognostic factor for both survival and disease-free survival was grade.
 We conclude that completeness of resection and grade of the lesion are primary determinants of survival.
 Once all tumor is macroscopically removed, no advantage could be demonstrated by more extensive surgical resection or current adjuvant therapy.

 We studied the metabolism of 3H-platelet activating factor (PAF) and lyso-PAF in human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) from severely burned patients (n = 6) on days 1, 5, 9, 15, and 25 post-trauma.
 All patients suffered from a severe burn trauma of more than 30% total body surface area.
 Stimulation of PMN in healthy donors (n = 10) with the Ca-ionophore resulted in the conversion of 3H-lyso-PAF into PAF (18 +/- 2% of total radioactivity) and alkyl-acyl-glycero-phosphorylcholine (alkyl-acyl-GPC, 50 +/- 6%).
 In burned patients a significantly reduced formation of 3H-PAF was observed between days 1 and 15 post-trauma (day 9: 1 +/- 1%, p less than 0.0001).
 This pattern was normalized again in patients (n = 5) who survived the trauma after septic periods and was observed during the second week post-trauma.
 In one patient who succumbed to his injuries a sustained inhibition of PAF formation was observed up to his death.
 The decreased formation of PAF correlated weakly with the appearance of immature granulocytes within the analyzed cell fraction (ratio of immature cells versus PAF-formation, r = -0.55, p = 0.02).

85,"Differences in QRS configuration during unipolar pacing from adjacent sites: implications for the spatial resolution of pace-mapping.
 To examine the spatial resolution of unipolar pace-mapping, 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) recorded during pacing from each of the poles of a quadripolar catheter (5 mm interelectrode distance) were examined.
 Unipolar pacing was performed from each of the poles at late diastolic threshold, twice threshold and 10 mA at a cycle length of 500 ms.
 In 15 patients, pacing was performed at the right ventricular apex and in 14 at various left ventricular sites.
 Pacing from the distal catheter pole at threshold (index ECG) was used to simulate the site of origin of ventricular tachycardia, and all other ECGs were compared with the index ECG.
 Electrocardiograms were evaluated by two independent observers for 1) minor configuration differences (notch, new small component, change in the amplitude of individual components or change in QRS shape); 2) major differences in configuration (new large component, marked change in the amplitude of an existing component or two minor changes); and 3) peak to peak changes in amplitude.
 Minor differences in configuration were seen in a mean 2.4 +/- 1.9, 4.6 +/- 2.4 and 4.4 +/- 2.9 leads during pacing at 5, 10 and 15 mm from the distal electrode (index site).
 Major differences in configuration were seen in a mean of 0.3 +/- 0.5, 2.1 +/- 2.1 and 3.7 +/- 2.3 leads during pacing at 5, 10 and 15 mm from the index site.
 Differences in amplitude were seen in a mean of 3.1 +/- 2.2, 5.6 +/- 2.5 and 6.8 +/- 3.0 leads per ECG during pacing at 5, 10 and 15 mm from the index ECG pacing site, respectively.

 The authors describe the use of a new ultrasound (US)-aspiration thrombectomy technique.
 An oscillating US probe was inserted into a thin-walled, large-bore aspiration catheter.
 Experiments tested the ability of the new device and other catheter combinations to remove clot material from a Petri dish, as well as from small and large vessel models made of silicone and glass tubes, respectively.
 Results of the experiments demonstrated that an oscillating 1.0-mm US probe inserted into an aspiration catheter (7-9 F in diameter) promoted clot fragmentation and allowed continuous aspiration of thrombi of any size.
 When compared with simple large-bore catheter aspiration and with mechanical fragmentation by means of a US probe within a catheter that was flushed to cool the probe, US-assisted aspiration thrombectomy demonstrated significantly better results for percutaneous transcatheter removal of fresh thrombi.

 mortality.
 Connecticut mortality and Connecticut incidence.
 Birth cohort patterns were evident for all three sets of data.
 The results confirm a continuing increase in invasive breast cancer by providing evidence of a strong birth cohort pattern, over a time series of 90 years of birth cohorts.
 This trend appears to be real for the most part because of the cohort patterns and because there is minimal underdetection in data obtained by autopsy and blind biopsy.
 Secondly, when cohort modeling is applied to breast cancer mortality, there is an indication of a modest decline in recent breast cancer mortality (in the face of an apparent long-term increase), which suggests that control of breast cancer mortality may have developed in recent decades, perhaps through earlier detection and improved treatment.
 Finally, in contrast with a prior report, there is little evidence for a clinically important difference in time trend between pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer.

 In an effort to critically define the incidence and clinical characteristics of secondary responses to cisplatin-based therapy in patients with ovarian cancer previously treated with a cisplatin-based program, a retrospective review was undertaken of patients at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center who received greater than or equal to two cisplatin/carboplatin-based programs.
 Eighty-two patients were identified who met the entry criteria of having had a cisplatin-free interval (CFI) of more than 4 months between the completion of their first regimen and the institution of a second cisplatin/carboplatin program.
 Of the 72 assessable patients (10 had no measurable disease, and a laparotomy was not performed to assess response), 31 (43%) responded, including 10 surgically defined complete responses (S-CRs).
 The overall response rates (and S-CR rate), based on duration of CFI, were 5 to 12 months, 27% (5%); 13 to 24 months, 33% (11%); and more than 24 months, 59% (22%).
 Twenty-nine patients (35%) received noncisplatin/carboplatin-containing treatments between the cisplatin programs.
 Patients without any treatment for more than 24 months from the completion of their initial therapy experienced a 77% (17 of 22) response rate and a 32% (seven of 22) S-CR rate.
 In conclusion, secondary responses to cisplatin/carboplatin-based treatment are common in patients with ovarian cancer who have previously responded to the agents and increase in frequency with greater distance from the initial therapy.

 OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the regular elicitation of the relaxation response produces sustained physiologic changes coincident with symptomatic relief or improved psychological state.
 DESIGN: Prospective, cohort pilot study.
 SETTING: Clinical research center within a teaching hospital.
 PATIENTS: Thirteen athletic men, mean age 44.8 years, with borderline or labile hypertension, taking no medication.
 All 13 completed the study.
 INTERVENTIONS: Three baseline assessments of psychological state, symptom checklist, and assessment of autonomic response to infusion of beta agonist (isoproterenol).
 Daily relaxation response exercises for five consecutive weeks followed by repeat assessment of all parameters.
 Discontinuation of relaxation exercises for subsequent five weeks followed by repeat assessment of all parameters.
 Measurements and main results: After eliciting the relaxation response, subjects demonstrated significant decreases in anxiety (p less than 0.014) and somatic symptoms (p less than 0.02).
 Psychological and somatic variables returned toward baseline after the subsequent discontinuation of relaxation exercises.
 No significant concomitant change in urinary catecholamines, heart rate response to isoproterenol, blood pressure, pulse rate, or serum cholesterol was demonstrated.
 CONCLUSION: The regular elicitation of the relaxation response can improve psychological performance and reduce symptoms.
 However, the physiologic mechanism whereby these psychological and symptomatic improvements occur remains poorly understood and warrants further investigation.

91,"Frequent mutation of the p53 gene in human esophageal cancer.
 Sequence alterations in the p53 gene have been detected in human tumors of the brain, breast, lung, and colon, and it has been proposed that p53 mutations spanning a major portion of the coding region inactivate the tumor suppressor function of this gene.
 To our knowledge, neither transforming mutations in oncogenes nor mutations in tumor suppressor genes have been reported in human esophageal tumors.
 We examined four human esophageal carcinoma cell lines and 14 human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing for the presence of p53 mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
 Two cell lines and five of the tumor specimens contained a mutated allele (one frameshift and six missense mutations).
 All missense mutations detected occurred at G.C base pairs in codons at or adjacent to mutations previously reported in other cancers.
 The identification of aberrant p53 gene alleles in one-third of the tumors we tested suggests that mutations at this locus are common genetic events in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus.

 The efficacy of specialist versus general practitioner (GP) treatment of problem drinkers was assessed in a randomised controlled trial.
 40 problem drinkers referred consecutively to a specialist alcohol clinic by their GP were, after assessment, randomly allocated to either GP or specialist clinic treatment groups.
 All subjects received initial advice and counselling in the clinic about their drinking.
 The specialist clinic group received continued care from the clinic including, if necessary, admission to hospital.
 Patients in the GP group were returned to the care of the GP who was contacted and supported by the specialist.
 After 6 months of follow-up, there were significant reductions in alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems in both groups.
 No significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to the main outcome measures.
 No differential treatment effect was found with the more severely dependent drinkers.
 The findings show that after an initial detailed assessment and advice session, the treatment provided by GPs is at least as effective as that from a specialist clinic with respect to improvements in drinking behaviour and alcohol-related problems.
 After initial assessment and advice, specialist clinics should encourage GPs to become more involved in the subsequent care of problem drinkers.
 Such a practice should be based on the individual patient's needs and the adequacy of support offered to GPs.

 Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.3 mg/kg, fentanyl and pancuronium, and maintained with midazolam as a continuous infusion, fentanyl, pancuronium and nitrous oxide in oxygen or oxygen in air.
 The concentration of midazolam in the blood of 10 patients was about 300 ng/litre during two measurements; the patients' lungs were ventilated with N2O in oxygen.
 The concentration of midazolam in the blood of another 10 patients was doubled to about 600 ng/litre during the second flow measurement; the patients' lungs were ventilated with N2O/O2.

 To determine whether patients at risk for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation could be detected while in sinus rhythm, the signal-averaged electrocardiogram triggered by P waves was recorded in 42 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (Paf group) and in 50 control patients.
 The root mean square voltages (LP10, LP20, and LP30) for the last 10, 20, and 30 msec and the duration (Ad) of filtered (40-300 Hz) P wave of the spatial magnitude were measured.
 LP10 and LP20 were significantly lower in the Paf than in the control group (LP10, 1.92 +/- 0.58 versus 2.49 +/- 0.78 microV, p less than 0.001; LP20, 2.47 +/- 0.78 versus 3.46 +/- 1.20 microV, p less than 0.0001), although no significant difference in LP30 was found between groups.
 Ad was also significantly longer in the Paf than in the control group (137.0 +/- 14.3 versus 118.6 +/- 11.3 msec, p less than 0.001).
 These differences between the Paf and control groups remained significant even after dividing by the presence or absence of organic heart diseases.
 The criteria of ""LP20 = 3.5 microV or less"" and ""Ad greater than 120 msec"" as defining ""atrial late potential"" gave a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 76%.

 The diameters of both radial arteries and the temporal artery on the non-painful side were smaller during than between attacks.
 The generalised vasoconstriction was not shared by the temporal artery on the affected side, which suggests a local vasodilatory response.

 We previously reported antigen frequency differences for HLA-DR4 and HLA-DRw6 between idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) patients and healthy controls in a pilot study.
 To confirm these findings, we undertook an independent study with a prospective hypothesis regarding the frequencies of DR4 and DRw6; typing for a second family of class II antigens (HLA-DQ) was included because of the proximity of the DQ loci to the DR loci and the strong linkage disequilibrium between some of the DR and DQ alleles.
 Comparing a new consecutive series of IDC patients (n = 41) and healthy blood bank controls (n = 53), we confirmed an increase of DR4 antigen frequency in patients (49% versus 21%, p less than 0.005).
 A trend toward decreased expression of DRw6 among patients was also noted (10% of patients versus 23% of controls).
 HLA-DQw4 was significantly elevated in patients compared with controls (27% versus 6%, p less than 0.005; relative risk, 6.1; etiologic fraction, 0.22).
 We identified the combined DR4-DQw4 haplotype in five of 41 Caucasian IDC patients (12%) and none of 53 controls (p less than 0.007).
 A comparison of specific antigen frequencies between the preliminary and validation studies did not reveal significant differences; therefore, the data from the two studies were examined in combination.
 For the combined studies, DR4 was elevated (51% versus 27% in controls, p less than 0.001), and DRw6 was decreased (9% versus 24% in controls, p less than 0.01).

 Cardiovascular risk factors can be substantially modified by changes in life-style such as diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and moderation of alcohol consumption.
 In turn, these can reduce blood pressure, heart rate at rest, and blood lipid concentrations.
 Epidemiologic evidence shows that for every 1% change in serum cholesterol levels, there is a 3% change in the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease.
 In addition, a long-term (5-year) change of 5 to 6 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure can reduce the chances of stroke by 35 to 40% and of coronary heart disease by 20 to 25%.

 Clinical and histopathologic features are often inadequate for accurate prediction of relapse or survival of individual patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS).
 We therefore studied the cellular DNA content (ploidy) of RMS cells in relation to histology and response to therapy in 37 patients with unresectable tumors.
 Using flow cytometric techniques, we found that about one third of patients had diploid tumor stem lines, regardless of the histologic subtype.
 In the group with abnormal ploidy, a hyperdiploid classification (1.10 to 1.80 times the DNA content of normal diploid cells) was exclusively associated with embryonal histology (P = .001).
 By contrast, near-tetraploidy (1.80 to 2.60 times the DNA content of normal cells) was strongly associated with alveolar histology (P = .001).
 Thus, in these histologic subtypes of RMS, abnormal ploidy appears to arise through different mechanisms.
 Tumor-cell ploidy had a significant impact on survival that was especially apparent in patients with unresectable, nonmetastatic (group III) tumors.
 In this subgroup, hyperdiploidy conferred the best prognosis and diploidy the worst (P less than .0001).
 None of the eight patients with diploid tumors survived for more than 18 months.
 Tumor-cell ploidy was the best predictor of treatment outcome for patients with either embryonal (P less than .001; relative risk, 25.5) or alveolar (P = .073; relative risk 7.1) RMS and contributed significantly after adjustment for disease stage and anatomic site.
 Patients with unresectable diploid RMS have an unacceptably high risk of treatment failure, justifying new therapeutic approaches for this distinct subgroup.

110,"Neurobehavioral effects of phenytoin prophylaxis of posttraumatic seizures 
 In order to determine potential negative neurobehavioral effects of phenytoin given to prevent the development of posttraumatic seizures, 244 subjects were randomized to phenytoin or placebo.
 They received neurobehavioral assessments at 1 and 12 months postinjury while receiving their assigned drug and at 24 months while receiving no drugs.
 In the severely injured, phenytoin significantly impaired performance at 1 month.
 No significant differences were found as a function of phenytoin in the moderately injured patients at 1 month or in either severity group at 1 year.
 Patients who stopped receiving phenytoin according to protocol between 1 and 2 years improved more than corresponding placebo cases on several measures.
 We conclude that phenytoin has negative cognitive effects.
 This, combined with lack of evidence for its effectiveness in preventing posttraumatic seizures beyond the first week, raises questions regarding its use for long-term prophylaxis.
 Our findings do not negate phenytoin's proven efficacy in controlling established seizures nor do they indicate that its cognitive effects are worse than other anticonvulsant drugs.

111,"Characterization of LY233569 on 5-lipoxygenase and reperfusion injury of ischemic myocardium.
 LY233569 produced concentration-dependent inhibition of isolated guinea pig 5-lipoxygenase (5-LPO) and 5-LPO activity of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro; IC50 values were 0.4 and 0.1 microM, respectively.
 LY233569 also inhibited (IC50 approximately 1.8 microM) zymosan-stimulated production of leukotriene B4 in canine whole blood but had little or no concomitant effect on the production of thromboxane B2.
 Concentrations of LY233569 as high as 10 microM did not inhibit production or scavenge superoxide from activated human neutrophils.
 In normal anesthetized dogs, infusion of LY233569 (0.11 mg/kg/min, i.v.) for 6 hr produced persistent inhibition (approximately 80%) of leukotriene B4 production in blood challenged ex vivo with zymosan; the plasma concentration (approximately 4 microM) of LY233569 was consistent with in vitro data illustrating selective and maximal inhibition of 5-LPO.
 In subsequent experiments, myocardial infarct size was measured after 1 hr of occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery and 5 hr of reperfusion.
 Continuous infusion of LY233569 (0.11 mg/kg/min, i.v.) had little or no effect on base-line systolic arterial pressure, cardiac rate and the pressure rate product when compared with time-related changes observed in control dogs.
 LY233569 infusion also did not alter the degree of ST-segment deviation or the intensity and duration of cardiac arrhythmias associated with coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion.
 Resultant myocardial infarct sizes were 45 +/- 5% of the left ventricle placed at risk in control dogs and 43 +/- 4% in dogs given LY233569.
 Myeloperoxidase activity of infarcted myocardium did not differ between groups.

112,"Tourette syndrome: recent advances.
 Clinical and genetic studies have allowed the limits of Tourette syndrome to be broadened.
 There is now strong evidence that chronic motor tics and Tourette syndrome are different manifestations of an autosomal dominant gene with high penetrance.
 A genetic link with obsessive-compulsive disorder also appears to have been established.
 Up to 10% of cases of Tourette syndrome may be nongenetic phenocopies, however.
 There is also an association between Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
 This complicates therapy, as psychostimulant drugs may precipitate or exacerbate tics in some individuals.
 A high proportion of patients with Tourette syndrome also has neuropsychological deficits and learning disabilities.
 The pathophysiology is incompletely understood.
 The best supported hypothesis is that there is dopamine receptor supersensitivity, although there are strong suggestions of abnormalities in serotonin metabolism.
 The possibility of abnormalities in neuropeptide systems is being explored.
 Treatment of tics relies primarily on neuroleptics with dopamine receptor blocking activity.
 Clonidine may be useful in some patients, especially those with behavior problems.
 Obsessive-compulsive symptoms can be treated using appropriate pharmacologic agents.
 The treatment of attention deficit disorder in patients with tics should begin with behavioral strategies.
 Clonidine can be tried as the first-line drug, and psychostimulants should be used only if necessary and with great caution.
 In rare instances it may be necessary to combine a psychostimulant and a neuroleptic.

 A survey of the University of Connecticut Oral Pathology Biopsy Service was undertaken to analyze cases of oral cancer accessioned during the 12-year period, 1975 through 1986 inclusive.
 Of 33,429 total specimens accessioned, there were 546 malignant oral neoplasms diagnosed and reported.
 Sixty-five (11.5%) originated from out of state.
 Invasive intraoral squamous cell carcinoma was the predominant tumor (69.7% of total), whereas lip cancer constituted only 2.8% of all malignancies.
 Minor salivary gland adenocarcinomas accounted for 11% of total malignancies whereas verrucous carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, and miscellaneous other forms of oral cancer accounted for the remainder (4.6%, 5.3%, and 6.6%, respectively).
 Cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma were further analyzed by year, sex distribution, location subsite, age at diagnosis, and histologic grade.
 With the exception of histologic grading, we found that the characterization of cases of squamous cell carcinoma within the biopsy service tended to parallel results from a separate but related statewide analysis of both oral cancer and intraoral squamous cell carcinoma from Connecticut over a much longer time span.
 We concluded that the picture of oral cancer as characterized by cases within the University of Connecticut Oral Pathology Biopsy Service is generally reflective of the disease on a statewide level.

114,"Lidocaine potentiation of cocaine toxicity.
 STUDY HYPOTHESIS: The toxic effects of cocaine are enhanced in the presence of lidocaine.
 STUDY POPULATION: Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 to 300 g.
 METHODS: Animals received intraperitoneal injections of cocaine (10, 20, 35, or 50 mg/kg), lidocaine (30 or 40 mg/kg), or a combination of all doses of cocaine given simultaneously with 30 or 40 mg/kg lidocaine.
 The incidence and time to seizure and death were recorded in these groups and compared by chi 2 and analysis of variance analyses, respectively.
 RESULTS: At doses of 30 or 40 mg/kg, lidocaine does not induce seizures or death.
 The effect of simultaneous injection of both cocaine and lidocaine was to dramatically increase the incidence of both seizures and death over that of cocaine alone.
 The incidence of seizures in animals receiving 35 mg/kg cocaine alone was 10%; this increased to 50% and 80% with the addition of 30 and 40 mg/kg lidocaine, respectively (P less than or equal to .05; P less than or equal to .01).
 Death did not occur in animals receiving 35 mg/kg cocaine alone; the addition of 30 and 40 mg/kg lidocaine resulted in death in 30% and 60% of animals, respectively (P less than or equal to .01 each group).
 Similarly, in rats receiving 50 mg/kg cocaine, the incidence of death increased from 0% to 60% and 80% with 30 and 40 mg/kg lidocaine, respectively (P less than or equal to .01).
 CONCLUSION: In the rat, overall toxicity of cocaine is significantly increased with simultaneous exposure to lidocaine.

115,"Factors predicting satisfactory home care after stroke.
 This study prospectively investigated factors predicting optimal poststroke home care.
 One hundred and thirty-five first occurrence stroke patients and their primary support persons were evaluated during the initial hospitalization after stroke and again one year poststroke.
 Discriminant function analysis was used to identify two groups from the baseline data: home care situations which were rated optimal and those which were not.
 Group membership was predicted and validated with 72.6% accuracy.
 Patients at risk for less than optimal home care had caregivers who were (1) more likely to be depressed, (2) less likely to be married to the patient, (3) below average in knowledge about stroke care, and (4) reporting more family dysfunction.
 Our findings suggest that caregiver-related problems can have a collective effect on rehabilitation outcome and that treatment should reduce caregiver depression, minimize family dysfunction, and increase the family's knowledge about stroke care.

116,"Reducing unnecessary coronary care unit admissions: a comparison of three decision aids 
 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether published decision rules for ischemic heart disease have practical value in reducing unnecessary admissions to coronary care units.
 DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
 SETTING: A community hospital emergency room.
 PATIENTS: 235 consecutive patients presenting to an emergency room with a chief complaint of chest pain.
 MEASUREMENTS: Clinical information, including observations needed to use previously published decision aids, was collected on special forms at the time of the emergency room visit.
 Follow-up information was obtained from the medical records of patients who were admitted and by telephone interviews with patients who were discharged.
 The authors compared the residents' actual decisions with the predictions of the decision aids regarding their ability to predict complications (that is, to identify patients who needed admission or intensive care).
 MAIN RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: None of the decision aids could reduce unnecessary admissions without seriously increasing the rate of inappropriate discharges.
 However, within the clinically relevant subgroup of patients for whom the decision to admit or discharge was not obvious on clinical grounds (those without complications on presentation whom the residents chose not to discharge), the decision aids examined, used in combination to verify the need for admission, might have safely averted some unnecessary admissions.

 In a double-blind, cross-over trial, progabide (PGB) and placebo were compared as add-on therapy in 59 patients with moderate to severe epilepsy.
 Eight patients did not complete the study, 4 because of adverse drug reactions (elevation of liver transaminases, 2; gastritis, 1; and acute psychosis, 1) and 4 because of administrative reasons.
 Among the remaining 51 patients, seizure frequency was reduced greater than 50% in 18 patients with PGB treatment and in 8 patients with placebo (p less than 0.05).
 The number of days with seizures was significantly (p = 0.034) reduced during PGB treatment.
 Both patients' and physicians' preferences at the end of the trial were in favor (p less than 0.01) of PGB.
 Mild clinical side effects were present in 54.7% of the patients treated with PGB and in 37.7% with placebo.
 Increase in liver transaminases was observed in 2 patients during the double-blind study and in 1 during the follow-up period.
 Our data show that PGB, as previously reported, is useful in 30-40% of patients who are not responding completely to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

 Three corresponding groups of control rats were injected with saline.
 In Group 1, maximum load and stiffness of the healing fractures increased to 165% and 175%, respectively, compared to the control group.
 In Group 2, maximum load, stiffness, maximum stress, and energy absorption at maximum load increased to 222%, 175%, 171%, and 247%, respectively, compared to the control group.
 In Group 3, no statistically detectable effects were found.

119,"Catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation. Incidence and clinical significance.
 The incidence and severity of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation has not been studied extensively.
 Given the frequency with which right heart catheters are employed to measure cardiac output, it is important to know whether the severity of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation is sufficient to invalidate the measurement of thermodilution cardiac output.
 Accordingly, the purpose of the present prospective study was to determine the incidence and severity of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation in 25 men (mean age, 58.1 +/- 1.4 years) using Doppler ultrasound.
 The tricuspid valve was interrogated from two orthogonal views using pulsed-wave and color flow Doppler, either in the presence or absence of a 7-French catheter across the tricuspid valve.
 The severity of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation was graded semiquantitatively using a validated scoring system.
 Pulsed-wave Doppler studies showed that the incidence of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation was 48 percent, and that the average tricuspid regurgitation score increased from 0.41 +/- 0.16 to 0.61 +/- 0.17 (p less than 0.01).
 Color flow Doppler studies showed similar findings.
 Further, the incidence of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation was not related to the patient's underlying hemodynamic status or right ventricular geometry.
 In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that the quantitative extent of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation is small, and is therefore unlikely to be important clinically, particularly with regard to the assessment of thermodilution cardiac output.

 An assessment system for the prognosis of metastatic spine tumors was evaluated for 64 cases who had undergone surgery.
 Six parameters were employed in the assessment system: 1) the general condition, 2) the number of extraspinal bone metastases, 3) the number of metastases in the vertebral body, 4) metastases to the major internal organs (lungs, liver, kidneys, and brain), 5) the primary site of the cancer, and 6) the severity of spinal cord palsy.
 Each parameter ranged from 0 to 2 points.
 The total score obtained for each patient can be correlated with the prognosis, while being valuable in predicting it.
 However, the prognosis could not be predicted from a single parameter.
 In conclusion, an excisional operation should be performed on those cases who scored above 9 points, while a palliative operation is indicated for those who scored under 5 points.

 This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and toleration of once-daily doxazosin in the treatment of essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure 95 to 115 mm Hg) in a general medical practice.
 Fifty-three patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension entered a study of 14 weeks' duration.
 This consisted of a baseline run-in period of 2 weeks, a dose-adjustment phase with doxazosin (8 weeks), and a maintenance phase of 4 weeks.
 Doxazosin was initiated at 1 mg/day, and every 2 weeks the dose was doubled unless blood pressure was normalized (sitting diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg with greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg reduction from baseline) or significant side effects emerged.
 The maximum daily dose administered was 8 mg.
 Doxazosin produced a significant (p less than 0.05) final mean change in sitting blood pressure of -17.4/-12.2 mm Hg at a final mean daily dose of 4.1 mg.

124,"Dorsal rhizotomy for children with cerebral palsy: support for concepts of motor control.
 The results from selective dorsal rhizotomy research suggest that therapists need to question some common clinical assumptions about movement dysfunction.
 The rationale for performing a selective dorsal rhizotomy is based on the clinical assumptions that spasticity is the underlying cause of disordered movement and that reducing or eliminating the spasticity will improve movement.
 This article reviews the literature related to movement dysfunction, the effects of selective dorsal rhizotomy, and the evidence for disordered motor control in children with spastic cerebral palsy.
 Selective dorsal rhizotomy appears to reduce spasticity and increase joint range of motion.
 Abnormal movement patterns, however, persist after the spasticity is reduced.
 Well-coordinated movement patterns are acquired slowly and appear to be related to an intense period of physical therapy.
 I argue that these results provide evidence that the presence of spasticity alone is an insufficient explanation for abnormal movement patterns.
 I propose that physical therapists redirect their efforts from developing methods for reducing spasticity to developing adequate assessment, treatment, and measurement techniques for assessing motor control in children with cerebral palsy.
 I believe we can maximize the functional potential of children with cerebral palsy by identifying problems related to motor control and applying sound principles of motor learning to treatment.

 We measured systemic to pulmonary bronchial blood flow [Qbr(s-p)] during total cardiopulmonary bypass in 15 patients with mitral stenosis and elevated pulmonary venous pressure (group A, mean pulmonary wedge pressure = 22.2 +/- 5.4 mm Hg, mean +/- SD) and in 15 patients with coronary artery diseases and normal pulmonary venous pressure (group B).
 Qbr(s-p) is the volume of blood accumulating in the left side of the heart in the absence of pulmonary and coronary flows.
 This blood was vented through a cannula introduced into the left atrium and measured.
 Qbr(s-p) was 76.3 +/- 13.9 ml/min (2.18 +/- 0.37 percent of extracorporeal circulation pump flow) and 22.3 +/- 2.1 (0.63 +/- 0.15) in group A and B, respectively (p less than 0.01).
 During total cardiopulmonary bypass, pulmonary venous pressure is approximately atmospheric pressure, and no differences in systemic blood pressure, extracorporeal circulation pump flow, and airways pressure were observed between group A and B.
 Therefore, vascular resistance through the bronchial vessels draining into the pulmonary circulation is reduced in patients with mitral stenosis and elevated pulmonary venous pressure.

 In a sample of 298 cocaine abusers seeking inpatient (n = 149) or outpatient (n = 149) treatment, rates of psychiatric disorders were determined by means of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Research Diagnostic Criteria.
 Overall, 55.7% met current and 73.5% met lifetime criteria for a psychiatric disorder other than a substance use disorder.
 In common with previous reports from clinical samples of cocaine abusers, these overall rates were largely accounted for by major depression, minor bipolar conditions (eg, hypomania, cyclothymic personality), anxiety disorders, antisocial personality, and history of childhood attention deficit disorder.
 Affective disorders and alcoholism usually followed the onset of drug abuse, while anxiety disorders, antisocial personality, and attention deficit disorder typically preceded drug abuse.

 Homogeneity of variance tests revealed that lipid variances were gender and/or generation specific while apolipoprotein variances were homogeneous across strata.
 In the absence of heterogeneity of variance, significant heterogeneity in LDL:lnTrig and lnTrig:Apo AII covariation was found between genders in the parental generation.
 In the presence of heterogeneity of variance, significant heterogeneity of correlation between genders and/or across generations was found for the HDL-C:LDL-C, Total-C:LDL-C, Total-C:lnTrig, lnTrig:LDL-C, Total-C:lnApo E and HDL-C:lnApo E bivariate distributions.
 Analyses of principal components revealed that the generation and gender specific cohorts have similar eigenvalues but distinct eigenvectors for the first two principal components underlying the seven dimensional lipid and apolipoprotein distribution.
 We conclude that the amount of variability explained by the first two principal components is the same across cohorts but how the interindividual variability is distributed among the lipid and apolipoprotein traits is generation and gender specific.
 This study documents the role that variance and covariance might play in determining risk of disease for special subgroups of the population at large.
 It also demonstrates how variances and covariances between risk factors traits characterize life processes of aging and sexual dimorphism.
 This study argues that future biometrical genetic and epidemiological studies of coronary artery disease must take into account age and gender effects on interindividual variability and covariability of risk factors.

 These data are in agreement with our previous observations, showing that the VH chain of mAb383 is encoded by an extensive somatically mutated VHV gene in a way that is consistent with an Ag-driven immune response.

 Cerebral vascular malformations have traditionally been divided into four categories: arteriovenous, venous, cavernous, and capillary telangiectases.
 A controversy exists about separating the latter two lesions into separate entities.
 Critics claim the distinction is arbitrary but have been unable to present convincing evidence linking the two types of lesions.

 family with cerebral amyloid and spongiform encephalopathy--the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome.
 All the inoculated marmosets developed spongiform encephalopathy (SE) after incubation times of 20-23 months in the CJD group and 25-32 months in the GSS group.
 Subsequent passage from 1 affected animal in each group resulted in SE developing after 17 months incubation.
 In every animal inoculated with CJD or GSS material and in the 2 passage experiments the most severely affected region of the brain was the thalamus which in all cases was almost totally occupied by vacuoles.
 Other grey matter masses were less severely and less consistently affected.
 Vacuolation was observed in the cerebellar granule cell layer as well as in the molecular layer and the brain stem was finely vacuolated in all cases.
 There were only minor and inconsistent differences between the disease transmitted from CJD compared with GSS and some differences between the original transmissions and the SE caused by passaged inocula.
 Severe astrocytic gliosis accompanied the spongiform changes but no amyloid was identified in any of the marmosets with experimentally transmitted disease.
 The pathogenesis of the spongiform change in the thalamus was studied in a series of marmosets by light and electron microscopy 3-22 months after the intracerebral inoculation of CJD or GSS homogenates and was compared with controls.
 Dilated irregularly-shaped cisternae and the large complex vacuoles typical of SE, present in abundance after 18 and 22 months incubation, were considered most probably to be derived from cisternae of neuronal smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

 Patient ages ranged from 5 to 78 years.
 There were 38 Class I, 70 Class II, 48 Class III, four Class IV, and four Class V injuries.
 Injury mechanism was penetrating in 102 (62%) patients and blunt in 62.

 In summary, this analysis demonstrated: 1) the great majority of duodenal injuries can be managed by simple repair; 2) tube duodenostomy is not a mandatory component of operative treatment; 3) pyloric exclusion is a useful adjunct for more complex injuries; 4) pancreatoduodenectomy is rarely necessary for civilian duodenal trauma; 5) morbidity following duodenal trauma is more dependent on associated intra-abdominal injuries than the extent of duodenal trauma; and 6) mortality following duodenal injuries is primarily related to associated vascular and hepatic trauma.

137,"Intraoperative I-125 seed implantation for extensive recurrent head and neck carcinomas.
 From 1978 to 1988, 41 patients with extensive recurrent carcinomas of the head and neck were treated with surgical resection plus intraoperative iodine-125 seed implantation.
 Surgery was performed to resect the tumors and to expose the tumor beds for implantation.
 I-125 seeds were implanted intraoperatively, with a spacing of 0.75-1 cm between adjacent seeds, either into the soft tissue in the tumor bed or onto small patches of gelatin sponges to cover the bone, nerve, or blood vessel involved with disease.
 Reconstructive flaps were used in 18 patients.
 The average I-125 dose delivered by the implanted seeds was 8,263 cGy.
 The determinate 5-year actuarial survival rate for the entire group was 40%.
 The 5-year local disease control rate was 44%.
 Major complications were transient wound infection (32%), flap necrosis (24%), fistula formation (10%), and carotid blowout (5%).
 These results indicate that surgical resection plus I-125 seed implantation provides a potentially curative treatment for patients with extensive recurrent head and neck carcinomas that would be considered traditionally unresectable and that would be treated only with palliative therapy.

138,"The pattern of intrathoracic Hodgkin's disease assessed by computed tomography.
 Computed tomography (CT) was used to define the sites of intrathoracic abnormality in Hodgkin's disease, determine a pattern of progression of disease in the thorax, and establish the place of this pattern of spread in the differential diagnosis of thoracic abnormalities.
 One hundred eight patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease were studied by chest CT.
 Seventy-seven patients had intrathoracic abnormalities.
 The pattern seen was one of contiguous spread from the anterior mediastinal/paratracheal area to the other mediastinal lymph node groups (aortopulmonary, subcarinal, posterior mediastinal, and internal mammary), to the hila, and then into the lung by extension or as discrete nodules.
 Involvement of the pleura, pericardium, or chest wall occurred only after the anterior mediastinal/paratracheal mass had enlarged to greater than 30% of the thoracic diameter.
 The probability that this pattern of contiguous lymph node spread occurred by chance alone was very small.
 Hodgkin's disease spreads from the anterior mediastinal/paratracheal area in a contiguous manner.
 Exceptions are unusual enough that when they occur, diagnoses other than Hodgkin's disease are more likely.

 Twenty-four hearts in which both great arteries arose from the right ventricle were studied to establish variations present within the fibrous skeleton and infundibular morphologies.
 Variations were also noted in the location of the ventricular septal defect and measurements were obtained of the outlet septum and the circumferences of the arterial valves.
 Completely muscular subarterial infundibulums were present in only 9 (37.5%) of the hearts, with varying degrees of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the arterial and atrioventricular valves in the remainder.
 The aorta was rightward and posterior in 12 (50%) of the hearts, and subaortic and subpulmonary ventricular septal defects were present in equal numbers in this group.
 No subaortic defects were present when the aorta was side-by-side and right-sided.
 No subpulmonary defects were present in hearts with a posterior aorta.
 The mean ratio of 0.91 +/- 0.36 for the subpulmonary to subaortic length of the outlet septum was significantly less than the value of 1.54 +/- 0.41 noted previously in hearts with tetralogy of Fallot (p less than 0.001).

 Treatment of complex cerebrovascular disorders, including intracranial aneurysms, carotid cavernous sinus fistulas, vertebral fistulas, arteriovenous malformations, atherosclerosis of brachiocephalic vessels, and arterial vasospasm, is being performed in selected cases by interventional neurovascular techniques.
 Recent advances in microballoon technology, permanent solidifying polymers, newer embolic agents, high-resolution digital subtraction angiography with road-mapping technique, and steerable micro-guide wires and catheters have greatly improved access in the distal intracranial circulation and markedly reduced the morbidity associated with these procedures.

 Laser-induced fluorescence has been used in conjunction with angiography for laser angioplasty guidance.
 The effect of radiopaque contrast media on the excitation and detection of arterial fluorescence has not been previously reported.
 Accordingly, fluorescence emission spectra from human coronary artery necropsy specimens (n = 7) during excitation with pulsed excimer laser excitation (308 nm) was examined before and after the addition of three different contrast media, sodium and meglumine diatrizoate, sodium and meglumine ioxaglate, and iopamidol.
 A decrease in overall fluorescence intensity was observed at all wavelengths for each contrast agent examined.
 The decrease in intensity of fluorescence emission was more marked at wavelengths less than 410 nm than at wavelengths above 425 nm.
 Similar effects were observed for contrast media diluted with whole blood.
 Absorption spectra for all three contrast media demonstrated absorption in the ultraviolet centered around 240 nm.
 We conclude that preferential absorption in the ultraviolet range by contrast media interferes with the excitation and detection of laser-induced fluorescence; use of visible light excitation may obviate interference with laser-induced fluorescence analysis of plaque.

142,"The dynamics of antegrade cardioplegia with simultaneous coronary sinus occlusion. Effects on aortic root infusion pressure, coronary sinus pressure, and myocardial cooling.
 It has been suggested that antegrade cardioplegia with coronary sinus occlusion improves homogeneous myocardial cooling and reduces myocardial injury in the presence of coronary artery occlusion.
 Little data are available on the exact relationships among the basic elements or this intervention, including antegrade infusion rate, aortic root pressure, the degree of coronary sinus occlusion, coronary sinus pressure, and myocardial cooling.
 The purpose of this study was to determine these relationships and to provide some basic guidelines for better understanding of this intervention.
 Twenty-two sheep were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, the distal left anterior descending artery was occluded, and the proximal coronary sinus was snared.
 Sixteen combinations of infusion rate (3, 5, 7, or 9 ml/kg/min) and coronary sinus occlusion (total, subtotal, or moderate occlusion or no occlusion) were adopted for each 2 minutes of antegrade cardioplegia, yielding 96 measurements.
 Myocardial temperatures in the occluded and nonoccluded regions, aortic root infusion pressure, and coronary sinus pressure were measured during each infusion of cardioplegic solution.
 Coronary sinus occlusion was then released, and the whole heart was reperfused for 30 minutes for another infusion of cardioplegic solution and measurements.
 Results showed good degrees of linearity between infusion rate and aortic root infusion pressure for all coronary sinus occlusion and noninfusion groups (p less than 0.01).
 A positive effect of coronary sinus occlusion on aortic root infusion pressure was observed.
 The graded increases in infusion rate with various degrees of coronary sinus occlusion were constantly associated with elevation of coronary sinus pressure (p less than 0.01).
 It was also noted that myocardial temperatures in the region of the occluded left anterior descending artery were significantly lower in coronary sinus occlusion groups than in nonocclusion groups (p less than 0.01 or 0.05).
 Myocardial temperature in the nonoccluded region decreased significantly with the stepwise increases in infusion rate (p less than 0.01), but not with the increases in coronary sinus occlusion (not significant).
 Based on this and previous studies, we recommend that the induced coronary sinus pressure be safely maintained in the range of 25 to 35 mm Hg and that further studies be focused on the infusion rate of 5 ml/kg/min with subtotal or total coronary sinus occlusion for the intervention of antegrade cardioplegia plus coronary sinus occlusion.

143,"Future directions in vasodilator therapy for heart failure.
 Vasodilator therapy has become a major pharmacologic approach for improving left ventricular function, and consequently, vasodilator drugs are being used increasingly in the treatment of heart failure.
 Ideally, vasodilator drugs used in the long-term management of heart failure should show clearly defined pharmacodynamic effects.
 These include reduced impedance to left ventricular ejection, increased venous capacitance, increased left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced heart size, absence of neurohormonal stimulation, and slowed progression of left ventricular dysfunction.
 The mechanisms of action and sites of activity of the various vasodilator drugs currently available vary considerably, and none as yet has proved ideal for the treatment of heart failure or hypertension.
 The complexity surrounding the multiple vasoconstrictor mechanisms involved in heart failure has led to a rationale for combined vasodilator therapy and certain combinations are discussed.
 From a therapeutic standpoint, the development of drugs with multiple mechanisms of action is particularly attractive.
 Flosequinan is a new vasodilator agent whose cellular mechanism of action remains uncertain.
 Flosequinan has the advantage of being able to relax both arterial and venous beds and as such may be particularly beneficial in the treatment of heart failure.

144,"The usefulness of lung surfactant phospholipids (LSPs) in the diagnosis of drowning.
 The authors have studied the usefulness of some lung surfactant phospholipids (LSPs) isolated from lung tissues as markers of drowning.
 Two different groups of rabbits were sacrificed by drowning in fresh and salt water, and their phospholipid compositions were compared with those of a non-drowned control series.
 For the phospholipids studied in lung lavages (phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and phosphatidyl glycerol) the proportions differed between the control group and the drowned group, and between the fresh-water and salt-water drowned animals.
 According to these results, the lipids we have analyzed can be employed as markers in forensic autopsies, where it is necessary to differentiate between death by drowning and postmortem immersion and between fresh-water and salt-water drowning.
 In lung tissue, only phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl inositol showed significative differences.
 These results also confirm that LSPs are strongly affected in drowning.

 The American College of Surgeons has stated that in considering the development of trauma systems it is important to ensure an appropriate volume of seriously injured patients be seen by each trauma center in order to achieve acceptable mortality rates.
 Clinical data supporting this recommendation are lacking.
 An analysis was performed on 1,643 seriously injured trauma patients to determine the relationship between volume and mortality rates.
 Three separate statistical methods were used: Pearson correlation coefficients, mortality odds ratios, and direct pairwise mortality comparisons.
 In addition, Tobit analysis was introduced as a method to analyze the relationship between volume and mortality.
 Mortality rates were adjusted for the confounding variable of serious head injury.
 Pearson correlation coefficients for volume vs.
 adjusted mortality was -0.65.
 Mortality odds ratios comparing the low-volume (less than 140 pts) trauma centers vs.
 the high-volume (greater than 200 pts) trauma centers was 1.3 for adjusted mortality rates (95% CI = 1.01-1.66; p = 0.04).
 Categorical analysis showed significantly different mortality rates in the centers before and after adjusting for patient mix.
 Tobit analysis showed the relationship between volume and mortality to be significant, accounting for 30-40% of the observed variation in mortality rates.
 In addition, Tobit analysis allowed construction of a model to predict mortality rates, given specific volumes of patients.
 Our data suggest that an inverse relationship exists between volume and mortality, and support the necessity of configuring trauma systems in a manner that will ensure designated trauma centers will see a high volume of seriously injured patients.

 Thrombosis of the portal vein with or without patency of its tributaries used to be a contraindication to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) until quite recently.
 Rapid progress in the surgical technique of OLTX in the last few years has demonstrated that most patients with portal vein thrombosis can be safely and successfully transplanted.
 Presented here is a series of 34 patients with portal vein thrombosis transplanted at the University of Pittsburgh since 1984.
 The various techniques used to treat various forms of thrombosis are described.
 The survival rate for this series was 67.6% (23 of 34 patients).
 Survival was best for patients who underwent phlebothrombectomy or placement of a jump graft from the superior mesenteric vein.
 The survival rate also correlated with the amount of blood required for transfusion during surgery.
 Overall it is concluded that a vast majority of the patients with thrombosis of the portal system can be technically transplanted and that their survival rate is comparable to that of patients with patent portal vein.

 Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was introduced in 1982 as a noninvasive procedure for assessment of the intracranial cerebral circulation.
 The lightweight and portable equipment used for transcranial Doppler examination facilitates its use in the bedside assessment of critically ill hospitalized patients and outpatients.
 Clinical applications include the diagnosis of vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, assessment of intracranial collateral flow in patients with extracranial arterial occlusive disease, detection of intracranial arterial stenosis, identification of the feeding arteries of arteriovenous malformations and monitoring the hemodynamic effects of their treatment, confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of brain death, intensive-care unit monitoring of brain-injured patients, and intraoperative and postoperative monitoring of neurosurgical patients.
 Transcranial Doppler technology is also providing new insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of a variety of cerebrovascular conditions.

151,"Activation of Epstein-Barr virus latent genes protects human B cells from death by apoptosis.
 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus, establishes a persistent asymptomatic infection of the circulating B-lymphocyte pool.
 The mechanism of virus persistence is not understood but, given the limited lifespan of most B cells in vivo, it seems most likely that EBV-infected cells must gain access to the long-lived memory B-cell pool.
 Here we show in an in vitro system that EBV, through expression of the full set of eight virus-coded 'latent' proteins, can protect human B cells from programmed cell death (apoptosis), the deletion mechanism which normally restricts entry into memory.
 We have found that EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell clones retaining the original tumour cell phenotype and expressing only one of the virus latent proteins, the nuclear antigen EBNA 1, are extremely sensitive to apoptosis; in this respect they resemble the tumour's normal cell of origin found in the germinal centres of lymphoid tissue.
 By contrast, isogenic BL cell clones which have activated expression of all eight EBV latent proteins are resistant to the induction of apoptosis.
 The EBV latent proteins should therefore be seen not just as activators of B-cell proliferation but, perhaps more importantly, as mediators of enhanced B-cell survival.

 Among subjects who continued to smoke, the use of cigarettes was decreased to less than 50% of the baseline smoking level in 7 of 7 with active nicotine patches and in 15 of 19 with placebo patches.
 Outcomes beyond 6 weeks showed a substantial relapse rate in both groups.
 Thus, when nicotine-replacement therapy is provided, a need exists for concurrent behavioral intervention and training for prevention of a relapse, neither of which was part of this protocol.

 STUDY HYPOTHESIS: There is considerable under-reporting of contaminated occupational needlestick and other sharp object injuries among emergency health care workers.
 POPULATION: A convenience sample of emergency physicians, emergency nurses, and emergency medical technicians (EMTs).
 METHODS: A survey instrument eliciting demographic and work-related factors was developed and administered; survey items included age, sex, occupation, years in occupation, number of procedures performed per week, number of contaminated needlestick (and other ""sharps"") injuries recalled, and number of these injuries formally reported during the previous five years.
 Nonsegmented visual analog scales were used to assess eight attitudes possibly associated with nonreporting.
 Analysis was by analysis of variance and multiple linear regression with stepwise variable election.
 RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-nine subjects recalled 643 contaminated exposures during the five-year study period, but only 228 (35%) were formally reported.
 One or more injuries occurred in 55% of EMTs compared with 72% of nurses and 80% of physicians (P less than .05).
 Physicians recalled a mean of 3.8 contaminated exposures, whereas nurses recalled 2.8 and EMTs recalled only 1.8 (P less than .05).
 Physicians formally reported a mean of 0.26 exposures, whereas EMTs reported 0.85 and nurses reported 1.25 (P less than .05).
 Physicians formally reported only one eighth of their injuries compared with EMTs and nurses, who each reported two thirds of these events (P less than .05).
 Perception of risk, occupation, years in occupation, and concern about excessive paperwork were the most powerful predictors of low reporting rate (P less than .05).

 Doxazosin, at a final mean daily dose of 3.4 mg, produced a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in blood pressure at all points of measurement during the study.
 The mean change in sitting blood pressure at the end of treatment was -15.4/-15.8 mm Hg.
 Of the 85 patients who could be categorized as a success or failure, 78 (92%) were considered a therapeutic success; 78 (89%) of the 88 efficacy-evaluable patients demonstrated an improvement in the severity category of their hypertension.
 Treatment with doxazosin produced a reduction in serum cholesterol (-3.1%) and triglyceride (-3.8%) levels, although these changes did not attain statistical significance.

 The rate of clearance of myocardial carbon-11 (11C) activity (after the administration of 11C-acetate) has been shown to correlate closely with myocardial oxygen consumption.
 In the present study, we hypothesized that regional net myocardial uptake of 11C-acetate, which reflects primarily delivery and extraction of tracer, would be markedly flow-dependent and potentially useful as an indirect index of regional myocardial blood flow.
 In 22 patients with stable coronary artery disease, the regional distribution of early net uptake of 11C-acetate was correlated with estimates of regional myocardial blood flow assessed with oxygen-15-water.
 The myocardial images of 11C-acetate uptake were of high quality.
 The correlation between the two approaches was close (r = 0.88) and not affected by the metabolic state of the tissue.
 Thus, in patients with stable coronary artery disease, under resting conditions, direct estimates of myocardial oxygen consumption in relation to the level of delivery of tracer to the tissue can now be obtained by PET with use of a single radiopharmaceutical, 11C-acetate.
 This approach may prove particularly useful in streamlining clinical protocols designed to assess myocardial oxygen consumption.

 This study assessed the long-term (54 weeks) antihypertensive efficacy and safety of doxazosin in the treatment of mild or moderate essential hypertension, defined as sitting and standing diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 114 mm Hg.
 Of the 153 patients who successfully completed an initial 14-week trial, 61 continued uninterrupted into a 40-week extension study.
 Optimal antihypertensive efficacy was achieved by week 12 and maintained in all patients for the duration of 1 year.
 The final mean sitting blood pressure was 148/84 mm Hg and was reduced from a mean baseline level of 173/102 mm Hg.
 Occasional decreases in heart rate were observed, but these were not considered to be clinically relevant (1 to 3 beats/min).
 The mean final dose of doxazosin for patients evaluable for efficacy was 2.4 mg/day; 91.7% of patients were taking less than or equal to 4 mg/day.

 Twenty-one vascular malformations located in the facial area, 11 high-flow arteriovenous malformations and 10 slow-flow malformations, underwent combined treatment by embolization and later surgery.
 Embolization was performed simultaneously with superselective angiography of the branches of the external carotid artery.
 The new biodegradable fibrosing agent Ethibloc was used in 16 cases.
 Histologic examination of the surgical specimens confirmed the good target orientation by the transarterial injection of Ethibloc.
 Limitations of this technique are discussed.
 The agent proved to have thrombogenic and fibrogenic properties.
 Some of the vascular walls degenerated and ruptured following the embolization, but there were no instances of necrosis of interstitial tissue or skin.
 Embolization treatment of vascular malformations of the face was not curative, but it facilitated subsequent surgery in all examined cases.

167,"Primary papillary carcinoma of a thyroglossal duct cyst: report of a case and literature review.
 Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common anomaly in thyroid development.
 They are twice as frequent as branchial cleft abnormalities and, in children, are second only to enlarged cervical lymph nodes as the cause of neck mass.
 Generally, duct cysts are benign, but 1 per cent of cases may be malignant.
 From the world literature, 114 cases of malignant thyroglossal cysts were available for review.
 With the addition of our own case, we discuss 115 instances of duct cysts.
 The different types of neoplasia described included thyroid papillary carcinoma in 81.7 per cent, mixed papillary-follicular carcinoma in 6.9 per cent, squamous cell carcinoma in 5.2 per cent, follicular and adenocarcinoma in 1.7 per cent each, and malignant struma, epidermoid carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma in 0.9 per cent each.
 Of the 115 cases surveyed, 35 thyroid glands were examined microscopically; of these, four (11.4 per cent) contained malignant foci.
 Whether these are primary malignancies of the thyroglossal duct cysts or metastases is discussed.

168,"Skateboarding injuries in children. A second wave.
 Motivated by a number of skateboard-related injuries seen in an emergency department, we undertook an investigation of skateboarding injuries in the mid-1980s.
 We studied US Consumer Product Safety Commission injury frequency estimates, which indicated a resurgence of these injuries: 19,182 in 1984 and 37,180 in 1985.
 Children 10 to 14 years old were injured with greatest frequency.
 Nontrivial injuries were more common among children younger than 5 years old, reflecting a larger proportion of head and neck injuries.
 Boys sustained more frequent and more severe skateboard-related injuries.
 Observed injury patterns (head and neck injuries in younger children, extremity injuries in older children, and more severe head and neck injuries in older children) probably reflect the role of psychomotor development on both risk exposure and biomechanics.
 Likely prevention strategies include warnings against skateboard use by children younger than 5 years, prohibition of skateboards on streets and highways, and the promotion of use of helmets and other protective gear.

 The early pulmonary hypertension seen with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) has been reported as resulting from the release of thromboxane A2.
 We studied the cardiopulmonary response to endotoxin in sheep with and without treatment with a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, OKY-046.
 The animals were implanted with instruments for crystallographic dimension analysis of the left ventricle and measurement of left ventricular, aortic, left atrial, and pulmonary arterial pressures and cardiac index.
 Thirteen sheep received 1.0 micrograms/kg of Escherichia coli endotoxin with (n = 6) and without (n = 7) OKY-046 (10 mg/kg bolus, then 10 micrograms/kg/min).
 OKY-046 prevented the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and decrease in cardiac index usually seen during the early phase of endotoxemia.
 Between 8 and 12 hours after the administration of endotoxin, cardiac index increased from 6.4 +/- 0.8 to 8.4 +/- 0.8 L/min/m2.
 Concomitantly, the end-systolic pressure/diameter relationship (a sensitive myocardial contractility index) significantly decreased from 14.7 +/- 0.6 to 7.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg/mm.
 Another index of the left ventricular contractility, the maximum rate of pressure rise was also reduced.

 The orally active competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists CGP 37849 (DL-[E]-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid) and its ethyl ester CGP 39551 were evaluated in amygdala-kindled rats, a model for complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures.
 Anticonvulsant and behavioral effects of these novel compounds were compared with those of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydroxy-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imin e] and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, one of the major drugs for treatment of partial and generalized seizures in humans.
 For comparative evaluation, the compounds were injected i.p.
 at the following doses: 1 to 10 mg/kg (CGP 37849 or CGP 39551), 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg (MK-801) and 20 to 40 mg/kg (carbamazepine), respectively.
 In contrast to carbamazepine, CGP 37849, CGP 39551 and MK-801 exerted only weak anticonvulsant effects in fully kindled rats and did not increase the focal seizure threshold.
 The weak anticonvulsant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonists in kindled rats were associated with profound untoward behavioral effects.
 The behavioral syndrome induced by the NMDA receptor antagonists in kindled rats was characterized by marked ataxia, hyperactivity and, in case of CGP 37849 and MK-801, stereotypies, such as head weaving.
 The low or absent effectiveness of the novel NMDA receptor antagonists against kindled seizures suggests that these compounds will not be clinically useful antiepileptics against partial and secondarily generalized seizures.
 Furthermore, in view of the recent clinical findings on psychotomimetic effects of MK-801 in epileptic patients, the similarities in the excitatory effects produced by CGP 39551, CGP 37849 and MK-801 in kindled rats may indicate that competitive NMDA receptor antagonists may also produce psychotomimetic effects in humans.

 Data were obtained and analyzed in 229 patients admitted to the coronary care unit from November 1988 through July 1989.
 The patients were classified into 2 groups: patients without or with only mild left ventricular failure (Killip class I or II) during their hospital stay (group I), and patients who were in Killip class I or II on admission but developed cardiogenic shock during hospitalization (group II).
 Discriminant function analysis was performed using the following variables: patients' age, history of previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, blood lactate, urea, creatinine, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase concentrations, and chest x-ray cardiothoracic ratio.
 Variables that were found to significantly discriminate the 2 groups of patients were age, previous infarction, x-ray cardiothoracic ratio, blood urea and lactate concentrations.
 The risk index was computed, and blood lactate was the variable with the greatest predictive power for shock development.
 The sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the risk index, taking various cutoff points, were calculated.
 With a cutoff value of 1, sensitivity was 65%, specificity 91%, positive predictive value 36% and negative predictive value 97%.
 With a cutoff value of 2, sensitivity was 53%, specificity 99%, positive predictive value 82% and negative predictive value 96%.

 The authors provide a simple radiographic method for estimating bullet weight and caliber of both deformed and undeformed bullets that enables accurate determination of caliber for the gamut of bullet shapes, with known degrees of confidence.
 The weight-determination procedure is based on the correlation between bullet cross-sectional area, as derived from three orthogonal radiographs, and bullet weight, as determined from a data base of the properties of 48 bullets removed from humans.
 Different equations were developed for bullets weighing 5.8 g or less, or more than 5.8 g.
 For relatively undeformed bullets an additional method calculated caliber directly from the diameter of the bullet body on radiographs.
 Both methods enabled correct prediction of the weight and caliber of the bullets; if one method could not be used, results of the other were reliable.
 Testimony based on these results has been accepted in a local police case and may meet requirements for testimony in U.S.

174,"Molecular basis of the activation of the tumorigenic potential of Gag-insulin receptor chimeras.
 A previous study showed that the human insulin receptor (IR) could be activated by insertion of a 3' portion of the cDNA encoding the beta subunit into a retrovirus genome to form a Gag-IR fusion protein.
 While capable of transforming cells in culture, this IR cDNA-containing virus, called UIR, was not able to induce tumors in animals.
 Subsequently, we isolated a spontaneous sarcomagenic variant called UIR19t from the parental UIR.
 UIR19t was molecularly cloned, sequenced, and found to harbor two mutations.
 A 44-amino acid deletion immediately upstream from the transmembrane domain of the Gag-IR fusion protein removes all the extracellular sequence of the IR remaining in the original UIR construct.
 In addition, a single nucleotide deletion at the 3' end results in truncation and replacement of the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids by 4 new amino acids.
 The specific kinase activity of UIR19t is 4- to 5-fold higher than that of the parental UIR.
 However, no new cellular substrates were detected in UIR19t-transformed cells as compared to UIR cells.
 Viruses containing either the 5' or the 3' deletion mutation were constructed and assessed for their biological function.
 Our data indicate that the 5' deletion alone is sufficient to confer tumorigenic ability.
 We conclude that sequence immediately upstream from the transmembrane domain imposes a negative effect on the transforming and tumorigenic potential of the Gag-IR fusion protein.

 Radiosurgery is becoming more generally available and indications for its use continue to be defined.
 Cerebral metastases from malignant melanoma are often treated with whole-brain irradiation, but with limited benefit.
 Innovative treatments, such as radiosurgery, make possible the delivery of doses of radiation that are higher than usual.
 To determine how many patients might be candidates for radiosurgery, a retrospective analysis of computed tomographic brain scans performed on 41 patients with cerebral metastases from malignant melanoma was undertaken.
 One-third of these patients were found to have cerebral metastases amenable to a radiosurgical approach, as illustrated radiation dose-volume histograms.
 Patient and tumor characteristics suggest that this series is represent with cerebral metastases from malignant melanoma.

177,"Stress-induced adrenocorticotropin secretion: diurnal responses and decreases during stress in the evening are not dependent on corticosterone.
 To test whether the diurnal rhythm in stress responsiveness is dependent on corticosterone (B)-mediated negative feedback, the responses of intact (SHAM) and adrenalectomized (ADX) rats to restraint for 3-90 minutes or ip injection with saline in the morning (AM) and the evening (PM) were compared.
 In both SHAM and ADX rats, ACTH responses to restraint stress were larger in the AM.
 In intact rats, this could have resulted from both fast negative feedback, due to the rate of rise of B during the stress in the PM, and delayed negative feedback, due to the high basal concentrations of B before the stress in the PM.
 However, this diurnal pattern of stress responsiveness was not dependent on B, as the same relative responses to restraint and ip injection were found in ADX rats.
 To determine whether the lack of response of ADX rats in the PM to stress was due to a loss of sensitivity to endogenous secretagogues, ADX rats were given CRF + arginine vasopressin (AVP) while anesthetized with ether after 30 min of restraint.
 In both the AM and the PM, the pituitaries were able to respond to exogenous secretagogues.
 A second novel finding was that in the PM, but not the AM, plasma ACTH concentrations in the ADX rats decreased substantially during the period of restraint, despite the lack of B-mediated negative feedback.
 In the AM and the PM, ADX rats were restrained for 30 min and then stressed with ether for 6 min.
 The ACTH concentrations were not different before and after ether, suggesting that, although the pituitaries of ADX rats are able to respond to exogenous CRF + AVP after stress, an additional stress of ether exposure no longer stimulates endogenous CRF and AVP release after 30 min of restraint at either time of day.
 After 90 min of restraint in the AM and the PM, the relationship between ACTH and B was positive, not negative, providing no evidence of ongoing B-mediated negative feedback in the SHAM rats.
 Therefore, the same mechanism responsible for the decrease in ACTH secretion in ADX rats may occur in SHAM rats as well.
 From these results, we conclude that the diurnal rhythm in stress responsiveness and, in the PM in the ADX rats, the decrease in plasma ACTH during stress, are largely independent of B.

 The possibility of detecting myocardial infarction (MI) in the presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome by means of body surface QRST isoarea maps was studied in eight dogs.
 Eighty-seven body surface ECGs were recorded simultaneously.
 Recordings were taken during right atrial (RA) and right atrial and right ventricular (RA + RV) sequential pacing, which simulated WPW syndrome, during control periods and at 1-hour intervals for up to 5 hours after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery.
 In ECGs during the RA drive, diagnostic findings of MI such as abnormal Q waves were observed but became obscure during the RA + RV drive.
 On the contrary, the QRST values over the anterior chest during both drives were positive soon after coronary occlusion, decreased gradually as time passed, and became abnormally negative after 5 hours.
 The QRST isoarea maps during RA and RA + RV pacing showed quite similar patterns and were highly correlated with each other throughout this study (r greater than 0.95).
 These findings demonstrate that localized abnormalities resulting from MI are evident in QRST isoarea maps even in the presence of preexcitation and fusion.

 To detect dynamic changes of VLPs we developed a low-noise, HR-ECG with a gain of 10(5)-10(6)X.
 This system allows the beat-to-beat detection of low-amplitude signals at the bedside in a nonshielded room without any averaging process.
 Analysis was performed in 39 normal subjects (group A: 27 men, 12 women, mean age, 28 +/- 8 years), in 98 patients with coronary artery disease without documented sustained ventricular tachycardia (group B: 86 men, 12 women, mean age, 59 +/- 10 years) and in 41 patients coronary artery disease with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (group C: 36 men, 5 women; mean age 63 +/- 9 years).
 Comparison was made with time-domain signal-averaging (SA-ECG) in all cases at the same electrode position and with identical band-pass filtering.
 In group A no VLPs were detected; the total filtered QRS duration was 84 +/- 8 msec (mean +/- SD), and the time interval during which the terminal QRS did not exceed 40 microV (I-40) was less than 30 msec in all cases (mean, 17 +/- 6 msec).
 In group B, VLPs were detected by HR-ECG in 34 of 98 patients (35%); the total QRS duration was 102 +/- 16 msec (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01 vs group A), and the I-40 was 29 +/- 13 msec (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01 vs (group A).
 In group C, VLPs were detected by HR-ECG in 38 of 41 patients (93%); the total QRS duration was 123 +/- 22 msec (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01 vs group A and group B), and the I-40 was 40 +/- 14 msec (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01 vs group A and group B).
 Concordant results between HR-ECG and SA-ECG were observed in 91% of the cases (59 positive and 103 negative results).
 Late potentials that exhibited dynamic variations were detected by HR-ECG alone in 13 cases, and very low amplitude VLPs were detected by SA-ECG alone in three cases.
 In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the feasibility of body-surface recording of VLPs on a beat-to-beat basis, without any averaging process, at the bedside in a nonshielded room.
 This new approach may allow the study of dynamic changes of VLPs during spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias or ischemia.

 Sphingosine and other long-chain (sphingoid) bases inhibit protein kinase C, the putative cellular receptor for the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and exert potent effects on diverse cell functions.
 We tested the ability of long-chain bases to modulate multistage carcinogenesis in mouse C3H/10T1/2 cells exposed to gamma-rays and PMA.
 Sphingosine and sphinganine completely blocked the enhancement of radiation-induced transformation by PMA (promotion) and partially suppressed transformation by radiation alone.
 N-Acetylsphingosine, a ceramide analog, did not inhibit transformation.
 Sphingosine was rapidly taken up by the cells and metabolized; hence, the long-chain bases were added daily to achieve prolonged inhibition.
 Long-chain bases inhibited protein kinase C activity in C3H/10T1/2 cells and suppressed the down-regulation of this enzyme by PMA.
 Our results establish that long-chain bases are highly effective inhibitors of carcinogenesis in this model.
 Our results also indicate that the suppressive effects may be mediated, in part, by inhibition of protein kinase C.
 The data suggest that sphingosine and other long-chain bases derived from complex sphingolipids may act as cancer-preventative agents.

 Poliovirus-sensitive transgenic mice were produced by introducing the human gene encoding cellular receptors for poliovirus into the mouse genome.
 Expression of the receptor mRNAs in tissues of the transgenic mice was analyzed by using RNA blot hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction.
 The human gene is expressed in many tissues of the transgenic mice just as in tissues of humans.
 The transgenic mice are susceptible to all three poliovirus serotypes, and the mice inoculated with poliovirus show clinical symptoms similar to those observed in humans and monkeys.
 Rabbit antipoliovirus serum detects the antigens mainly in motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and in nerve cells in the medulla oblongata and pons of the paralyzed transgenic mice.
 Therefore, cell types sensitive to poliovirus in the central nervous system of the transgenic mice appear to be identical to those of humans and monkeys.
 Furthermore, many more doses of oral poliovirus vaccine strains than of the virulent strains are required to cause paralysis in the transgenic mice.
 This may reflect the observation that the virulent strain multiplies more efficiently in the central nervous system than the attenuated strain.
 Thus, the transgenic mice may become an excellent new animal model to study molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of poliovirus and to assess oral poliovirus vaccines.

 The in vitro and in vivo analysis of the ribonuclease E-deficient (rne-) and the altered mRNA stability protein-deficient (ams-) strains of Escherichia coli has demonstrated that they carry mutations in the same structural gene.
 Strains encoding either thermolabile RNase E (rne-3071) or Ams protein (ams-1) are defective in both rRNA processing and mRNA turnover.
 Immediately after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature, the chemical decay rate of bulk mRNA is slowed 2- to 3-fold, and within 70 min, precursors to 5S rRNA begin to accumulate.
 In addition, all of the phenotypes associated with either the rne-3071 or the ams-1 alleles were complemented by a recombinant plasmid carrying ams+.

 Cyclosporine, a powerful immunosuppressant, has been used successfully for organ transplantation.
 Its efficacy on liver transplants of patients with primary hepatic tumors remains controversial because of a high rate of recurrence of the original tumors in the transplanted livers.
 In this study, we experimentally tested whether cyclosporine exerts any effects on the growth of carcinogen-initiated liver cells using the short-term assays of rat liver carcinogenesis.
 Dietary cyclosporine, which maintained sufficient levels of blood cyclosporine and suppressed host immune functions, enhanced the development of the glutathione S-transferase, placental form-positive hepatocyte foci in the liver of male F-344 rats treated with a single weekly dose of diethylnitrosamine (75 mg/kg) for 3 wk.
 Dietary cyclosporine also accelerated the growth of preformed glutathione S-transferase, placental form-positive foci induced by a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (250 mg/kg) followed by the promoting regimen of a choline-deficient diet.
 It is possible that the enhancement of the size of hepatocyte foci by cyclosporine could be due to stimulation of growth or inhibition of regression.
 The mechanisms by which cyclosporine modifies the growth of preneoplastic lesions in the liver are not yet fully understood.
 Possible involvement of immunologically relevant cells in the liver, Kupffer cells and pit cells in the process is suggested.

 The initial clinical response to surgery was graded excellent, good, fair, or poor; 5-year follow-up was available in 55% of cases.

 A significant (P less than .003) correlation existed between good or excellent response to surgery and an increased CSF flow void.
 The presence of associated deep white matter infarction on MR images did not correlate with a poor response to surgery.
 On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that patients who fulfill the clinical criteria of NPH and have an increased CSF flow void undergo creation of a shunt.

 Sixteen children underwent 18 operations for radical resection of chiasmatic-hypothalamic tumors.
 The clinical presentation correlated with age: infants under 1 year of age presented with macrocephaly, failure to thrive, and severe visual failure; children aged 1 to 5 years predominantly had precocious puberty with mild visual deficits; and older children (greater than 5 years old) had slowly progressive loss of vision.
 All three infants had biologically aggressive tumors in spite of low-grade histology, and died from progressive tumor growth.
 Eleven of the 13 children aged 1 year or over are alive and well, without clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression, 4 months to 4 1/2 years following surgery.
 Six of these patients, with a follow-up period of 10 months to 4 1/2 years (mean 27 months), have had no adjuvant therapy following radical surgical resection.
 The authors conclude that: 1) radical surgical resection of chiasmatic-hypothalamic tumors can be performed with minimal morbidity; 2) radical resection may delay the time to disease progression in older children and postpone the need for irradiation; 3) resection of postirradiation recurrent tumors may provide neurological improvement and long-lasting clinical remission; and 4) chiasmatic-hypothalamic tumors of infancy are aggressive neoplasms that require multimodality therapy.

 The benefits of continuous antihypertensive therapy have been extensively documented.
 However, lack of compliance with the prescribed regimen, excessive cost, and troublesome adverse effects of some antihypertensive agents led to the consideration of intermittent therapy or even complete discontinuation of therapy as an effective alternative to lifelong medication.
 Prospective studies dealing with this subject reported inconsistent results.
 Nevertheless, they allowed us to identify selection criteria of candidates for step-down or discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy.
 Such candidates include patients with mild essential hypertension who have one or more of the following characteristics: young age, normal body weight, low salt intake, no alcohol consumption, low pretreatment blood pressure, successful therapy with one drug only, and no or only minimal signs of target organ damage.
 Stopping antihypertensive therapy without subsequent rise in arterial pressure was shown to be possible in a subset of patients with mild essential hypertension for a period of months to years.
 This approach appears to be safe, provided that blood pressure is monitored frequently, and may improve compliance, save treatment costs, and reduce adverse effects of certain drugs, although its long-term consequences for morbidity and mortality remain to be determined.

 Juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) is a good model for the study of myeloproliferation because JCML hematopoietic progenitor cells grow in vitro at very low cell densities without the addition of exogenous stimulus.
 Previous studies have demonstrated that this proliferation is dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and that removal of monocytes from the cell population before culture eliminates this ""spontaneous"" myeloproliferation, suggesting a paracrine role of monocyte stimulation.
 However, subsequent studies have shown that increased GM-CSF production from the JCML monocytes is not a consistent finding and therefore not a plausible sole mechanism.
 In examining hematopoietic growth factor dose-response curves, both JCML GM and erythroid nonadherent progenitor cell populations displayed a marked and selective hypersensitivity to GM-CSF.
 Responses to interleukin-3 and G-CSF were identical to control dose-response curves.

 CNV3 amplitudes were increased as well, but only at electrode positions C3 and C4 and not at Fz.
 CNV3, which allows for analysis of both an early and a late CNV component, could improve the discrimination of migraine without aura beyond that of CNV1.
 In migraine with aura all CNV parameters were at control levels, confirming previous results.
 The data obtained are discussed in terms of arousal, activation and stress and the ""biobehavioral model of migraine"" (Welch, 1986).

192,"Diagnostic and prognostic value of electrophysiologic tests in meralgia paresthetica.
 Electrophysiologic diagnosis of unilateral meralgia paresthetica is usually assessed by side-to-side comparison of SNAP amplitudes, SNCVs, and SEP latencies following stimulation of lateral femoral cutaneous nerves.
 To determine the relevance for diagnosis of these tests and side-to-side comparison, the results were compared in patients with unilateral meralgia paresthetica and normal subjects.
 The long-term outcome was also considered, in order to determine whether electrophysiologic findings contribute to the prognosis.
 In our study, SNAP amplitude comparison was found to be more useful for diagnosis than SNCV and SEP latency comparisons.
 However the value of the SNAP amplitude on the affected side, just as the results of the other tests, was not found to be predictive of the outcome.
 Also the results of the tests depend on the methods used and on the nerve's route.

193,"A population-based study of functional status and social support networks of elderly patients newly diagnosed with cancer.
 We assessed the functional status and social support networks of 799 men and women aged 65 years or older newly diagnosed with cancer and living in six New Mexico counties.
 Functional limitations included depending on others for transportation (33%) and mental incompetence or poor recent memory (42%).
 The percentage of patients with functional limitation increased sharply with increasing age.
 In a substantial number of patients there was also evidence for poor social support networks; 26.5% of subjects lived alone and 38.9% had no children living in the vicinity.
 In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the predictors of having a poor social support network included non-Hispanic white ethnicity, advanced age, low income, and being a recent migrant to the area.
 Subjects with functional limitations were more likely to have poor social support networks than subjects without such limitations.
 The deleterious combination of impaired functional status and a limited social support network may explain why elderly cancer patients are at increased risk for not receiving appropriate therapy.
 Given the potential complexities involving the evaluation and appropriate treatment of cancer, care must be taken to adequately assess functional status and support mechanisms of older patients, and to provide adequate support to ensure compliance with treatment.

194,"Prediction of free phenytoin levels based on [total phenytoin]/[albumin] ratios. Potential errors with hypoalbuminemia.
 Therapeutic monitoring of the pharmacologically active (free drug) fraction of protein-bound medications (e.g., phenytoin) represents a major diagnostic challenge in clinical and laboratory medicine.
 While free drug levels may be beneficial in many clinical situations, current methods for predicting free phenytoin concentrations are unreliable and not recommended for general use.
 The authors have demonstrated a linear relationship (r2 = 0.98) between serum levels of total and bound phenytoin in 56 patients with seizure disorders.
 No significant correlations were observed when total phenytoin and albumin levels were compared independently to measured concentrations of free phenytoin or percent free phenytoin.
 A good correlation (r2 = 0.89) existed between free phenytoin levels and [total phenytoin]/[albumin] ratios in patients with normal or elevated albumin levels, but significantly weaker correlations were found in patients with hypoalbuminemia.
 Thus, [total phenytoin]/[albumin] ratios may have clinical value in predicting free phenytoin levels in uncomplicated patients without hypoalbuminemia.

 Spontaneous evolution of pouch and anal function, and absorption features has been assessed in 15 patients who underwent proctocolectomy with J ileal pouch anastomosis without conservation of a rectal muscular cuff.
 All the patients were studied before preileostomy closure and six and 12 months after the closure of the protection loop ileostomy.
 Stool frequency was identical at six and 12 months (mean +/- SEM: 5.0 +/- 0.4 and 5.3 +/- 0.5/day, respectively).
 Sixty-six percent of patients at six months and 40% of patients at 12 months need to defecate at least one time during night.
 Stool weight as well as steatorrhea decreased significantly six months after the closure of loop ileostomy (P less than 0.05).
 Mean resting anal pressure remained unchanged six and 12 months after closure of the loop ileostomy (41 +/- 6 and 45 +/- 5 cm H2O, respectively).
 Maximum squeeze anal pressures increased significantly at six (P less than 0.05) and 12 months (P less than 0.05).
 The rectoanal inhibitory reflex was always absent at the same period.
 The maximum pouch capacity increased significantly during the first six months (P less than 0.01) from 142 +/- 17 to 279 +/- 27 ml.
 The maximum infused volume during a saline continence test was not significantly different at six and 12 months; the percentage of evacuation of the reservoir and the volume at which the first ileal contraction appeared in the reservoir increased significantly (P less than 0.05) at six and 12 months.
 In conclusion, in patients with ileoanal anastomosis and pouch reservoir, the closure of the loop ileostomy is associated with spontaneous modifications of the anal and pouch parameters.

 Empirical data indicate that the nonpharmacologic treatments of biofeedback, relaxation, and stress coping training can serve as useful adjunctive or alternative procedures, and that the combined use of medication and nonpharmacologic treatments yields the greatest clinical outcome.

 The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil is currently under intense study.
 Despite much clinical experience, no detailed invasive hemodynamic studies of its use in cardiac patients have been published.
 In the present study, hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured in 10 cardiac patients undergoing catheterization of the right and left sides of the heart, before and after sedation with intravenous diazepam, and after reversal of sedation with flumazenil.
 A sleep dose of diazepam (12.2 +/- 5.1 mg, mean +/- SD) caused only slight decreases in mean arterial pressure (103 +/- 12 to 98 +/- 14 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (13.2 +/- 6.3 to 11.7 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (20.8 +/- 7.5 to 17.3 +/- 10.0 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), with no significant changes in respiratory gas homeostasis.
 Intravenous flumazenil (0.22 +/- 0.07 mg) resulted in spontaneous awakening and return to full orientation, yet caused no significant alteration in either hemodynamic or respiratory variables measured.
 Reversal of diazepam-induced sedation by flumazenil in cardiac patients appears safe and effective.

198,"Chronologic age, time since injury, and time of measurement: effect on adjustment after spinal cord injury.
 People are now living longer after spinal cord injury (SCI), yet only limited research has addressed the issue of aging and adjustment after SCI.
 The purpose of this study was to use a time-sequential design to identify the relationship between adjustment after SCI and three facets of aging; chronologic age, time since injury, and time of measurement.
 Life Situation Questionnaires were obtained from one sample of participants with SCI in 1974 (n = 256) and from a second sample in 1985 (n = 193).
 Participants were grouped into five cohorts based on chronologic age, five cohorts based on time since injury, and two groups based on time of measurement (1974, 1985).
 Two two-way MANOVA's were performed, one between chronologic age and time of measurement, and the other between time since injury and time of measurement.
 Results indicated that chronologic age and time since injury often worked in opposing directions; as some aspects of adjustment declined with greater chronologic age, but other aspects improved with increasing time since injury.
 Activity was strongly related to chronologic age, but medical stability was more strongly related to time since injury.
 Both chronologic age and time since injury were correlated with some aspects of life satisfaction.
 Comparisons between the two times of measurement (1974, 1985) indicated some limited positive changes in adjustment with time.
 The results point to the complexity of the relationship between aging and adjustment and the need for rehabilitation professionals to consider multiple aging factors.

199,"Response of oral leukoplakia to beta-carotene.
 Leukoplakia is associated with increased risk of oral cancer and is considered a premalignant lesion.
 Retinoids, particularly 13-cis retinoic acid, can frequently reverse leukoplakia.
 However, these drugs have considerable toxicity and are not suitable for large-scale use in the prevention of oral cancer.
 Beta-carotene is a naturally occurring, nontoxic carotenoid with biologic properties that suggest that it might be efficacious against oral leukoplakia.
 In 1986, we began a randomized study of 13-cis retinoic acid (1 mg/kg/d) versus beta-carotene (30 mg/d) in leukoplakia.
 However, owing to the marked differences in toxicity between the two compounds outlined in the consent form, 11 of the initial 16 eligible patients refused to participate unless they were ""guaranteed"" beta-carotene.
 Therefore, the study design was changed to a phase II trial of beta-carotene in which the compound was given daily for 3 months.
 Responding patients were continued for another 3 months of treatment.
 All lesions were examined histologically at entry.
 Responses were monitored by bidimensional measurements and photography done at entry, then monthly while on treatment and at study completion.
 Twenty-four evaluable patients were treated, and 17 had major responses (two complete, 15 partial), a response rate of 71% (95% confidence limits, 53% to 89%).
 There was no significant toxicity requiring drug discontinuation or dose reduction.
 These results indicate that beta-carotene has substantial activity in oral premalignancy.
 Because of its lack of toxicity, it is an excellent candidate for a preventive agent for oral cancer.

 A retrospective study of patient outcome, based on admission computed tomography, was carried out in 75 consecutive patients with head injury.
 Computed tomography data collected included the type and extent of intracranial hemorrhage, the extent of midline shift, and the ratio of midline shift compared with the extent of intracranial hemorrhage.
 Midline shift was considered to be out of proportion to intracranial hemorrhage when the midline shift of the septum pellucidum exceeded the extent of the hemorrhage as measured radially from the inner table of the skull.
 When computed tomography data were analyzed by logistic regression, significant predictive factors for poor outcome were intracranial hemorrhage (34%), intracranial hemorrhage with midline shift (61%), and midline shift out of proportion to the extent of intracranial hemorrhage (88%).
 When patient outcome and mortality rates are considered, our study indicates that midline shift out of proportion to the extent of intracranial hemorrhage is a highly useful predictor of poor patient outcome following head injury.

 Implantable central venous access devices placed via the subclavian vein may become obstructed by thrombosis, impingement against a vein wall, or compression between the clavicle and first rib.
 The latter has been termed pinch-off syndrome (POS).
 Eleven patients with POS were studied, including one whose catheter had fractured and one whose catheter had fragmented.
 They were compared with 22 matched control patients and 100 consecutive routine clinic patients.
 Each catheter was graded: 0 = normal, 1 = abrupt change in course with no luminal narrowing, 2 = luminal narrowing, and 3 = complete catheter fracture.
 POS was present in most (eight of 11) cases within 3 weeks after placement.
 A grade 1 catheter was common (33%) among control subjects, but grades 2 and 3 were uncommon (1%).
 Catheter fracture or fragmentation was seen in two of five cases with long-term (greater than 3 weeks) pinching (grade 2 catheter).
 The following conclusions were reached: Grade 2 represents significant catheter compression and the potential for serious complications.
 Grade 1 is of uncertain clinical significance, due to its high prevalence in control subjects.

 The natural history of severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis has been well documented.
 However, the natural history of moderate aortic stenosis remains poorly understood.
 Therefore, a group of 66 patients was identified who had a diagnosis of moderate aortic stenosis at the time of cardiac catheterization (aortic valve area 0.7 to 1.2 cm2) and who did not have surgical therapy during the 1st 180 days after cardiac catheterization.
 During a mean follow-up period of 35 months, 14 patients died of causes attributed to aortic stenosis and 21 underwent aortic valve replacement.
 The estimated probability for remaining free of any complication of aortic stenosis at the end of the first 4 years was 59%.
 Symptomatic patients with decreased ejection fraction or hemodynamic evidence of left ventricular decompensation were at greater risk for these complications.
 It is concluded that patients with moderate aortic stenosis are at significant risk for the development of complications.

 Compared with continuous-wave lasers, excimer lasers exhibit several in vitro advantages: nonthermal ablation process and linear relation between the number of pulses and the depth of the crater.
 A 308 nm, 20 nsec pulse duration, 1 to 5 repetition rate laser was specifically designed for clinical application.
 At the time of cardiopulmonary bypass in 10 symptomatic patients, before bypass grafting, a 1 mm diameter core specifically ultraviolet-tipped fiberoptic scope was introduced via the coronary arteriotomy and placed upstream (seven patients) and downstream (three patients) in contact with the stenosis.
 Laser power was increasingly delivered up to the clearing of the stenosis or occlusion.
 Quality of angioplasty was controlled by calibration of the neolumen, cardioplegic solution output through the laser-treated segment, and an eighth day or sixth month coronary arteriogram.
 In the first three patients studied on the eighth day, all laser-treated coronary artery segments showed an early parallel-linked patent neolumen despite competitive bypass graft flow.
 In the patients studied after 6 months, all recanalized segments were patent except one; in one patient the venous graft was occluded, but the upstream laser angioplasty was patent.
 The main limitation of the method lies in the fact that laser coronary recanalization is confined to the fiber core diameter.
 We conclude that (1) excimer laser angioplasty may be safe and efficient during surgical procedure and (2) as catheter flexibility remains the most critical problem, we are now assuming an appropriate tool with a multifiber system that is suitable for intraoperative as well as percutaneous routes.

 Of 1165 patients with stomach cancer included in a national, prospective multicenter study with 51 surgical units participating, information about weight loss before diagnosis was available for 855 patients (73%).
 Median weight loss was 5 kg; 259 patients (31%) experienced no weight loss.
 By logistic regression analysis the authors found that weight loss increased with age and advancing stages of disease (TNM Stage I-IV), with decreasing Karnofsky index, in Lauren's diffuse versus intestinal tumor type, and with tumors located at the cardia/esophagus.
 Increasing weight loss reduced the resectability rate significantly, but no association between weight loss and postoperative complication rate was found.
 The odds ratio for postoperative mortality was 2.5 to 1 for the weight loss group 5 to 10kg versus 0 kg.
 In conclusion, weight loss reflects a less favorable tumor status.
 Weight loss did not increase postoperative morbidity but did lead Weight to a higher death rate after surgery.

 The reliability of stimulated and spontaneous GH levels for identifying the child with low GH secretion has been the subject of debate.
 We compared the ability of GH concentrations after pharmacological stimulation with levodopa and clonidine and of spontaneous peak and 12-h pooled GH concentrations during sleep on a single night to estimate the maximum spontaneous GH secretion from 2 nights in 55 children, aged 5-16 yr, with heights below the 3rd percentile and/or height velocities below the 25th percentile for age, who had two consecutive overnight GH secretory profiles.
 Maximum stimulated GH concentrations correctly categorized 80% of children who had maximum spontaneous GH concentrations above and below 4 micrograms/L using a double monoclonal immunoradiometric assay for GH (Tandem-R HGH, Hybritech).
 The remaining 20% of children had stimulated GH concentrations below but spontaneous GH concentrations above 4 micrograms/L.
 Using this cut-off, the maximum GH concentrations from the first and second nights correctly categorized 98% and 95% of the children, respectively.
 Night to night variation in GH secretion was low in children who had low spontaneous GH secretion (maximum spontaneous peak and pool GH concentrations, less than 4 and less than or equal to 0.7 micrograms/L, respectively), and pooled GH concentrations from the 2 nights were concordant in 98% of the cases.
 We conclude that it is not uncommon for stimulated GH concentrations to underestimate spontaneous GH secretion.
 Even without acclimatization to the hospital setting, measurement of spontaneous GH secretion on a single night was more reliable for identifying the child with low endogenous GH secretion than was GH stimulation testing alone.

207,"Can clinical judgment detect children with speech-language problems?
 Pediatricians often rely on clinical judgment derived from observation or parental concern to identify children with developmental problems.
 The less popular but recommended alternative is to repeatedly administer standardized screening tests.
 Such tests are time consuming but, unlike clinical judgment, have known detection rates.
 Preliminary research concerning clinical judgment showed that clusters of parental concerns related to their childrens' performances on screening tests.
 In the present study, previous research was refined by assessment of the meaning of parents' concerns about their childrens' speech-language development.
 In this study of 157 families seeking pediatric care, 72% of children whose speech-language screening yielded positive results had parents who were concerned about their speech-language development.
 Of children with negative screening results, 83% had parents with no concerns about their speech-language development.
 Although standardized screening tests should be used occasionally in the developmental surveillance process, the findings show that the problems of most children with developmental problems were detected through clinical judgment based on parental concern.

 Those patients with a new complaint at an interval between scheduled follow-up visits and who went on to have tests to document a recurrence were categorized as interval follow-up.
 Those who were seen at a prearranged regular follow-up period and received tests as recommended by the attending physician or surgeon and had a documented recurrence were classified as routine follow-up.
 Thirteen patients presented with new contralateral primary disease and 51 with metastatic disease (16, bone; 13, lung; 11, local; three, liver, and eight, multiple).
 The median time to discovery of recurrence from the primary treatment was 29 and 28 months for the interval and routine groups, respectively.
 Ninety per cent of the failures occurred by 53 months.
 The survival time after recurrence was significantly greater in those patients diagnosed routinely (p = 0.003).

 The study city (population, 2 million residents) was divided into 156 geographic grids (each 4.5 by 3 miles) and the incidence and relative severity of various injury mechanisms were determined for each zone.
 Results: In one year (1988), there were more than 115,000 separate EMS incidents involving more than 150,000 patients, 26,000 of whom were transported for injuries incurred in 10,064 motor vehicle accidents, 4,587 falls, 4,015 lacerations/stabwounds, 1,796 beatings, 1,270 gunshots, and 952 auto-pedestrian accidents.
 Analysis of the 156 zones showed a disproportionate number of EMS responses in the city center with two centralmost grids accounting for about 25% of all responses.
 Call volume then progressively diminished toward the periphery of the city.
 However, with some very minor exceptions, the relative incidence and severity of the various injury mechanisms remained proportionally uniform within each zone, regardless of geographic location.
 Therefore, contrary to popular notoriety, the incidence and associated severity of any given injury type generally was not necessarily predicted by any particular neighborhood predilection for it, but rather by the overall demand for EMS in that zone of the city.

 Nursing home and congregate apartment residents (N = 598) were classified on the basis of a DSM-IIIR symptom checklist as suffering possible major, minor, or no depression; they also completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS).
 Possible major depressives reported more intense pain and a greater number of localized pain complaints than did minor depressives; nondepressed individuals reported the least intense pain and fewest localized complaints.
 The effect remained strong even when functional disability and health status were controlled statistically.

 Inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from a glucose-responsive rat insulinoma showed an ATP- and Mg2(+)-dependent uptake of Ca2+.
 The Km (concentration giving half-maximal activity) for Ca2+ was 60 nM.
 In the presence of 0.4 microM free Ca2+, the Km for ATP was 15 microM, and the Km for Mg2+ was 4 microM.
 Glucose (30 mM) decreased Ca2+ uptake by 50%, while other insulin secretagogues had no effect, except for glyceraldehyde, which stimulated Ca2+ uptake.
 Calmodulin increased the uptake of Ca2+, while trifluoperazine and vanadate inhibited the uptake.
 The Ca2(+)- and Mg2(+)-dependent ATPase from this tumor has a 10- to 20-fold higher requirement for Ca2+, which suggests that this enzyme is not responsible for Ca2+ transport, rather, Ca2+ transport activity represents only a small fraction of the total Ca2(+)-ATPase activity.
 The physiological importance of Ca2+ transport in insulin secretion is evident from the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by glucose, which leads to a decrease in Ca2+ efflux from the cell.
 This inhibition would lead to an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ and insulin release.

 Laser ablation of veins after injection of wavelength-specific dyes to enhance and localize energy absorption could provide a useful adjunct to current treatment options.
 To enhance the absorption of diode laser energy at 808 nm, ear veins of 41 rabbits were infused with 2 to 3 ml of indocyanine green dye (maximum absorption, 805 nm) and exposed for 2 to 20 seconds.
 Animals were killed between 0 and 28 days after operation.
 Discrete time intervals of laser exposure exist during which various-sized vessels can be ablated without significant thermal injury to the overlying tissue.
 Small vessels (0.2 mm in diameter) blanch after 2 to 3 seconds of exposure, whereas medium-sized vessels (2 mm in diameter) require 8 to 10 seconds.
 Vessels can be ablated with a power density as low as 11.1 W/cm2.
 Specimens taken immediately after laser exposure show vessel wall thinning and a reirradiation effect, created as laser energy initially absorbed by dye is reemitted.
 By the seventh day after operation, a brisk inflammatory response and acanthosis of the overlying epidermal layer develop.
 The lumen is partially filled by thrombus with cellular invasion.
 By postoperative day 28, the epidermal thickening and inflammatory reaction have resolved; the vessel walls are fibrotic.

 The F9 teratocarcinoma cell line differentiates in vitro after treatment with retinoic acid and cAMP and has been a widely used model system for the study of the molecular events that are responsible for cellular commitment and differentiation during early development.
 Previous experiments have suggested intriguing parallels between the control of gene expression during F9 cell differentiation and the regulation of gene expression by adenovirus E1A.
 Transfection of a 12S E1A-expressing plasmid into terminally differentiated, nonproliferating F9 cells generates, at high frequency, colonies of dividing cells, each of which expresses E1A.
 Cell lines established from these colonies proliferate in the presence of retinoic acid and have lost the fully differentiated phenotype as characterized by the absence of expression of a series of differentiation-specific genes.
 We conclude that expression of the viral 12S E1A gene product interferes with retinoic acid-induced F9 cell differentiation.
 Moreover, the results suggest that the differentiation process, as defined by markers of terminal differentiation, may not be a permanent event but can be reversed by E1A expression.

 After baseline noncontrast CT was performed, DSBCT was performed with a 180-mL intravenous bolus administered at 2 mL/sec.
 Scanning was started 25 seconds after the bolus was initiated, by using a 3-second scan time and rapid cephalocaudal table incrementation, yielding contiguous 8-mm-thick sections at a rate of nine sections per minute.
 On postcontrast images, peak enhancement was 115% for iopamidol and 117% for iohexol, both of which were superior to iothalamate meglumine at 95% (P less than .05).
 After peaking, enhancement then decreased for all three contrast agents, although the decline was more precipitous for iothalamate meglumine.
 Enhancement on the more caudal sections with both iopamidol and iohexol was superior to that with iothalamate meglumine (P less than .05).
 The data suggest that the enhancement characteristics for the two nonionic agents may be more optimal for detection of focal hepatic lesions than the ionic agent.

220,"Patient evaluation for cardiac transplantation.
 The aim for cardiac transplantation is to improve the quality of life and the survival in patients with end-stage heart failure.
 Given the scarcity of donor organ availability, the expense of the transplantation process and follow-up care, as well as the tremendous emotional burden the process places on a patient and his/her family, it is essential to carefully screen potential candidates for their symptomatic, functional, hemodynamic, and psychosocial eligibility, and to rule out coexisting hemodynamic or comorbid conditions that would jeopardize successful transplantation and immunosuppression.
 Comprehensive screening of potential transplant candidates, which is best accomplished by a multidisciplinary team approach working closely with patients and their families, is essential to insure that maximum benefit is derived from this scarce and valuable resource.

221,"Elevated insulin, norepinephrine, and neuropeptide Y in hypertension.
 To investigate the relationship between insulin and sympathetic activity, plasma norepinephrine, neuropeptide Y, serum glucose and insulin concentrations were measured in ten age-, weight-, and sex-matched normotensive and untreated hypertensive subjects at fasting and 2 h following ingestion of a 75 g oral glucose dose.
 Hypertensives had higher fasting serum insulin (27 +/- 6 v 12 +/- 2 microU/mL; P = .02) and plasma norepinephrine (356 +/- 38 v 235 +/- 35 pg/mL; P = .03) concentrations than normotensives.
 Glucose load increased serum insulin (P less than .001) and plasma norepinephrine concentrations (P = .001) in both groups and hypertensives had still higher postglucose insulin (P = .003) and norepinephrine levels (P = .003) than normotensives.
 Fasting neuropeptide Y was higher in hypertensives than in normotensives (P = .03) and correlated with age in both groups (r = 0.7; r = 0.77).
 Postglucose serum insulin correlated positively with plasma norepinephrine (r = 0.75; P = .013) in normotensives, but these parameters correlated negatively in hypertensives (r = -0.7; P = .036).
 We hypothesize that elevated plasma norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y levels reflect an increased level of sympathetic nervous activity in hypertensives, which in turn may be responsible for the abnormal relationship between plasma NE and insulin levels.

 We designed a protocol that included 2 months of intensive Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide; Bristol-Myers Co, Evansville, IN), high-dose methotrexate (MTX), high-dose cytarabine (ara-C), and vincristine (HiC-COM) to improve event-free survival (EFS) for patients with advanced-stage Burkitt's lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
 We also wished to test the feasibility of rapidly cycling Cytoxan and high-dose ara-C based on signs of early marrow recovery.
 Twenty patients including 12 with stage III Burkitt's lymphoma and eight with stage IV Burkitt's lymphoma or B-cell ALL were entered onto this pilot study.
 The rate of complete remission was 95%.
 Four patients have relapsed.
 The 2-year actuarial EFS was 75% (median follow-up, 37 months).
 Two of the initial five patients developed transverse myelitis, which we believe may have been secondary to the concomitant administration of intrathecal (IT) and high-dose systemic ara-C.
 We conclude that this short but intensive regimen is highly effective for patients with advanced Burkitt's lymphoma and B-cell ALL.
 EFS has improved over previous less intensive regimens, and is comparable to regimens of longer duration.

 Increases in cocaine use have created a new and challenging cohort of problem drinkers with dual or multiple addictions.
 As part of a randomized trial comparing alternative alcoholism treatments at a 10,000-employee industrial plant, we interviewed 224 new alcoholic clients of an employee assistance program (EAP); 40% used cocaine during the 6 months just prior to EAP intake.
 Compared to employees reporting no recent cocaine use, the cocaine users were younger, less often married and reported heavier drinking and more alcohol-related problems, on the job and off.
 Even after controlling for demographic and occupational factors, and drinking indicators, cocaine users reported more binges (being drunk 24 hours or more), more blackouts (marginally significant, p = .06), more absenteeism and more warnings about unacceptable job performance.
 Alcoholic EAP clients who use cocaine appear to engage in riskier drinking and to have more trouble on the job than do those who report no cocaine use, and this seems to be a difference specifically attributable to their use of cocaine.

224,"The clinical efficacy of triple-injection wrist arthrography.
 Triple-injection wrist arthrography has been demonstrated to increase the likelihood that all the ligamentous perforations in an injured wrist will be diagnosed.
 However, compared with imaging after single injection of contrast material into the radiocarpal joint, triple-injection arthrography not only increases patient expense but also significantly increases the time required of both patients and arthrographers to obtain the diagnosis.
 With the goal of decreasing the number of triple injections, the author reviewed 50 consecutive triple-injection wrist arthrograms.
 Using a technique based on high-volume injection of contrast material to achieve complete distention of the joint, the author achieved a false-negative rate for demonstration of complete perforations with radiocarpal injection alone of only 2% (10% if partial perforations were included).
 In none of these cases was patient treatment altered by the additional information provided by the second and third injections.
 This false-negative rate is significantly lower than that reported previously and raises the question of whether there are circumstances in which the easier and less time-consuming single radiocarpal injection might be appropriate.

225,"Nuclear shape as a prognostic discriminant in colorectal carcinoma.
 In search for a more reliable prognostic discriminant, a retrospective analysis of 100 cases of colorectal carcinoma having undergone curative resection and followed for at least 5 years were assessed by nuclear morphometry.
 Each case was staged according to the Dukes' classification as well as graded histologically.
 For all patients in this series, the perimeter, area, and nuclear shape factor of 50 interphase nuclei were determined for each carcinoma.
 The information was obtained through the use of an image analysis system by tracing the nuclear profiles (magnification 1000x) as digitized on a video screen.
 The nuclear shape factor was defined as the degree of circularity of the nucleus, a perfect circle recorded as 1.0.
 A nuclear shape factor greater than 0.84 was associated with poor outcome.
 Multiple regression models showed that the single nuclear parameter of the shape factor was the most highly significant predictor of survival (P less than 0.0001).
 This variable remained highly significant even when corrected for sex, age, histologic grade, and Dukes' classification.
 These findings indicate that a nuclear shape factor greater than or equal to 0.84 as determined by nuclear morphometry is an independent morphometric nuclear variable of great importance in the prognosis of large bowel carcinoma.

 Twenty-five patients with myocardial infarction were monitored in the acute phase and during follow-up with regard to the in vivo production of prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TxA2), by measurement of their major urinary metabolites, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-TxB2, respectively.
 In 22 of these patients PGI2 and TxA2 production were also assessed before, during and after an exercise test performed 6 weeks after discharge.
 In approximately 24% of patients the in vivo production of prostacyclin did not increase during the acute phase of the infarction process.
 This inability was usually associated with a decrease in the release of heart muscle enzymes, and was mostly frequently observed in women.
 During the exercise tolerance test, none of the patients showed any increase in prostacyclin production, in contrast to healthy volunteers, in whom a significant increase was seen.
 There were no differences between patients with and without an increase in prostacyclin production during the acute phase.
 At the follow-up 2 years after the myocardial infarction, eight cardiac events had occurred, all of which were noted among patients who exhibited an expected increase in prostacyclin production in association with the infarction.
 This would seem reasonable, since most of the patients in this group had larger primary infarctions.

 The lysosomal storage disorder glycogenosis type II is caused by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency.
 In this study we have investigated the possible applicability of mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated enzyme replacement therapy to correct the enzyme deficiency in the most affected tissues.
 Bovine testes acid alpha-glucosidase containing phosphorylated mannose residues was intravenously administered to mice and found to be taken up by heart (70% increase of activity) and skeletal muscle (43% increase); the major target organs.
 The uptake of nonphosphorylated human placenta acid alpha-glucosidase by heart and skeletal muscle appeared to be significantly less efficient, whereas uptake of dephosphorylated bovine testes enzyme was not detectable.
 The phosphorylated bovine testes acid alpha-glucosidase remained present in mouse skeletal muscle up to 9-15 d after administration, with a half-life of 2-4 d.
 Besides being measured in skeletal muscle and heart, uptake of phosphorylated bovine testes and nonphosphorylated human placenta acid alpha-glucosidase was measured in several other organs, but not in brain.
 The increase of acid alpha-glucosidase activity was highest in liver and spleen.
 We concluded that application of mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated enzyme replacement therapy may offer new perspectives for treatment of glycogenesis type II.

 Although there is some evidence that physical activity may decrease blood pressure in young and middle-aged women, the physical activity-blood pressure association in older women has rarely been studied.
 As part of an ongoing community-based study of chronic disease, 641 Caucasian women between the ages of 50 and 89 years had blood pressure measured following the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program protocol.
 They also answered selected Health Interview Survey questions about their leisure-time activity and were classified into categories of light (58%), moderate (24%), heavy (6%), or no physical activity (12%) by the estimated metabolic rate required for each activity.
 Women who engaged in any physical activity were significantly younger and thinner than sedentary women and had lower fasting and 2-hour postchallenge insulin levels.
 They did not differ in alcohol consumption, cigarette use, or prevalence of coronary heart disease or diabetes.
 Rates of systolic and diastolic hypertension were significantly lower in women participating in light, moderate, or heavy physical activity compared with sedentary women.
 Blood pressure levels decreased with each increase in reported activity intensity (p less than 0.005 for trend), with systolic blood pressure approximately 20 mm Hg lower in the heaviest activity group compared with systolic blood pressure in sedentary women.
 Intergroup differences remained statistically significant after adjustment for age and body mass index.
 Although physical activity was associated with lower fasting and 2-hour postchallenge insulin levels (p less than 0.01 for trend), adjustment for insulin levels did not alter blood pressure differences among activity groups.

 Between 1973 and 1985, total age-adjusted cancer incidence in the United States (all races, men and women) rose by 10.7%, with an average annual percentage change of +0.9%.
 Analysis of reported age-specific incidence of primary malignant brain tumors over the same years demonstrates that incidence rates increased dramatically between 1973/1974 and 1985.
 In 1985, incidence rates for persons aged 75-79, 80-84, and 85 years of age and over were 187%, 394%, and 501%, respectively, of rates in 1973/1974.
 Similar increases were found in both men and women, analyzed separately and combined.
 Average annual percentage changes in primary brain tumor incidence were +7.0%, +20.4%, and +23.4% in these age ranges, respectively.
 Reported incidence in younger persons varied little over the same period of time.
 The most common histologic type of primary brain tumor in the elderly was of glial origin, predominantly the glioblastoma multiforme and astrocytoma.
 These tumors are highly malignant and invariably fatal.
 Two possible causes may explain the increased incidence in the elderly: the introduction and extensive use of x-ray computed tomography since 1973 and/or a true increase in incidence occurring independently of diagnostic advances.

 To investigate the potential role of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) in patients receiving intensive cytotoxic therapy, we measured the endogenous levels of Epo in 31 patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT).
 Seventeen patients underwent allogeneic BMT and 14 underwent autologous BMT.
 On average, 10 +/- 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs) were transfused per patient.
 The mean RBC transfusion requirement of the autologous BMT patients was significantly greater than that of the allogeneic recipients (12 +/- 3 v 8 +/- 4, P less than .01), although both groups were maintained at comparable hematocrits.
 Epo levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA).
 For each patient, baseline serum Epo levels were determined at time of admission to the hospital.
 Subsequent samples were collected within 24 hours of completing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and on days 7, 14, and 28, after BMT.
 Hematocrits (Hcts) were measured daily.
 All patients had an initial serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL.
 Despite considerable differences in absolute Epo levels among individuals, a characteristic pattern was observed.
 Following admission to the hospital and initiation of cytotoxic therapy, the average Hct decreased and the average Epo level initially increased.
 The mean serum Epo levels peaked on day 7 post-BMT (284 +/- 190 mU/mL) and fell steadily thereafter.
 While the average Hcts on day 7 and on day 28 post-BMT were not significantly different (28 +/- 4.6% v 29 +/- 3.3%, respectively), the average serum Epo levels decreased fourfold (P less than .01) during this same period.
 Moreover, day 28 post-BMT mean Epo levels were inappropriately low (P less than .05) when compared with a reference population with bone marrow failure and normal controls who had not received cytotoxic therapy.
 We conclude that the endogenous Epo response appears to be blunted during the 3 to 4 weeks immediately post-BMT.
 Therefore, clinical trials assessing the efficacy of the administration of rhEpo in the treatment of anemias associated with cytotoxic therapy are warranted.

 Severe methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency with less than 2% of normal enzyme activity is characterized by neurological abnormalities, atherosclerotic changes, and thromboembolism.
 We have discovered a ""new"" variant of MTHFR deficiency which is characterized by the absence of neurological abnormalities, an enzyme activity of about 50% of the normal value, and distinctive thermolability under specific conditions of heat inactivation.
 In this study, lymphocyte MTHFR specific activities in the thermolabile variant and control groups were 5.58 +/- 0.91 and 10.33 +/- 2.89 nmol formaldehyde formed/mg protein/h, respectively.
 The difference was significant (P less than .01).
 However, there was overlap among the individual values from the two groups.
 On the other hand, residual MTHFR activity after heat inactivation was 11.2 +/- 1.43% in the thermolabile variant and 36.3 +/- 5.18% in the controls.
 There was no overlap.
 Enzyme studies in 10 subjects with thermolabile MTHFR and their family members support the hypothesis that thermolabile MTHFR is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.
 To elucidate the association of thermolabile MTHFR with the development of coronary artery disease, we determined the thermostability of lymphocyte MTHFR in 212 patients with proven coronary artery disease and in 202 controls without clinical evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease.
 Thermolabile MTHFR was found in 36 (17.0%) cardiac patients and 10 (5.0%) controls.
 The difference in incidence between the two groups was statistically significant (P less than .01).
 The average age at onset of clinical coronary artery disease in 36 patients with thermolabile MTHFR was 57.3 +/- 7.6 years (35-72 years).
 The mean total plasma homocysteine concentration in patients with thermolabile MTHFR was 13.19 +/- 5.32 nmol/ml and was significantly different from the normal mean of 8.50 +/- 2.80 nmol/ml (P less than .05).
 There was no association between thermolabile MTHFR and other major risk factors.
 We conclude that thermolabile MTHFR is a variant(s) of MTHFR deficiency which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.
 In addition, it is positively associated with the development of coronary artery disease.
 Determination of in vitro thermostability of lymphocyte MTHFR is a reliable method for identifying subjects with this abnormality.

 Toxic epidermal necrolysis is perhaps the most formidable disease encountered by dermatologists.
 Uncommon but not rare, toxic epidermal necrolysis occurs in 60 to 70 persons per year in France.
 It remains as puzzling a disorder as it was 34 years ago, when described by Lyell.
 Whether or not toxic epidermal necrolysis is the most severe form of erythema multiforme is still the subject of discussion.
 The physiopathologic events that lead to this rapidly extensive necrosis of the epidermis are not understood.
 Indirect evidence suggests a hypersensitivity reaction, but the search for potential immunologic mechanisms has resulted in little data to support this hypothesis.
 Accumulated clinical evidence points to drugs as the most important, if not the only, cause of toxic epidermal necrolysis.
 Sulfonamides, especially long-acting forms, anticonvulsants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and certain antibiotics are associated with most cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis.
 Many other drugs have been implicated in isolated case reports.
 All organs may be involved either by the same process of destruction of the epithelium as observed in the epidermis or by the same systemic consequences of ""acute skin failure"" as seen in patients with widespread burns.
 Sepsis is the most important complication and cause of death.
 Approximately 20% to 30% of all patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis die.
 Elderly patients and patients with extensive lesions have a higher mortality rate.
 Surviving patients completely heal in 3 to 4 weeks, but up to 50% will have residual, potentially disabling ocular lesions.
 The prognosis is improved by adequate therapy, as provided in burn units, that is, aggressive fluid replacement, nutritional support, and a coherent antibacterial policy.

239,"Health perceptions and survival: do global evaluations of health status really predict mortality?
 Self-evaluations of health status have been shown to predict mortality, above and beyond the contribution to prediction made by indices based on the presence of health problems, physical disability, and biological or life-style risk factors.
 Several possible reasons for this association are discussed: (a) methodological shortcomings of previous studies render the association spurious; (b) other psychosocial influences on mortality are involved and explain the association; and (c) self-evaluations of health status have a direct and independent effect of their own.
 Four-year follow-up mortality data from the Yale Health and Aging Project (N = 2812) are used to explore these possibilities.
 The analysis controls for the contribution of numerous indicators of health problems, disability and risk factors, and also makes adjustments of standard errors for the complex sample design.
 The findings favor the third possibility, an independent effect, to the extent that the particular set of psychosocial factors examined did not explain the basic association, and to the extent that the control variables were an adequately comprehensive set.

 Treatment of hypertension may prevent many of the complications attributable to blood pressure elevation, particularly those that are ""pressure-related,"" such as stroke.
 However, the atherosclerotic complications of hypertension, e.g., coronary artery disease manifested as coronary morbidity and mortality, have not been reduced significantly with antihypertensive therapy.
 This disappointing outcome may reflect the adverse metabolic effects of the traditional therapies, diuretics and beta blockers, and their lack of specific vasoprotective properties.
 Increasing attention is thus being paid to the newer antihypertensive agents, which typically have fewer adverse effects and perhaps more physiologic mechanisms of antihypertensive action.
 Since calcium plays a key role in the genesis of atherosclerosis, calcium antagonists may positively affect the course of vascular disease.
 Investigators have observed that calcium antagonists display clear antiatherosclerotic properties in experimental as well as clinical studies.
 In one recently published clinical study, coronary artery disease was shown to develop more slowly, with a slower progression of individual stenoses, higher regression rate and less frequent occurrence of new lesions in patients treated chronically with verapamil compared to those receiving conventional therapies.
 Other similar investigations are currently under way to evaluate the antiatherogenic properties of calcium antagonists, including the Frankfurt Isoptin Progression Study (FIPS), the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), the International Nifedipine Trial on Atherosclerosis Coronary Therapy (INTACT), and the large-scale Montreal Heart Institute Study.
 Results of these studies, which use precise end points such as myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction and peripheral vascular disease, may revolutionize the treatment of hypertension by identifying therapeutic approaches that control both the pressure-related and atherosclerotic complications of the disease.

 Adenosine influences the function of several cell types thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial reperfusion injury.
 We have previously demonstrated that intracoronary administration of adenosine enhances myocardial salvage 24 hours after reperfusion.
 To determine if these beneficial effects could be obtained during a prolonged period of reperfusion using an intravenous route of administration, 22 closed-chest dogs were subjected to 90 minutes of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 72 hours of reperfusion.
 Animals randomly received either intravenous adenosine (0.15 mg/kg/min) or an equal volume of Ringer's lactate during the first 150 minutes of reperfusion.
 The area at risk was defined in vivo with Monastral blue, and infarct size was measured histologically with Mallory's trichrome stain.
 Serial global and regional ventricular function were determined with contrast ventriculography and analyzed using a computerized radial shortening method.
 Biopsies were obtained from the central ischemic zone to assess endothelial ultrastructure and capillary obstruction.
 No significant effects in heart rate or blood pressure were noted during adenosine infusion.
 Transmural collateral blood flow during ischemia was similar in the groups.
 Infarct size expressed as a percentage of the anatomical area at risk was significantly less in the adenosine-treated group (35.3 +/- 4.3% in controls versus 17.1 +/- 4.3% in treated animals, p less than 0.01).
 A progressive decrease in transmural blood flow was noted in control animals during reperfusion, resulting in a significant reduction at 3 hours compared with the preocclusion value (0.69 +/- 0.11 ml/min/g [at baseline versus 0.45 +/- 0.10 ml/min/g at 3 hours, p less than 0.05]).
 In contrast, flow in adenosine animals at 3 hours was similar to baseline values (0.91 +/- 0.15 ml/min/g at baseline versus 0.98 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g at 3 hours, p = NS) and was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than the control group.

 Bilateral simultaneous sampling of the inferior petrosal sinuses is an extremely sensitive, specific, and accurate test for diagnosing Cushing disease and distinguishing between that entity and the ectopic ACTH syndrome.
 It is also valuable for lateralizing small hormone-producing adenomas within the pituitary gland.
 The inferior petrosal sinuses connect the cavernous sinuses with the ipsilateral internal jugular veins.
 The anatomy of the anastomoses between the inferior petrosal sinus, the internal jugular vein, and the venous plexuses at the base of the skull varies, but it is almost always possible to catheterize the inferior petrosal sinus.
 In addition, variations in size and anatomy are often present between the two inferior petrosal sinuses in a patient.
 Advance preparation is required for petrosal sinus sampling.
 Teamwork is a critical element, and each member of the staff should know what he or she will be doing during the procedure.
 The samples must be properly labeled, processed, and stored.
 Specific needles, guide wires, and catheters are recommended for this procedure.
 The procedure is performed with specific attention to the three areas of potential technical difficulty: catheterization of the common femoral veins, crossing the valve at the base of the left internal jugular vein, and selective catheterization of the inferior petrosal sinuses.
 There are specific methods for dealing with each of these areas.
 The sine qua non of correct catheter position in the inferior petrosal sinus is demonstration of reflux of contrast material into the ipsilateral cavernous sinus.
 Images must always be obtained to document correct catheter position.
 Special attention must be paid to two points to prevent potential complications: The patient must be given an adequate dose of heparin, and injection of contrast material into the inferior petrosal sinuses and surrounding veins must be done gently and carefully.
 When the procedure is performed as outlined, both inferior petrosal sinuses can be catheterized in more than 98% of patients.

247,"Hyperprolactinemia increases and hypoprolactinemia decreases tyrosine hydroxylase messenger ribonucleic acid levels in the arcuate nuclei, but not the substantia nigra or zona incerta.
 The effects of experimentally produced hypoprolactinemia and hyperprolactinemia on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA signal levels were examined in dopaminergic neurons ovariectomized rats.
 TH mRNA signal levels and relative TH quantity in the arcuate nuclei, zona incerta, and substantia nigra were evaluated by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, respectively.
 The catalytic activity of TH in the stalk-median eminence (SME) was determined from the in vitro rate of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) accumulation after inhibiting DOPA decarboxylase with brocresine.
 Chronic administration of bromocriptine (BROMO), a dopamine (DA) agonist, for 3 days reduced circulating rat PRL (rPRL) levels compared to those in the vehicle-treated controls.
 BROMO treatment decreased TH mRNA signal levels in the arcuate nuclei, the intensity of TH immunostaining in the arcuate-median eminence area, and the rate of DOPA accumulation in the SME.
 Concomitant administration of ovine PRL (oPRL) reversed the effects of BROMO on TH, resulting in markedly increased TH mRNA signal levels, intensity of TH immunostaining, and rate of DOPA accumulation.
 Treatment with oPRL by itself for 3 days increased TH mRNA signal levels in the arcuate nuclei and TH activity in the SME, compared to vehicle.
 Chronic treatment with haloperidol, a DA antagonist, increased circulating levels of endogenous rPRL and increased TH activity in the SME to values similar to those after oPRL treatment.
 However, in contrast to oPRL, mRNA levels in the arcuate nuclei of haloperidol-treated rats were similar to levels in vehicle-treated animals.
 To evaluate whether the effect of PRL on TH was species specific, oPRL or rPRL was continuously infused into the jugular vein using an osmotic minipump.
 TH mRNA levels in the arcuate nuclei were elevated above control levels by either oPRL or rPRL administration.
 TH mRNA levels in the DA perikarya located in the zona incerta and substantia nigra were not altered by treatment with a DA agonist, a DA antagonist, or PRL.
 These results indicate that hypoprolactinemia or hyperprolactinemia can selectively reduce or augment, respectively, TH mRNA levels in the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons.
 The alterations in TH mRNA content probably contribute to the decrease or increase in TH activity associated with hypoprolactinemia or hyperprolactinemia, respectively.

249,"Immunohistologic detection of the epidermal growth factor receptor in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
 Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) expression was studied immunohistologically in 38 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
 The EGF-R was faintly expressed in basal and parabasal layers of normal esophageal epithelia and in cancer nests of 20 patients; it was strongly expressed in all areas of dysplastic epithelia and in cancer nests of 18 patients.
 The patients with strongly expressed EGF-R had lymph node metastases more frequently, and their prognosis was poorer than those with faintly expressed EGF-R.
 The EGF-R expression showed a mosaic pattern in 17 patients and a diffuse pattern in 21 patients.
 The patients with a mosaic pattern had lymph node metastases more frequently and a worse prognosis than those with a diffuse pattern.
 Expression of EGF-R in metastatic lymph nodes was similar to that in strongly expressing areas of primary cancers with a mosaic pattern.
 Thus EGF-R expression may be an important indicator for malignancies of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas because primary cancer cells with strongly expressed EGF-R metastasize to lymph nodes more frequently.

250,"Variability in DNA measurements in multiple tumor samples of human colonic carcinoma.
 The DNA ploidy and cell-cycle distribution of three separate fresh tissue samples of 60 colorectal adenocarcinomas were analyzed by flow cytometry.
 DNA ploidy was concordant among the three samples in 38 cases (63.3%).
 In the remaining 22 cases (36.6%), the DNA histograms of two of the three multiple samples were similar; however, the ploidy of the third sample was discordant.
 No relationship was observed between Dukes' stage and histologic grade with concordance or discordance among samples.
 Thus, in about one third of the colonic carcinomas, a single sample showing either a diploid or diploid-cycling DNA histogram would not detect aneuploid DNA patterns.
 Comparison of scrapes and fine-needle aspirates of tumors as alternative sampling methods of tumors for DNA ploidy analysis indicated a strong association with the tumor ploidy (84% and 96%, respectively) only when the ploidy of the multiple samples was concordant.
 In about 25% of the cases, tumor scrapes and fine-needle aspirates did not correlate with the ""most abnormal"" ploidy observed in one of the three tissue samples.
 The data suggest that single or even double tissue samples may not show aneuploid DNA patterns in a substantial proportion of colorectal cancers.

251,"Vascular renin and hypertension. Uptake versus synthesis.
 Conventional radioimmunoassay techniques demonstrated in the aortic wall a renin-like activity which is derived from plasma but has a longer half-life than plasma renin.
 Blood pressure elevation after renin injection into nephrectomized rats correlates better with aortic renin than with plasma renin.
 Vascular and other extrarenal tissue can also synthesize renin.
 Using a ribonuclease protection technique for the detection of renin messenger RNA we have been able to demonstrate that a wide variety of extrarenal tissues contain the renin message.
 In at least two of these, the brain and the liver, renin messenger RNA levels are unaffected by changes in dietary salt or by changes in systemic blood pressure.
 Functional studies using isolated human resistance vessels also demonstrate the presence of renin-like activity by a contractile response to added renin substrate.
 It is suggested that extrarenal tissues therefore contain renin-like activity derived both from uptake and from local synthesis.
 These systems may be regulated in different ways and may carry out different functions.

252,"Interaction of the v-rel protein with an NF-kappa B DNA binding site.
 The avian reticuloendotheliosis virus T contains within its genome the oncogene rel.
 The expression of this gene is responsible for the induction of lymphoid tumors in birds.
 Recently, the rel gene was shown to be related to the p50 DNA binding subunit of the transcription factor complex NF-kappa B.
 Binding sites for the NF-kappa B complex are found in the enhancer regions of a number of genes, including the immunoglobulin kappa gene and the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat.
 In this communication we identify an activity from avian reticuloendotheliosis virus T-transformed avian lymphoid cells that binds in an electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay to an NF-kappa B binding site from the kappa enhancer.
 This activity contains proteins immunologically related to rel, as detected by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against v-rel.
 In a DNA affinity precipitation assay using the NF-kappa B site from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat, v-rel and several other proteins were identified.
 These data suggest that oncogenic transformation by v-rel is the result of an altered pattern of gene expression.

254,"Xanthine oxidase inhibition does not limit canine infarct size.
 BACKGROUND.
 Evidence supporting the role of xanthine oxidase in myocardial reperfusion injury is based on studies with pharmacological interventions used to inhibit enzyme function.
 Controversy exists, however, regarding the true role of xanthine oxidase in reperfusion injury.
 This study was performed to determine whether xanthine oxidase inhibition limits myocardial injury due to coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Anesthetized dogs underwent coronary artery occlusion (90 minutes) and reperfusion (6 hours).
 Oxypurinol (28 mg/kg) or amflutizole (30 mg/kg), chemically unrelated inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, or vehicle was infused intravenously 15 minutes before and 3 hours after reperfusion.
 Regional myocardial blood flow was determined with radiolabeled microspheres.
 Infarct size was determined with the tetrazolium method.
 Myocardial infarct size (percent of risk region) was less in oxypurinol-treated dogs, 32 +/- 16%, compared with that of the control group, 46 +/- 15%.
 Infarct size for the amflutizole-treated dogs, 40 +/- 21%, was not significantly different from that of the control group.
 There were no differences in rate-pressure product or collateral blood flow to account for differences in infarct size.
 Uric acid concentration in the coronary venous plasma increased after reperfusion in the dogs treated with vehicle but not in the drug-treated dogs.
 Xanthine oxidase inhibition was demonstrated in each of the drug treatment groups, but only oxypurinol limited the extent of myocardial injury.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Previously reported cardioprotective effects of allopurinol, noted to occur only when the drug was administered chronically, may be related to a property of oxypurinol, a major metabolite of allopurinol.
 The beneficial effect of oxypurinol is unrelated to inhibition of superoxide formation during xanthine oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of xanthine and hypoxanthine.

255,"Expression of VHIII-associated cross-reactive idiotype on human B lymphocytes. Association with staphylococcal protein A binding and Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I stimulation.
 It has been demonstrated that staphylococcal protein A (SPA) has an ""alternative"" binding site with specificity for human Ig H chain V region of the VHIII subgroup.
 Because the major mitogenic component of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) is SPA, it is possible that SAC stimulates a subpopulation of B cells expressing Ig of the VHIII H chain subgroup.
 In the present study, we have investigated further the relationship between SPA binding and the expression of VHI- or VHIII-associated cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) on the surface of tonsillar B lymphocytes enriched for the expression or nonexpression of the CRI, and we examined the Ig secreted by cell lines established from these populations of B cells by EBV transformation.
 The VHIII CRI (D12)-enriched population yielded 21 cell lines, with 67% of them secreting SPA-reactive Ig; in contrast, only 6% (1 of 16) of VHI CRI-expressing lines secreted SPA-reactive Ig.
 The CRI-negative B cell population yielded 54 cell lines, of which 20% secreted SPA-reactive Ig, as might be anticipated because a majority of VHIII Ig+ B cells will be CRI-.
 SAC stimulation of CRI+ and CRI- populations showed preferential stimulation of the D12 population.
 These data support the proposal that SAC stimulation of human B cells is mediated through binding of SPA by its alternative binding site to IgV regions of the VHIII subgroup.

 Performance was not related to hearing sensitivity, thus suggesting that changes in the auditory mechanism that occur with age may encompass more than a loss of hearing sensitivity.
 Moreover, performance on the Repetition Test did correlate with memory for digits, which indicates a relationship between auditory processing and higher cortical functions.

258,"Free radical-derived quinone methide mediates skin tumor promotion by butylated hydroxytoluene hydroperoxide: expanded role for electrophiles in multistage carcinogenesis.
 Free radical derivatives of peroxides, hydroperoxides, and anthrones are thought to mediate tumor promotion by these compounds.
 Further, the promoting activity of phorbol esters is attributed, in part, to their ability to stimulate the cellular generation of oxygen radicals.
 A hydroperoxide metabolite of butylated hydroxytoluene, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroperoxyl-4-methyl-2,5-cyclohexadienone (BHTOOH), has previously been shown to be a tumor promoter in mouse skin.
 BHTOOH is extensively metabolized by murine keratinocytes to several radical species.
 The primary radical generated from BHTOOH is a phenoxyl radical that can disproportionate to form butylated hydroxytoluene quinone methide, a reactive electrophile.
 Since electrophilic species have not been previously postulated to mediate tumor promotion, the present study was undertaken to examine the role of this electrophile in the promoting activity of BHTOOH.
 The biological activities of two chemical analogs of BHTOOH, 4-trideuteromethyl-BHTOOH and 4-tert-butyl-BHTOOH, were compared with that of the parent compound.
 4-Trideuteromethyl-BHTOOH and 4-tert-butyl-BHTOOH have a reduced ability or inability, respectively, to form a quinone methide; however, like the parent compound, they both generate a phenoxyl radical when incubated with keratinocyte cytosol.
 The potency of BHTOOH, 4-trideuteromethyl-BHTOOH, and 4-tert-butyl-BHTOOH as inducers of ornithine decarboxylase, a marker of tumor promotion, was commensurate with their capacity for generating butylated hydroxytoluene quinone methide.
 These initial results were confirmed in a two-stage tumor promotion protocol in female SENCAR mice.
 Together, these data indicate that a quinone methide is mediating tumor promotion by BHTOOH, providing direct evidence that an electrophilic intermediate can elicit this stage of carcinogenesis.

 With the reduction in profile of balloon dilation catheters, until recently, it has been the internal dimensions and performance of the guiding catheter that has mandated the use of 7, 8 or 9 French (F) systems for the performance of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).
 A new 5F catheter design (Sherwood Medical Co., St.
 Louis, MO) provided a large inner lumen (0.4"") permitting use of 0.20-0.22"" fixed-wire PTCA balloon catheters with good coronary visualization.
 Potential advantages include reduced coronary artery ostial trauma and catheter induced damping and enhanced patient comfort.
 We report our initial experience in 14 patients undergoing PTCA with a 5 and 6F guide/fixed-wire system.
 Mean age was 63 +/- 10 (43-78 years).
 PTCA indications: Cardiogenic shock (1), post-myocardial infarction angina pectoris (2), grade III angina (5) and unstable angina pectoris (6).
 Vessel attempted: Left anterior descending (3), circumflex (4), obtuse marginal (2), diagonal (1), right coronary artery (3), and internal thoracic artery (1).

 Staging systems for breast cancer, unlike those of neoplasms in distant or recessed sites, allowed for the early development of clinical staging evaluation.
 It was established that clinical assessment of the breast lesion was often wrong compared with the pathologic examination (benign vs.
 malignant); clinical measurement of the tumor in centimeters was often larger than histologic size; and clinical assessment of axillary nodes (clear or metastatic) was incorrect in about 30% of cases.
 Although both clinical and pathologic staging provide effective discriminants for prognosis of treated patients, prognosis is more accurately determined by the pathologic stage.
 The single most important prognostic indicator is the axillary nodal status, and when positive, the number of positive nodes.
 The American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union International Contra Cancer have agreed on a TNM staging for breast carcinoma, and this is the preferable staging system.
 Follow-up of treated patients is of most value in detecting local recurrence on the chest wall (after mastectomy) or in the irradiated breast (after lumpectomy), and also in early detection of contralateral breast cancer.
 Physical examination and periodic mammography are most useful.

 The outcome 1 year after they had sustained a severe head injury was investigated in patients who were admitted to the neurosurgery service at one of four centers participating in the Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB).
 Of 300 eligible survivors, the quality of recovery 1 year after injury was assessed by at least the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) in 263 patients (87%), whereas complete neuropsychological assessment was performed in 127 (42%) of the eligible survivors.
 The capacity of the patients to undergo neuropsychological testing 1 year after injury was a criterion of recovery as reflected by a significant relationship to neurological indices of acute injury and the GOS score at the time of hospital discharge.
 The neurobehavioral data at 1 year after injury were generally comparable across the four samples of patients and characterized by impairment of memory and slowed information processing.
 In contrast, language and visuospatial ability recovered to within the normal range.
 The lowest postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and pupillary reactivity were predictive of the 1-year GOS score and neuropsychological performance.
 The lowest GCS score was especially predictive of neuropsychological performance 1 year postinjury in patients who had at least one nonreactive pupil following resuscitation.
 Notwithstanding limitations related to the scope of the TCDB and attrition in follow-up material, the results indicate a characteristic pattern of neurobehavioral recovery from severe head injury and encourage the use of neurobehavioral outcome measurements in clinical trials to evaluate interventions for head-injured patients.

 During neurosurgical operations for the relief of movement disorders, single thalamic neurons (n = 107) were identified with activity which was related to verbally cued active movements (movement-related cells).
 The activity of each neuron was examined during different contralateral movements in order to determine the movement which was associated with the most consistent and pronounced change in firing rate (the optimal response).
 The optimal response was determined by analysis of histograms of neuronal activity which were constructed by using the onset of EMG activity to synchronize successive repetitions of the active movement.
 Movement-related cells exhibited optimal responses associated with such movements as making a fist, extension or flexion of the wrist, flexing or extending the elbow, pointing with the entire upper extremity, extending the tongue and lifting the leg.
 Most movement-related cells recorded in a single parasagittal plane in an individual patient had optimal responses related to movements involving the same part of the body.
 Movement-related cells were classified into those that were activated in response to somatosensory stimulation (combined cells, n = 20) and those which were not (voluntary cells, n = 87).
 Combined cells were activated in advance of EMG activity during active movement and so could be distinguished from cells responding only to sensory stimulation (sensory cells).
 Movement-related cells (combined and voluntary cell types) were located anterior to sensory cells and tended to show a mediolateral somatotopic organization parallel to that of sensory cells with cutaneous receptive fields.
 Combined cells responded to somatosensory stimulation of the same part of the body as that involved in the active movement related to the optimal response of the cell.
 Combined cells responding to passive movements of a joint always had their optimal response during active movement about the same joint.

 We evaluated the efficacy of scanning with 123I-labeled Tyr3-octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, for tumor localization in 42 patients with carcinoid tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or paragangliomas.
 We then evaluated the response to octreotide therapy in some of these patients.
 RESULTS.
 Primary tumors or metastases, often previously unrecognized, were visualized in 12 of 13 patients with carcinoid tumors and in 7 of 9 patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors.
 The endocrine symptoms of these patients responded well to therapy with octreotide.
 Among 20 patients with paragangliomas, 8 of whom had more than one tumor, 10 temporal (tympanic or jugular), 9 carotid, and 10 vagal tumors could be visualized.
 One small tympanic tumor and one small carotid tumor were not seen on the scan.

 Although limitations of electrogram analysis exist and are discussed, careful analysis and registration of electrograms during all supraventricular and ventricular rhythms observed during in-hospital testing served as an important reference for subsequent arrhythmia diagnosis.
 By analyzing the electrogram rate and RR interval stability and configuration, a definitive diagnosis was established in all three patients (atrial fibrillation, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and rate-sensing lead disruption, respectively).

 The carrier frequency for Tay-Sachs disease is significantly elevated in both the Ashkenazi Jewish and Moroccan Jewish populations but not in other Jewish groups.
 We have found that the mutations underlying Tay-Sachs disease in Ashkenazi and Moroccan Jews are different.
 Analysis of a Moroccan Jewish Tay-Sachs patient had revealed an in-frame deletion (delta F) of one of the two adjacent phenylalanine codons that are present at positions 304 and 305 in the alpha-subunit sequence.
 The mutation impairs the subunit assembly of beta-hexosaminidase A, resulting in an absence of enzyme activity.
 The Moroccan patient was found also to carry, in the other alpha-subunit allele, a different, and as yet unidentified, mutation which causes a deficit of mRNA.

 To test the hypothesis that the combined use of the time-varying elastance concept and conventional circumferential stress-shortening relations would elucidate differential mechanisms for left ventricular systolic dysfunction in severe, chronic aortic regurgitation and therefore predict the functional responses to aortic valve replacement, 31 control patients and 37 patients with aortic regurgitation were studied.
 The studies included micromanometer left ventricular pressure determinations, biplane contrast cineangiograms under control conditions and radionuclide angiograms under control conditions and during methoxamine or nitroprusside infusions with right atrial pacing.
 The patients with aortic regurgitation were classified into three groups: Group I had normal Emax and stress-shortening relations, Group II had abnormal Emax but normal stress-shortening relations and Group III had abnormal Emax and stress-shortening relations.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes showed a progressive increase and the ejection fraction showed a progressive decrease from Group I to III; these values differed from those in the control patients (p less than 0.001).
 In Group I, there was a decrease in left ventricular volumes (p less than 0.05) but no significant change in ejection fraction (61 +/- 7% versus 63 +/- 4%) after aortic valve replacement.
 In contrast, in Group II, reduction in left ventricular volumes (p less than 0.01) was associated with an increase in ejection fraction from 50 +/- 8% to 64 +/- 11% (p less than 0.01).
 Finally, in Group III, reduction in left ventricular volumes (p less than 0.05) was associated with a further decrement in ejection fraction from 35 +/- 13% to 30 +/- 13%.
 Group I patients had compensated adequately for chronic volume overload.
 However, Group II had left ventricular dysfunction that was associated with an increase in the left ventricular volume/mass ratio compared with that in the control patients and Group I (p less than 0.05 for both), suggesting inadequate hypertrophy and assumption of spherical geometry.
 Finally, irreversible myocardial dysfunction had supervened in Group III.
 In conclusion, a combined analysis of left ventricular chamber performance using the time-varying elastance concept and myocardial performance using conventional circumferential stress-shortening relations provides complementary information that elucidates differential mechanisms for left ventricular systolic dysfunction and therefore predicts the functional response to aortic valve replacement.

273,"Screening of nineteen unrelated families with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone for known point mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene and the detection of a new mutation.
 Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) is a syndrome characterized by impaired tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone.
 Two distinct point mutations in the hormone binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta have recently been identified in two unrelated families with GRTH.
 One, Mf, involves a replacement of the normal glycine-345 for arginine in exon 7 and another, Mh, replaces the normal proline-453 for histidine in exon 8.
 To probe for the presence of the Mf and Mh defect in 19 unrelated families with GRTH, we applied separate polymerase chain reactions using allele-specific oligonucleotide primers containing the normal and each of the two mutant nucleotides at the 3'-position.
 A total of 24 affected subjects and 13 normal family members were studied.
 The mode of inheritance was dominant in 13 families, was unknown in 5 families, and was clearly recessive in 1 family in which only the consanguineous subjects were affected.
 Primers containing the substitutions specific for Mf and Mh amplified exons 7 and 8, respectively, only in affected members of each of the two index families.
 Primers containing the normal sequences amplified exons 7 and 8 of the TR beta gene in all subjects except affected members of one family.
 In this family with recessively inherited GRTH, neither exon could be amplified using any combinations of primers and DNA blot revealed absence of all coding exons.
 These results indicate a major deletion of the TR beta gene, including both DNA and hormone binding domains.
 Since heterozygous members of this family are not affected, the presence of a single normal allele is sufficient for normal function of the TR beta.
 These data also support the hypothesis that in the dominant mode of GRTH inheritance the presence of an abnormal TR beta interferes with the function of the normal TR beta.
 Distinct mutations are probably responsible for GRTH in unrelated families.

274,"Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders. Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment.
 In this report, we discuss the definition, characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatment of tic disorders with a major emphasis on Tourette syndrome.
 Although the diagnosis of a tic disorder depends on the presence of motor and/or phonic tic(s), patients with these problems also have a variety of co-morbid features including obsessive-compulsive symptoms, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, behavioral difficulties, and learning disabilities.
 Conservative estimates for Tourette syndrome suggest a prevalence rate of 0.1-1.0 per 1000.
 This syndrome is inherited in a sex-influenced autosomal dominant pattern with either chronic multiple tic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder as alternative phenotypes of the putative gene.
 Current evidence continues to support a pathophysiologic mechanism involving synaptic neurotransmission, with the dopaminergic system as a primary candidate.
 Therapeutically, it is essential to clarify whether a patient's problems are related to tics or associated behavioral difficulties.
 Pharmacotherapy for motor and phonic tics is strictly symptomatic and should be reserved for those with functionally disabling symptoms.
 A comprehensive individualized treatment program is often required in the care of individuals with tic disorders.

 Fifty-two patients with axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis were treated in the last 10 years and were available for follow-up for at least 1 year.
 Eighteen of these were treated in the first 5 years, Group A, and 34 in the last 5 years, Group B.
 The causes in both Group A and Group B included respectively: effort or spontaneous 28 per cent and 29 per cent, catheter insertion related 17 per cent and 47 per cent, and malignancy or systemic disease 55 per cent and 24 per cent.
 None of the patients in Group A had noninvasive vascular testing (NIT).
 However, 27 patients in Group B had IPG/duplex imaging (NIT).
 All 18 cases in Group A and 27 cases in Group B were treated conventionally (anticoagulants).
 Seventy-three per cent of these had residual pain on exertion (venous claudication) and/or swelling.
 Fourteen of these cases had posttreatment NIT/venography.
 Four of these showed total resolution of the thrombus and all were symptom free.
 Ten had no resolution, and nine were symptomatic.
 Seven cases in Group B were treated with thrombolytic therapy.
 Five of these had total resolution of thrombus and were symptom free (71%).
 Two had no resolution with residual symptoms (29%) (statistically significant).
 In conclusion (1) More patients with axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis seen recently are catheter insertion related; 2) Diagnosis should be initiated with duplex imaging; and (3) Thrombolytic therapy significantly decreased residual symptoms and yielded better resolution than anticoagulants.

276,"Characterization of auscultatory gaps with wideband external pulse recording.
 Three types of auscultatory gaps, called G1, G2, and G3, that occur during blood pressure measurement have been identified by using wideband external pulse recording.
 We have previously shown that the wideband external pulse recorded during cuff deflation can be separated into three components (K1, K2, and K3), one of which (K2) is closely related to the Korotkoff sound.
 G1 occurs with cuff pressure just below systolic and is characterized by the presence of K1 and K2 with intermittent disappearance of K2.
 G1 gaps are related to a phasic decrease of arterial (systolic) pressure and were exhibited by 13 of 60 hypertensive patients.
 G2 gaps are related to a phasic increase of arterial (diastolic) pressure, occur when cuff pressure is just above diastolic, and are characterized by the presence of K1, K2, and K3 with intermittent disappearance of K2.
 Seven of 60 hypertensive patients exhibited a G2 gap.
 G3 gaps occur with cuff pressure between systolic and diastolic and are characterized by an underdeveloped or blunted K2 signal.
 Three of 60 hypertensive patients exhibited a G3 gap.
 The identification of auscultatory gaps in relation to the wideband external pulse provides a qualitative measure of their existence, can be of significant value in better understanding aspects of the auscultatory blood pressure measurement technique, and provides an objective basis with which to better understand the mechanisms that cause them.

277,"The healing of facial bone fractures by the process of secondary union.
 The mechanism of healing of facial bone fractures was investigated in a rabbit model.
 Twelve New Zealand white rabbits underwent surgically induced fractures of the right infraorbital rim and fracture ostectomies (4 to 5 mm) of the left infraorbital rim.
 Animals were sacrificed 2, 4, and 8 weeks postfracture.
 Bone, including periosteum, obtained from each fracture or fracture osteoctomy site was divided longitudinally for hematoxylin and eosin staining, fluorescent microscopy, microangiography, and microradiography.
 Sequential fluorochrome labels of oxytetracycline (30 mg/kg), alizarin complexone (30 mg/kg), DCAF (20 mg/kg), and xylenol orange (90 mg/kg) were administered 24 hours preoperatively and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks postfracture.
 All fracture and fracture ostectomy sites demonstrated vascular ingrowth, mineralization, and woven bone formation by 2 to 4 weeks postoperatively, beginning with a cartilage precursor.
 Subsequently, the woven bone was replaced with remodeled lamellar bone, resulting in complete bony healing by 8 weeks postoperatively.
 These steps were substantiated by microscopic, microradiographic, and radiologic examination of the specimens.
 This study demonstrates that fractures of the facial bones in a rabbit model heal by a process of new bone formation that resembles secondary union in endochondral bones.

 Consumption of monosodium glutamate has long been considered to precipitate headaches in susceptible patients.
 In this study the direct effects of glutamate and its metabolite, glutamine, on arterial contractility were examined using rings of rabbit aorta.
 In a high concentration glutamate caused significant concentration-dependent contractions (EC50, 10(-1)M; maximum tension, 188.4 +/- 33.3 mg wt tension/mg tissue).
 Agonists and antagonists for alpha-adrenergic, histaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and GABA-nergic receptors as well as inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis failed to influence glutamate contractions.
 At high concentrations (10(-5)M) the calcium channel blocker, verapamil, inhibited the glutamate response.
 Glutamate and glutamine both exhibited concentration dependent relaxation of norepinephrine (NE), phenylephrine (PE), histamine, serotonin (5-HT), and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha)-induced contractions.
 Kainic acid (10(-4)M), an agonist of one subpopulation of central glutamate receptor, potentiated glutamate-induced vasoconstriction; a higher concentration (10(-3)M) produced an irreversible inhibition of glutamate contractility.
 Only the central glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine (10(-4)-10(-2)M), induced a reversible, concentration dependent inhibition of glutamate-induced contractions.
 Glutamate contractility was not dependent on extracellular calcium, an intact endothelium or neuronal function.
 These results demonstrate a direct effect of glutamate on peripheral arterial tone.

279,"[Ca2+]i transients in the cardiomyopathic hamster heart.
 Intracellular [Ca2+] transients were studied in isolated hearts of healthy and cardiomyopathic hamsters in late failure perfused with glucose or pyruvate.
 Hearts of healthy hamsters developed similar pressures when perfused with either glucose or pyruvate, and [Ca2+]i transients were comparable in amplitude when perfused with either substrate.
 On the other hand, hearts of cardiomyopathic hamsters in late failure developed normal pressure when perfused with pyruvate but developed depressed pressure (50%) when perfused with glucose.
 The amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients fell severely and was associated with a high diastolic [Ca2+]i in cardiomyopathic hamster hearts when the perfusate was switched from pyruvate to glucose.
 The high phosphomonoester sugars as evidenced by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance studies and the depressed oxygen consumption in the cardiomyopathic hamster hearts perfused with glucose reflect an inhibition in glycolysis and a subsequent decrease in mitochondrial activity.
 Without an adequate delivery of substrate to the mitochondria in the cardiomyopathic hamster, the myocardium is no longer capable of maintaining its [Ca2+]i homeostasis.

 We report a retrospective study of 39 homeless men hospitalized for acute pneumonia from April 1988 to March 1989.
 All of them had recently stayed in one of two shelters.
 A Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1, resistant to cotrimoxazole, was isolated in 29 patients (74 percent).
 Blood cultures were positive in 24 (61 percent).
 The patients were relatively young; none was over 70 years old.
 Thirty-five (90 percent) were heavy smokers; 32 (82 percent) were alcoholics.
 The radiologic pattern was atypical in 14 cases (36 percent).
 The only fatal case was linked to the adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 It is likely that the rate of outbreaks of pneumococcal pneumonia is underestimated.
 The homeless are at high risk for pneumococcal pneumonia.
 In addition, the closeness existing in shelters favors the occurrence of outbreaks.
 Consequently, we suggest that shelter residents would benefit from pneumococcal vaccination.

 The Trial of Antihypertensive Interventions and Management is a multicenter randomized trial designed to examine the diastolic blood pressure response of various combinations of pharmacological and dietary interventions in the treatment of mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90-100 mm Hg).
 Eight hundred and seventy-eight participants at 110-160% of ideal weight were randomly allocated to nine drug/diet treatment groups receiving either a placebo, chlorthalidone (25 mg), or atenolol (50 mg), combined with a usual, a weight loss, or a low sodium/high potassium diet.
 The primary outcome was diastolic blood pressure change from baseline to 6 months.
 Seven hundred and eighty-seven participants had follow-up data.
 The mean baseline diastolic blood pressure was 93.8 mm Hg; 55.9% of the participants were male, and the weight loss diet group lost an average of 4.7 kg.
 Multiple comparisons were accounted for in the analysis.
 A significantly greater lowering of diastolic blood pressure (12.4 mm Hg) was achieved in the atenolol group compared with either the low sodium/high potassium diet group (7.9 mm Hg, p = 0.001) or weight loss group (8.8 mm Hg, p = 0.006).
 Adding weight loss to chlorthalidone significantly enhanced blood pressure lowering (15.1 mm Hg) when compared with the diuretic alone (10.8 mm Hg, p = 0.002), but adding a low sodium/high potassium diet (12.2 mm Hg, p = 0.029) did not.
 In the short-term treatment of mild hypertension where diastolic blood pressure is the sole consideration, drugs outperform diet, and weight loss is beneficial, especially with diuretics.

 We examined the effects of the following variables on interpleural analgesia after thoracotomy: addition of epinephrine to local anesthetic, thoracostomy drainage, two-catheter placement, and location of catheter tips.
 Twenty patients were randomized to have one catheter (paravertebral tip location) or two catheters (paravertebral and lateral thoracic wall tip locations).
 Interpleural catheters were sutured to the parietal pleura by the surgeon at time of wound closure.
 Patients were then randomly assigned to receive 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine through the single catheter or 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with or without 1:200,000 epinephrine through each of the two catheters while supine.
 Bupivacaine concentrations in whole blood and in thoracostomy drainage fluid were assayed by gas chromatography.
 Actual content of bupivacaine in the drainage fluid was calculated.
 Degree of analgesia was assessed by verbal numerical pain scores over the first 4 h and opioid demand thereafter.
 Addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine did not influence the degree of analgesia.
 Approximately 30%-40% of any administered dose of bupivacaine was lost via the thoracostomy tube over a 4-h period.
 There was no correlation between the true initial dose (100 mg minus thoracostomy drainage) and Cmax.
 Use of two catheters resulted in significantly less opioid requirements after an initial 8-h period.
 Failure to achieve adequate interpleural analgesia in postthoracotomy patients may be related to loss of anesthetic via thoracostomy drainage, presence of extravasated blood and tissue fluid in the pleural space, and possibly sequestration and channeling of flow of local anesthetic by restricted motion of an operated lung.

 Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups.
 Treatment group 1 (n = 11) received teaching, treadmill exercise testing, and exercise training (three times weekly for 5 weeks).
 Treatment group 2 (n = 15) received only teaching and exercise testing.
 The control group (n = 14) received only routine care without supervised exercise or teaching.
 Measurements of self-efficacy and activity performance were made at hospital discharge and at 4 and 9 weeks after the cardiac event.
 Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed an increase in self-efficacy scores (p less than 0.001) and performance of physical activity (p less than 0.001) for all groups.
 Both treatment groups, especially the training group, obtained the highest scores, but differences between groups were nonsignificant (p greater than 0.05).

 Cellular inhibitory activity of UCN-01 against protein kinase C and cytotoxicity of UCN-01 were compared with those of staurosporine.
 When the mechanism of inhibitory activity was investigated in vitro, UCN-01 as well as staurosporine inhibited the activity of the catalytic domain of protein kinase C.
 In spite of direct inhibition against the catalytic domain of protein kinase C, cytotoxicity of UCN-01 was much lower than that of staurosporine.
 In addition, UCN-01 showed more selective inhibitory activity against protein kinase C than did staurosporine because of the sole structural difference at C-7.
 Therefore, a series of 7-O-alkyl derivatives of UCN-01 was synthesized and investigated.
 Interestingly, one of the compounds, the beta-methoxy derivative, showed 3-fold greater potency and 17-fold more selective inhibitory activity against protein kinase C than did UCN-01.

 H1 receptor stimulation of the coronary artery was performed with a selective intracoronary infusion of histamine (2 micrograms/min) in 21 patients with variant angina after blockade of the H2 receptor with cimetidine (25 mg/kg) and its effect on the coronary artery diameter was examined.
 Intracoronary injection of acetylcholine was also performed in 19 of the 21 patients.
 Ergonovine (0.2 mg) was intravenously administered in one patient.
 The coronary artery diameter was measured with cinevideodensitometric analysis.
 A mean plasma histamine concentration in the coronary sinus increased from 4 x 10(-9) to 7 x 10(-8) M 5 min after histamine infusion into the left coronary artery (n = 18).
 Coronary spasm was induced in 6 patients (29%) with histamine, in 18 (95%) with acetylcholine and in 1 with ergonovine.

 Of the 20 coronary arteries with a normal arteriogram or a fixed stenosis less than or equal to 50% of luminal diameter, histamine decreased the diameter in 4, increased it in 14 (70%) and caused no change in 2; of the 6 coronary arteries with a fixed stenosis greater than or equal to 75%, histamine decreased the diameter in 5 and increased it in 1.

 Bacterial translocation occurs in animal models of shock, trauma, sepsis, and parenteral or elemental enteral alimentation.
 Bowel atrophy and cecal bacterial overgrowth have both been implicated in the pathophysiology of bacterial translocation in many of these models.
 To further define the etiology of bacterial translocation resulting from dietary manipulations, rats were fed a elemental/defined-formula diet (DFD) for 2 weeks ad libitum and then randomized to either intestinal decontamination with a nonabsorbable antibiotic (neomycin) or no antibiotic treatment.
 Neomycin treatment significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced the incidence of bacterial translocation after DFD, in association with a significant reduction in the number of cecal gram-negative bacteria.
 Neither loss of bowel mass after DFD nor bowel composition was affected by oral neomycin.
 Bacterial translocation after DFD would thus appear to be the result of cecal bacterial overgrowth rather than a loss of a physical intestinal barrier due to atrophy.

 OBJECTIVE--To assess the potential for increasing the yield of donors by comparing the current pattern of brain death and organ donation in a neurosurgical unit with that reported in 1981 and with a recent national audit.
 DESIGN--Retrospective review of all deaths for 1986, 1987, and 1988 and prospective data for 1989.
 SETTING--A regional neurosurgical unit serving 2.7 million population.
 RESULTS--Of 553 deaths, 35% (191) patients died while on a ventilator and 17% (92) after discontinuation of ventilation.
 Medical contraindications to donation were found in 23% (32) of 141 patients tested for brain death, in 38% (19) of 50 patients who died while being ventilated who were not tested, and in 12% (11) of 92 patients no longer being ventilated.
 Consent for donation was sought in 88% (96) of 109 medically suitable brain dead patients and granted in 70% (67) of these.
 Half those with permission for multiorgan donation had only the kidneys removed.
 CONCLUSIONS--More organs may be lost owing to transplant team logistics than by failure to seek consent from relatives of brain dead patients.
 The estimated size of the pool of potential donors depends on what types of patients might be considered.
 Ensuring that all who die while being ventilated are tested for brain death and considering the potential for donation before withdrawing ventilation could yield more donors.
 Ventilating more patients who are hopelessly brain damaged to secure more donors raises ethical and economic issues.

 Heterotopic cardiac transplantation was performed in the Lewis rat with Lewis X Brown-Norway (allografts) or Lewis (isografts) donors.
 Without immunosuppression, allografts are completely rejected in 6 to 8 days.
 At 3 days cardiac grafts were explanted and mounted on a modified Langendorff apparatus for functional measurements or submitted for pathologic examination and biochemical determination of high-energy phosphates.
 Three-day isografts (n = 9) had minimal histologic changes.
 Pathologic examination of 3-day allografts (n = 13) showed lymphocytic infiltrate and myocyte necrosis, histologic features for which antirejection treatment is usually given clinically.
 For grafts subjected to functional studies (n = 11), heart rate, cardiac output, coronary flow, and stroke work were determined at baseline and in response to isoproterenol (3 x 10(-8) mol/ml).
 Three-day allografts (n = 6) and isografts (n = 5) had similar baseline function.
 The chronotropic response to isoproterenol was similar in allografts and isografts, but allografts had diminished cardiac output and stroke work after isoproterenol.

295,"Noninvasive assessment of intrinsic ventricular load dynamics in dilated cardiomyopathy 
 On the basis of hemodynamic theory, a new noninvasive method is developed to provide improved insights into the significance of depressed Doppler left ventricular ejection variables in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
 The net force (F) associated with intraventricular flow throughout ejection can be written as: F = A.dv/dt + B.v2, where v is the ejection velocity and A and B are variables related to the geometry of the ventricle and its outflow tract.
 Instantaneous levels of this force were calculated in 9 normal subjects and 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy using Doppler, M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography.
 The maximal ejection force (Fmax) was 47.5 +/- 8.5 kdyn in normal subjects and 25.5 +/- 6.2 kdyn in those with dilated cardiomyopathy (p = 0.0001).
 Peak local acceleration and outflow velocity were severely depressed in those with cardiomyopathy compared with normal subjects (1,260 +/- 129 versus 2,671 +/- 430 cm/s2 and 71 +/- 14 versus 109 +/- 7 cm/s, respectively; p = 0.0001).
 Maximal ejection force was attained very early in ejection.
 A significant linear correlation was found between peak outflow acceleration and maximal ejection force (n = 19; r = 0.91, p = 0.0001).
 At the time of peak ejection velocity, the net force had decreased to 64% of its peak value in those with cardiomyopathy, whereas in normal subjects, it had decreased to only 84% of its peak value (p = 0.008).
 In normal subjects, the ejection force was positive during the first 75% of ejection, but in those with cardiomyopathy, it was positive only during the first 54% (p = 0.0003).
 Once its peak value was attained, total left ventricular systolic wall stress declined rapidly during ejection in normal subjects (to 33% of its peak value by end-ejection), whereas it remained elevated throughout ejection in patients with cardiomyopathy (at 60% of its peak value by end-ejection, p = 0.0001 versus normal).
 The maximal ejection force corresponded to a calculated intraventricular peak pressure gradient of 9.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg in normal subjects and 6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg in those with cardiomyopathy (p = 0.0001).
 The average contribution of the intrinsic component of the left ventricular systolic load (that is, wall stress associated with the ventricular to aortic pressure gradient) to the total myocardial load was 9.1% (range 7.3% to 11.2%) in normal subjects and 6.2% (range 3.9% to 7.5%) in those with cardiomyopathy (p = 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

 Doppler pressure half-time (PHT) is frequently used to assess mitral valve area (MVA), but the reliability of PHT has recently been challenged, specifically in the setting of balloon mitral valvotomy when hemodynamics have been abruptly altered.
 The effect of volume loading both before and after balloon mitral valvotomy on computation of MVA by Gorlin and by PHT in 18 patients with high-fidelity micromanometer measurements of left atrial and left ventricular pressure was therefore examined.
 Echocardiographic MVA increased from 0.91 +/- 0.15 to 1.97 +/- 0.42 cm2 after valvotomy.
 Volume loading produced significant increases in left atrial pressure (16 to 23 before and 12 to 20 mm Hg after valvotomy), in cardiac output (3.7 to 4.1 before and 3.9 to 4.6 liters/min after valvotomy), and in mitral valve gradient (11 to 14 before and 5 to 7 mm Hg after valvotomy).
 These hemodynamic changes were associated with modest but significant decreases in PHT and increases in MVA estimated by 220/PHT (0.66 to 0.81 before and 1.64 to 1.96 cm2 after valvotomy), whereas the MVA by Gorlin was not affected in a consistent fashion by volume loading (0.85 to 0.89 before and 1.66 to 1.69 cm2 after valvotomy).
 The correlation between Gorlin MVA and 220/PHT was only fair (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001) and was significantly poorer among patients with greater than 1+ mitral regurgitation (r = 0.72) than among those with less or no regurgitation (r = 0.79) (p = 0.001 by analysis of covariance for mitral regurgitation effect).

297,"Liver tumor imaging.
 Liver tumor imaging is the paradigm of the dilemma of diagnostic decision-making in the current era of abundant high technology.
 In part, this is a reflection of the multiplicity of imaging techniques now in wide use worldwide.
 These include ultrasound (US), radionuclide scintigraphy (RNS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and techniques especially designed for staging the extent of known liver cancer, such as computed tomography during arterial portography (CTAP) and intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS).
 Most authorities concede that CT scanning is the single test most closely fitting the designation ""gold standard"" for liver tumor imaging, although MRI, a less mature technique, is already preferred by some.
 Local factors profoundly influence the selection and sequence of imaging studies, including available equipment, radiologic skills, institutional interests, and especially the specific clinical circumstances of the patient.
 Thus, diagnostic algorithms or decision trees for sequential imaging workup of liver tumor suspects tend to be somewhat institution specific.

298,"Transdermal clonidine versus chlordiazepoxide in alcohol withdrawal: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
 In a prospective, double-blind comparison, we assessed the efficacy of transdermal clonidine with that of chlordiazepoxide in the treatment of moderately severe acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
 While having significant withdrawal symptoms, 50 hospitalized men were randomly assigned to receive either transdermal clonidine or chlordiazepoxide over a 4-day study period.
 Outcome was evaluated daily, medically and psychiatrically, using both objective and subjective measurements for dependent variables.
 No patient in either study group had seizures or progression to delirium tremens.
 The group receiving transdermal clonidine had a more significant response globally for the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, as measured by the Alcohol Withdrawal Assessment Scale.
 Also, clonidine more effectively lowered elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate.
 The core target symptom, anxiety, decreased significantly more in the patients receiving transdermal clonidine when measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and its subscale for somatic anxiety.
 Cognitive function responded equally in both study populations.
 Clonidine-treated patients reported less diarrhea, dizziness, headache and fatigue, and the chlordiazepoxide-treated patients reported less nausea and vomiting.
 We conclude that transdermal clonidine is effective treatment for the acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

299,"Sodium sensitive and sodium retaining hypertension.
 The differences between sodium sensitive and sodium retaining hypertension were theoretically considered using a water tank model of body fluid volume-blood pressure regulation.
 If an outlet valve is attached to a tank with a base area corresponding to the reciprocal of total peripheral resistance (TPR) and water is poured into this tank at a rate corresponding to the amount of Na+ intake, then equilibrium should be achieved at a certain water level, volume and output from the outlet, which represent mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO) and urinary Na+ excretion.
 The height of the outlet from the tank bottom and the size cross-sectional area, of the outlet correspond to the x-intercept and slope of the renal function (pressure-natriuresis) curve, respectively.
 In both nonsodium sensitive hypertension, due to the shift of the curve toward a higher blood pressure level (elevated height of the outlet) without change in the slope (size of the outlet), and sodium sensitive hypertension, due to the depressed slope of the curve (reduced outlet size), not only MAP (water level) but also CO (water volume) are increased, resulting in sodium retaining hypertension, if TPR (reciprocal of base area) remained unchanged, while CO is relatively unchanged, resulting in nonsodium retaining hypertension, if TPR is elevated.
 Thus, the MAP and its sensitivity to sodium intake is determined by the renal function curve.
 Since body fluid volume is determined by both the renal function curve and TPR, however, changes in TPR during the development of hypertension is a major factor in determining whether or not the body fluid volume has to change only a small amount or a large amount.
 Therefore, the sodium sensitivity of blood pressure and sodium retention must be considered separately.

300,"Sympathetic neural contribution to salt-induced hypertension in Dahl rats.
 The Dahl strain provides a model for examining mechanisms involved in the genetic sensitivity or resistance to salt-induced hypertension.
 Dahl salt-sensitive rats develop hypertension when fed a high salt diet; Dahl salt-resistant rats remain normotensive.
 Based on early experiments, it was thought that hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive rats epitomized the overriding importance of renal and humoral mechanisms in salt-induced hypertension, but studies in the past 15 years have demonstrated that alterations in sympathetic neural mechanisms also participate critically in the genetic predisposition to salt-induced hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive rats.
 This article briefly reviews sympathetic neural mechanisms in Dahl rats, including evidence for a role of afferent baroreceptor as well as central neural and peripheral adrenergic mechanisms in salt-induced hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive rats.

 The Cas-Br-E murine leukemia virus (MuLV) induces a spongiform myeloencephalopathy resulting in a progressive hindlimb paralysis.
 We have used in situ hybridization with a Cas-Br-E MuLV-specific probe to study viral expression in the central nervous system.
 Infected cells were concentrated in regions where spongiform lesions and gliosis are detected (lumbosacral spinal cord, brainstem, deep cerebellar regions), suggesting a causative link between the level of virus expression and the degree of pathological changes in this disease.
 However, viral expression was not in itself sufficient to cause disease, since significant viral expression was observed in regions that did not exhibit pathological changes (cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, corpus callosum, peripheral nervous system).
 In both diseased and nondiseased regions, endothelial and glial cells were identified as the main target cells.
 Neurons in diseased regions did not show viral expression.
 The regional distribution of the spongiform changes appears to be laid down very early following infection, since expression could be detected at 10 days postinfection in regions that become diseased.
 These results indicate that nonneuronal cells have distinct properties in various regions of the central nervous system and suggest an indirect mechanism of neuronal loss consequent to viral expression in nonneuronal cells.

302,"When is a prognostic factor useful? A guide for the perplexed.
 Traditionally, a number of variables have been used to predict outcome in patients with early-stage breast cancer.
 These tests are simple to perform and relatively inexpensive.
 Recently, a number of new factors, eg, tumor proliferative index, nuclear DNA content, and amplification or overexpression of growth-promoting genes or oncogenes have been identified as potential predictors of outcome in patients with breast cancer.
 There is now increasing pressure to introduce such tests into routine clinical practice.
 How does a clinical practitioner identify which test, or group of tests, best predicts adverse outcome and whether any more clinically useful information is provided than with the use of more traditional factors alone? The aim of a prognostic test in breast cancer is to predict which patients are destined to develop a recurrence of cancer and those who are not.
 The prognostic usefulness of a test can be expressed in terms of relative risk (RR), which is the ratio of the risk of breast cancer recurrence in patients who test positive to the risk in those who test negative.
 Methodologic guidelines that should be satisfied by a study evaluating the predictive ability of a test include the following: (1) Was an inception cohort assembled? (2) Was the referral pattern described? (3) Were laboratory and clinical outcomes assessed in a blinded fashion? (4) Was complete follow-up achieved? (5) Was adjustment for extraneous prognostic factors carried out? (6) Were appropriate statistical methods used? An approach is suggested to help the clinician choose the test, or combination of tests, likely to discriminate between ""high-"" and ""low-risk"" patients in his/her own practice.
 The decision regarding what particular threshold value (risk) defined by a prognostic test (or series of tests) warrants adjuvant therapy for an individual patient is a complex one but should be based on a clear presentation of the risks and benefits to the patient.

303,"Establishment of an erythroid cell line (JK-1) that spontaneously differentiates to red cells.
 The authors established a new hemopoietic cell line (JK-1) from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia in erythroid crisis.
 This JK-1 line predominantly consists of immature cells, but a small number of mature erythroblasts and red cells can be consistently seen without any specific differentiation inducer.
 The JK-1 cells grow in suspension culture supplemented with human plasma and carry double Philadelphia chromosomes.
 Hemoglobin staining with benzidine was positive for about 20% of cells and the type of the hemoglobin was for the most part HbF.
 Surface-marker analysis revealed JK-1 cells positive for glycophorin A, EP-1, and HAE9.
 The proportion of mature cells was elevated by the addition of delta-aminolevulinic acid.
 Erythropoietin (EPO) enhanced the growth of JK-1 cells either in the suspension or in methylcellulose semisolid culture.
 The total number of EPO receptors was 940 per cell, of which 220 sites had an affinity higher than the other 720 sites.

 In 450 cases of structural heart disease diagnosed prenatally, 38 fetuses (8.5%) had either a dysplastic or a displaced tricuspid valve.
 The tricuspid valve was dysplastic in 22 fetuses, all of which had evidence of tricuspid regurgitation resulting in right atrial dilation and increased cardiothoracic ratio.
 An associated abnormality of the pulmonary valve occurred in 16 fetuses.
 The remaining 16 fetuses had Ebstein's malformation, 14 with evidence of tricuspid incompetence at presentation and 10 with an associated abnormality of the pulmonary valve.
 Of the 38 cases, the pregnancy was interrupted in 17, spontaneous intrauterine fetal death occurred in 8, 11 infants died postnatally and 2 infants are still alive; additional abnormalities were found in 8 cases (chromosomal anomalies in 2, ventricular septal defects in 2, corrected transposition in 2, the Chiari malformation in 2, supraventricular tachycardia in 1 case and coarctation of the aorta in 1).
 Fetuses with severe abnormalities are selected for fetal echocardiography by the four chamber screening program and a high rate of natural loss both in intrauterine life and immediately after birth was observed in the 21 cases in which pregnancy was continued.
 This would explain the higher incidence of tricuspid valve disease in our prenatal compared with postnatal series.
 Although increased cardiothoracic ratio and associated lesions of the right ventricular outflow tract contribute to the poor outcome in the cases detected prenatally, the absence of these features does not always indicate a good prognosis because progression of disease can occur with advancing gestational age.
 No absolute measurement or single echocardiographic feature emerged as a consistent predictive factor of prognosis.

 Young, genetically hypertensive Lyon (LH) rats exhibited an increased renal in vivo turnover of norepinephrine and an elevated urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 when compared with normotensive (LN) and low blood pressure (LL) controls.
 Therefore, the effects of norepinephrine (1.2 x 10(-8) to 9.6 x 10(-7) M) and of phenylephrine (5 x 10(-8) to 1.9 x 10(-6) M) on renal function and the urinary excretion of prostanoids were assessed in isolated perfused kidneys of 8-week-old LH, LN, and LL rats.
 In addition, the effects of norepinephrine were assessed before and during thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor blockade by AH23848 (4 x 10(-6) M).
 Before drug infusion, LH kidneys differed from those of LN and LL controls by having an elevated renal vascular resistance and a decreased natriuresis and glomerular filtration rate; the urinary output of prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha, of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, and of thromboxane B2 was similar in the three strains.
 The constrictor effects of norepinephrine and phenylephrine were significantly increased in LH rat kidneys compared with LL but not with LN controls, and their pressure-natriuresis was markedly reduced.
 Norepinephrine and phenylephrine induced a 10- to 20-fold dose-dependent increase in the synthesis of the four prostanoids, which was more pronounced in LH than in LN and LL rats for thromboxane B2 only.
 AH23848 infusion significantly reduced the vascular effects of norepinephrine and increased the natriuretic response of LH but not of LN and LL rat kidneys.

 Variables derived from left ventricular volume were used to study post-extrasystolic potentiation.
 Left ventriculograms were obtained from 11 healthy individuals and 49 patients with coronary heart disease (30 with a previous myocardial infarction and 19 without any signs of myocardial damage).
 Post-extrasystolic potentiation was induced by a regularly driven right atrial rhythm that was interrupted by one atrial extrasystole in such a way that the post-extrasystolic RR interval was kept equal to the basic RR interval.
 The left ventricular end diastolic volumes of the pre-extrasystolic and post-extrasystolic beats were equal.
 In all groups there was evidence of post-extrasystolic potentiation in one or more of the indices of left ventricular function (ejection fraction, mean normalised systolic ejection rate, and systolic volume, and stroke volume).
 Potentiation was especially evident in patients with left ventricular damage; this suggests that a compensating mechanism is an intrinsic property of the myocardium.
 The Frank-Starling mechanism does not contribute to the increased performance of the post-extrasystolic beat in normal individuals or in patients with coronary artery disease.

 To determine the effect of elastic compression stockings on deep venous hemodynamics we measured ambulatory venous pressure, venous refill time, maximum venous pressure with exercise, amplitude of venous pressure excursion, and duplex-derived common femoral and popliteal vein diameter and peak flow velocities with and without stockings in 10 healthy subjects and 16 patients with chronic deep venous insufficiency.
 The effects of below-knee and above-knee 30 to 40 torr and 40 to 50 torr gradient stockings were studied.
 Despite documentation of substantial stocking compressive effects by skin pressure measurements, neither below-knee or above-knee elastic compression stockings significantly improved ambulatory venous pressure, venous refill time, maximum venous pressure with exercise, or the amplitude of venous pressure excursion in healthy patients or in patients with deep venous insufficiency (p greater than 0.05).
 In patients with deep venous insufficiency stockings modestly increased popliteal vein diameter and flow velocity in the upright resting position (p less than 0.02).
 After tiptoe exercise without stockings deep venous peak flow velocity increased in healthy patients and in patients with deep venous insufficiency by a mean of 103% in the popliteal vein and 46% in the common femoral vein (p less than 0.01).
 With the application of elastic compression stockings only modest augmentation of deep venous flow velocity occurred in both groups above that seen in the bare leg after exercise.
 Thus elastic compression stockings did not improve deep venous hemodynamic measurements in patients with deep venous insufficiency.
 The beneficial effects of stockings in the treatment of deep venous insufficiency must relate to effects other than changes in deep venous hemodynamics.

 The methodology addresses four important components of the analytic process: (1) the criteria that must be satisfied for a clinical practice to be considered effective; (2) proper methods for reviewing evidence from published clinical research to determine whether a clinical practice meets these criteria (including methods for performing comprehensive literature reviews, for judging the quality of individual studies, and for synthesizing or pooling the results of multiple studies); (3) theoretical and practical concerns in translating the results of the scientific review into sound clinical practice recommendations; and (4) the importance of documentation, guidelines, and other safeguards to minimize the effect the reviewers themselves have on the objectivity and consistency of the analytic methods.

 The use of craniofacial surgical techniques, extended open reduction, rigid fixation with plates and screws, and the replacement of severely damaged or missing bone with immediate bone grafting in the treatment of complex facial fractures has been applied to the management of severe gunshot wounds of the face.
 Early definitive bone and soft-tissue reconstruction has been performed in 37 patients.
 One-hundred and seventy-seven primary bone grafts were utilized in 33 patients for orbital, nasal, zygomatic, and maxillary reconstruction.
 Twenty-six patients required mandibular repair with compression or reconstruction plates.
 Soft-tissue reconstruction was provided by a combination of flaps.
 Four patients had extensive soft-tissue loss replaced by free vascularized omental flaps.
 The omentum provided circumferential coverage of the mandibular reconstruction and reconstruction of the floor of the mouth and was then tunneled in a circle through both cheeks into the middle and upper face.
 The omentum reconstructed deficits in the hard palate and upper buccal sulcus and was then wrapped around all zygomatic, orbital, and midfacial bone grafts and used to fill in dead space in the maxillary, ethmoid, and frontal sinuses.
 The omentum is not used to provide contour and bulk, but to cover bone grafts and plates and fill in dead space.
 Carefully shaped bone grafts provide the correct craniofacial scaffold.

 Three hundred ninety-seven patients with 407 cutaneous malignancies of the auricle, periauricular region, and cartilaginous external ear canal were reviewed.
 Tumors were most commonly located in the preauricular and postauricular regions, followed by the helix, concha, antihelix, and ear canal.
 All lesions were excised with Mohs microscopic control of margins.
 For lesions requiring lateral temporal bone resection, an adaptation of fresh-tissue microscopic control was used to analyze deep and anterior margins suspected of harboring residual tumor.
 Two-year minimum follow-up of 229 patients with periauricular and auricular tumors (N = 231 tumors) and 14 patients with cartilaginous ear canal tumors (N = 14 tumors) revealed recurrence rates of 6.9% and 14.3%, respectively.
 Recurrences were most common in cases of large tumors (greater than 2.5 cm), basal cell carcinomas with morphea elements, and multiply recurrent lesions.

 These bundles were compared with 18 matched control bundles from the contralateral hemidiaphragm.
 No statistically significant differences in twitch tension, tetanic tension, twitch-to-tetanus ratio, time to peak tension, or half-relaxation time were observed.
 Concentrations of 300 mg/l theophylline, however, significantly (P less than 0.05) increased force production at 10 Hz by 32%.
 A similar tendency was present at lower concentrations and exhibited a clear dose-response behavior.
 High-frequency fatigue was similar in control and theophylline-treated bundles.
 We conclude that supratherapeutic in vitro concentrations of theophylline do not increase maximal tetanic tension and do not protect against muscle fatigue but potentiate relative force production at low stimulation frequencies.
 This relatively small effect cannot be explained by poor diffusion of the drug in the muscle bundle, because theophylline concentrations in the muscle bath and in the muscle bundle were virtually identical.
 Moreover, it remains unclear whether this potentially beneficial effect can be achieved at in vivo attainable serum concentrations.

 An anaesthetic technique using high frequency jet ventilation has been proposed for direct laryngoscopy, but this may expose the patients to the risk of barotrauma.
 In order to assess this risk, we have measured end-expiratory airway pressure (EEP) through the injector using two three-way solenoid valves mounted in series.
 At the end of insufflation the first valve was switched off and the apparatus deadspace connected to atmosphere through a large exit port during an adjustable time (decompression time).
 Then the second valve was switched off and the injection line connected to a transducer, allowing measurement of EEP through the injector.
 The accuracy of this measurement was tested against airway pressure measured directly in the trachea (Pt) in a lung model.
 Provided that the decompression time was long enough (70 ms) and the apparatus deadspace was small (6 ml), the difference between EEP and Pt was less than 1 cm H2O for frequencies up to 5 Hz.
 A clinical evaluation was performed in 64 patients under general anaesthesia before laryngoscopy.
 EEP correlated with end-expiratory pulmonary volume above apnoeic FRC inferred from abdominal and thoracic displacements.
 At jet frequencies up to 5 Hz, the correlations between these two variables were satisfactory (r greater than 0.88), suggesting that EEP is a good indicator of pulmonary overdistension.

 Before ischemia, plasma flow rate, myocardial capillary extraction fraction, and PS values were similar in the two groups.
 Five minutes after the start of reperfusion, plasma flow rate increased significantly (p less than 0.01) in both groups.
 In the control group, capillary extraction fraction increased by 12% (p = NS) in spite of the higher plasma flow; these increases in capillary extraction fraction and plasma flow induced a 69% increase in PS (p less than 0.01).
 In the superoxide dismutase-treated group, capillary extraction fraction decreased by 32% (p less than 0.05) in accordance with the increased plasma flow rate, resulting in an unchanged PS (p = NS).
 Sixty minutes after reperfusion, plasma flow rate, capillary extraction fraction, and PS returned to preocclusion values in both groups (p = NS).
 The increased capillary extraction fraction and PS values seen in the control group suggest an increased capillary permeability after ischemia and reperfusion.
 Superoxide anions seem to participate, directly or indirectly, in this response.

 Unnecessary diagnostic procedures and recurrent hospitalizations often ensue.
 We saw a 39-year-old man with a novel variation of this disorder: factitious cyclic hypersomnia, or the simulation of recurrent episodes of excessive sleep.
 This case highlights the observations that patients whose illnesses are simulated may have diverse symptoms, that no syndrome is immune to factitious imitation, and that attempts at treatment, though exceedingly challenging, are always contingent upon appropriate recognition.

 The comparative validity of the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) and the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) in screening for current DSM-III alcohol abuse/dependence disorders is evaluated.
 These scales were administered to 501 patients presenting for treatment of alcohol or drug problems.
 DSM-III alcohol disorders are diagnosed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule.
 Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis is used to determine optimum threshold scores for the MAST and ADS and to compare the screening ability of the two instruments.
 Optimum cut points for the MAST and the ADS are 12/13 and 8/9, respectively.
 The overall accuracy of classification for both instruments using these threshold scores is 88%.
 The areas under the ROC curves are .91 and .90 (SD = .02) and there are no significant differences between the MAST and the ADS in their ability to screen for alcohol abuse or dependence in this population.
 The MAST and the ADS correlate highly with each other (.79).
 The results reported in our study should be applicable to the revised DSM-III since a field trial found a high level of agreement on alcohol disorders between the diagnostic systems.
 Categorical versus dimensional approaches to the assessment of alcoholism are discussed.

 We studied cerebrovascular anatomy using intra-arterial digital angiography, and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography in 42 patients with acute hemispheric ischemic brain infarction.
 We compared angiography with TCD and the clinical findings within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms.
 The location and extent of the chronic ischemic brain damage was assessed by CT performed 1 to 3 months after the ictus.
 Abnormal TCD, as manifested by either an unobtainable MCA flow signal or a significantly depressed MCA flow velocity, was highly associated with proximal MCA occlusions demonstrated by angiography.
 Abnormal TCD predicted both larger chronic CT lesions and more extensive ischemic change within the MCA territory.
 These data demonstrate that early TCD conveys useful information concerning cerebral tissue prognosis following hemispheric ischemia.

 A new simple modification to the silver staining of nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) was devised which, by performing the incubation with the slide inverted, results in minimal undesirable background staining, a persistent problem.
 Inverted incubation is facilitated by the use of a commercially available plastic coverplate.
 This technique has several additional advantages over other published staining protocols.
 In particular, the method is straightforward, fast, and maintains a high degree of contrast between the background and the AgNORs.

 To understand the in situ mechanism of immunological response of recipient animals to allografted tumor cells, the types of cells that infiltrated into the rejection site were examined.
 When Meth A cells (H-2d) were given i.p.
 to an allogeneic [C57BL/6 (H-2b)] strain of mouse, the tumor cells ceased to grow on the 6th day, accompanied by an i.p.
 infiltration of leukocytes.
 The tumor cells were totally eliminated from the peritoneal cavity around the 12th day.
 The highest cytotoxic activity against Meth A cells was obtained with the peritoneal exudate cells harvested on day 8.
 On this day, the exudate cells consisted of three populations when examined by flow cytometry, and each was isolated by sorting.
 Each of them appeared to be homogeneous, and they were morphologically identified as lymphocytes; granulocytes; and medium-sized, mononuclear, less-granular cells.
 The cytotoxic activity was confined exclusively to the last population.
 The effector cells (H-2b) were cytotoxic against not only Meth A cells (H-2d) but also concanavalin A-stimulated allogeneic spleen cells [C3H/He (H-2k), CBA/N (H-2k), A/J (H-2a), BALB/c (H-2d), and DBA/2 (H-2d) strains of mouse].
 The effector cells were totally inert against concanavalin A-activated syngeneic spleen cells [C57BL/6 (H-2b) and C57BL/10 (H-2b) strains of mouse].
 The effector cells were phenotypically (Thy-1.2- CD3- Lyt-1- Lyt-2- L3T4- immunoglobulin- asialo GM1-), morphologically, and functionally distinct from cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and lymphokine-activated killer cells but were adherent mononuclear phagocytes.

 A retrospective study of 305 pediatric trauma patients seen over 17 months was undertaken to evaluate the functional outcome of patients categorized as ""non-salvageable survivors"" (NSS).
 Functional outcome was determined by Denver Developmental Screen Tests (DDST) for children less than 5 years of age and Rappaport Severity Rating Scale (RDRS) for those 5 years old and older.
 Each patient was assigned Abbreviated Injury Scores (AIS).
 Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and Trauma Score (TS).
 The total number of patients classified as severe was 65 (21%), and 13 were classified as non-salvageable, with seven non-salvageable survivors and six non-preventable deaths.
 Our study suggests that current trauma scoring systems tend to overestimate the non-salvageable population.
 Those identified as non-salvageable and who survived have a high probability of meaningful functional recovery.
 Current trauma scoring systems are in need of revision to better identify non-salvageable survivors and those children who will not make a meaningful neurologic recovery.

 We studied prospectively the weight change and the effect of weight change on changes in coronary heart disease risk factors in a population-based sample of 485 middle-aged women.
 All women were studied first in 1983 to 1984, when they were premenopausal and aged 42 to 50 years, and then restudied in 1987.
 Women gained an average of 2.25 +/- 4.19 kg during this 3-year period; 20% of women gained 4.5 kg or more, and only 3% lost 4.5 kg or more.
 There were no significant differences in weight gain of women who remained premenopausal and those who had a natural menopause (+2.07 kg vs +1.35 kg).
 Weight gain was significantly associated with increases in blood pressure and levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting insulin.
 Weight gain is thus a common occurrence for women at the time of menopause and is related to the changes in coronary heart disease risk factors observed during this period.
 Efforts to lose weight or to prevent weight gain may help to mitigate the worsening in coronary heart disease risk factors in middle-aged women.

335,"Influence of chromosomal integration on glucocorticoid-regulated transcription of growth-stimulating papillomavirus genes E6 and E7 in cervical carcinoma cells.
 In most cervical carcinoma cells the E6 and E7 genes of specific human papillomaviruses are transcribed from viral sequences integrated into host cell chromosomes.
 Glucocorticoids activate the promoter elements of various human papillomaviruses in transient-expression assays.
 We have analyzed the effect of dexamethasone on the transcription rate of human papillomavirus 18 E6 and E7 genes integrated at different chromosomal sites in four cervical cancer cell lines.
 Dexamethasone led to an increase in the transcription rate of the integrated E6-E7 sequences in C4-1 and C4-2 cells but led to a decrease in SW 756 cells and did not affect the transcription rate in HeLa cells.
 However, when the viral promoter elements derived from HeLa or SW 756 cells, in which dexamethasone does not activate transcription of the integrated E6-E7 sequences, were tested in transient-expression assays within the same cell lines, dexamethasone consistently activated the viral promoter.
 It thus appears that dominant regulatory mechanisms presumably depending on the chromosomal integration site are able to override the response of the viral promoter to steroid hormones.
 The growth rate of all dexamethasone-treated cell lines correlated consistently with the expression of the papillomavirus E6 and E7 genes, supporting their role in the maintenance of the proliferative phenotype of cervical carcinoma cells.
 Since human papillomaviruses are integrated into the host cell genome at variable, presumably randomly selected chromosomal loci, regulatory mechanisms that influence viral gene expression, and hence cell growth, may differ among cancers of independent clonal origin.

 Our survey was designed to identify alcohol and cocaine use, and related psychosocial patterns.
 Men drank more and more often than women.
 Our data suggest that body weight should be considered in defining those who drink heavily and often.
 We define 'frequent heavy drinking' as five or more drinks in a row each week for men and three to four drinks or more in a row each week for women.
 Frequent heavy drinkers, cocaine users, and students with psychosocial problems appeared disproportionately among students planning to join fraternities and sororities.
 Although first-year students used cocaine infrequently, its users followed the patterns of frequent heavy drinkers.
 We believe efforts to correct alcohol and cocaine misuse by college students should be directed, in part, at social organizations such as Greek-letter societies.
 Also, we must attend to psychosocial features that predispose to alcohol and cocaine misuse.

 Regional myocardial ischemia and infarction were provided by means of ligature of the left coronary artery for 120 and 240 minutes respectively.
 Cardiac lymph was collected by conventional procedures.
 Enzymes released from the myocardium increased significantly in the cardiac lymph.
 The volume of cardiac lymph gradually increased after ligature of the coronary artery.
 Administration of hyaluronidase further increased the cardiac lymph flow and significantly decreased the I/R ratio as determined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and methylene blue staining.
 Drainage of the cardiac lymph salvaged the ischemic myocardium.

 The percentage of patients who did not request an analgesic, 30 mg IM pentazocine, for relief of pain during the first 24 postoperative hours was significantly greater in groups 2 and 3 than in group 1.
 In patients who did need 30 mg IM pentazocine postoperatively, the number of times pentazocine was administered was also significantly greater in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3.
 The percentage of patients developing respiratory depression or vomiting in the first 48 postoperative hours was similar in the three groups.
 Based on the present data and those we previously reported for intrathecal morphine, we conclude that an epidural morphine dose of 2-4 mg and an intrathecal morphine dose of 0.06-0.12 mg are equipotent for relief of postcholecystectomy pain.

 The trisomy 16 (Ts16) mouse, which shares genetic and phenotypic homologies with Down syndrome, exhibits impaired development of the basal forebrain cholinergic system.
 Basal forebrains obtained from Ts16 and euploid littermate fetuses at 15 days of gestation were dissociated and cultured in completely defined medium, with cholinergic neurons identified by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity.
 The Ts16 cultures exhibited fewer ChAT-immunoreactive neurons, which were smaller and emitted shorter, smoother, and more simplified neurites than those from euploid littermates.
 Whereas the addition of beta-nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) augmented the specific activity of ChAT and neuritic extension for both Ts16 and euploid cholinergic neurons, only Ts16 cultures exhibited an increase in the number and size of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons.

 Clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural characteristics of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by sensitization with a synthetic peptide corresponding to mouse myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) residues 139-151 HCLGKWLGHPDKF were studied in SJL/J mice.
 Groups of mice were immunized with 20, 50, or 100 nmol of the peptide and were killed from seven to 28 days after sensitization or when they were moribund.
 Beginning on Day 9, the mice showed signs of EAE and the disease progressed rapidly to paralysis.
 Central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, edema, gliosis, and demyelination were found in all mice killed between Days 10 and 28 and white matter lesion areas correlated with clinical score at the time the mice were killed.
 Peripheral nerve roots and the cauda equina did not have lesions.
 Within the range studied, the severity of clinical or histologic disease was the same regardless of the PLP peptide dose.
 Two of ten mice immunized with 100 nmol and none of 14 mice given smaller doses of a synthetic peptide of mouse myelin basic protein (MBP) showed clinical EAE.
 These mice had small numbers of CNS lesions that were indistinguishable from those in PLP peptide-sensitized mice.
 These findings demonstrate that immunization of SJL/J mice with PLP peptide 139-151 produces a disease with the clinical and morphologic features of CNS tissue-, whole PLP-, whole MBP-, and MBP peptide-induced acute EAE.
 Thus, PLP is a major encephalitogen and immune reactions to epitopes of different myelin proteins may induce identical patterns of injury in the CNS.

 The efficacy of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for the treatment of intracerebrally implanted rat gliosarcomas was tested.

 This infusion schedule resulted in average blood 10B concentrations of 35 micrograms/ml in a group of 12 gliosarcoma-bearing rats and 45 micrograms/ml in a group of 10 similar gliosarcoma-bearing rats treated by BNCT.
 Estimated tumor 10B levels in these two groups were 26 and 34 micrograms/g, respectively.
 On day 14, boron-treated and non-boron-treated rats were exposed to 5.0 or 7.5 MW.min of radiation from the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor that yielded thermal neutron fluences of approximately 2.0 x 10(12) or approximately 3.0 x 10(12) n/cm2, respectively, in the tumors.
 Untreated rats had a median postinitiation survival time of 21 days.
 Reactor radiation alone increased median postinitiation survival time to 26 (5.0 MW.min) or 28 (7.5 MW.min) days.
 The 12 rats that received 5 MW.min of BNCT had a median postinitiation survival time of 60 days.
 Two of these animals survived greater than 15 months.

 In man, acute stress, like extensive surgery, leads to a rapid and prolonged decrease in serum T3 concentrations.
 The present study was carried out to investigate the mechanisms that underly the abrupt decrease in T3-neogenesis that occurs in response to acute surgical stress.
 Male Sprague-Dawley rats, surgically thyroidectomized, and treated with 1.2 micrograms T4/100 g BW/day, underwent wide vertical and horizontal incisions extending into the abdominal cavity while receiving light ether anesthesia.
 Different dietary manipulations were performed to investigate the superimposed influence of reduced carbohydrate and caloric intake on T3-neogenesis.
 The metabolism of 125I T4 labeled in its outer (phenolic) ring was investigated in liver, kidney, and brain homogenates of animals killed 48 h after surgery.
 In liver, values for the proportion of T4 degraded and the percent generation of T3 and iodide were unaffected by laparotomy.
 The percent T3 generation in experiments with 25 nM T4 concentration was 3.7 +/- 1.24% (mean +/- SD) in fed control animals given free access to 5% glucose, 3.4 +/- 0.67% in unoperated controls given a restricted amount of chow and 5% glucose, and 3.8 +/- 0.67% in operated animals given free access to chow and 5% glucose.
 As expected, T3 neogenesis in livers from unoperated animals was significantly reduced in rats fasted for 48 h and this reduction was similar in laparotomized rats fasted for 48 h after surgery.
 As in the liver, no effect of laparotomy on T4 metabolism in kidney and brain homogenates was observed.
 Finally, serum total T4 and T3 concentrations were not affected by surgery.
 It is concluded that acute surgical stress in thyroidectomized T4 replaced rats does not influence T4 metabolism in liver, kidney, and brain homogenates or affect the serum T4 and T3 concentrations.
 Since thyroid secretion of T4 (and T3) was eliminated and careful attention was paid to caloric intake in this rat model, previously reported abnormalities in serum thyroid hormone concentrations and T3-neogenesis in various states of nonthyroidal illness in man and rat, including surgery, are probably contributed to by thyroid secretion of T4 (and T3) and caloric deprivation, especially carbohydrate.

 Seven of these patients had bone and soft tissue metastases, 4 had only soft metastases, and 4 had only bone metastases.
 The follow-up period ranged from 6-54 months; the number of doses ranged from 2-11, with 2.9 (78.4 mCi) to 9.25 gigabequerel (GBq) (250 mCi)/administration and a cumulative activity from 11.1-85.90 GBq (300-2322 mCi).
 The absorbed cumulative dose in tumors ranged from 12-155 Gy.
 A beneficial effect of the treatment was observed in 9 patients (60%).
 No complete remission of the disease was observed.
 Seven patients died during the study, among whom 4 never responded to the treatment.
 Seven had hormonal responses (4 complete and 3 partial), with a duration ranging from 5-48 months.
 Among these patients, 4 relapsed, and 3 died within 3 months.
 Five patients had partial tumoral responses mainly located in soft tissues and for a duration ranging from 29-54 months.
 All patients with a hormonal response had objective improvement in clinical status and blood pressure.
 There was no clear-cut relationship between the cumulative dose and the responses.
 The main side-effect observed in 1 patient with widespread bone metastases after three doses (12.9 GBq) was a pancytopenia, which resolved after treatment was discontinued.

346,"Clinical importance of myeloid-antigen expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia of childhood.
 BACKGROUND.
 Leukemic cells in 15 to 25 percent of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) express myeloid antigens as well as lymphoid antigens (the latter reflecting B-cell or T-cell lineage).
 The relations of myeloid-antigen expression to other features of ALL and to prognosis have been controversial.
 METHODS.
 We analyzed clinical and laboratory features present at diagnosis in 236 consecutive cases of ALL in children.
 Immunophenotyping, including single- and dual-fluorescence analyses, was used to classify leukemic cells as B or T lymphoblasts and also to identify myeloid-antigen expression--the simultaneous expression of lymphoid-associated antigens and at least one of three myeloid-associated antigens (CD33, CD13, and CD14) on cells classified as L1 or L2 according to the French-American-British system.
 RESULTS.
 Forty-five of 185 patients with B-lineage ALL had myeloid-antigen expression, as did 8 of 41 patients with T-lineage ALL.
 In 10 patients, the lineage could not be determined.
 Myeloid-antigen expression was associated with L2 morphology (P less than 0.05), but it did not correlate with other prognostic features recognized previously.
 Multivariate analysis showed that myeloid-antigen expression was an important predictor of relapse in childhood ALL and the most significant prognostic factor statistically (P less than 0.0001).
 A white-cell count greater than or equal to 50 x 10(9) per liter at diagnosis was also an important and highly significant prognostic feature (P less than 0.001).
 After 40 months, the estimated disease-free survival for patients with ALL was 84 percent for those without myeloid-antigen expression and with a low white-cell count, 57 percent for those without myeloid-antigen expression and with a high white-cell count, 47 percent for those with myeloid-antigen expression and a low white-cell count, and 26 percent for those with myeloid-antigen expression and a high white-cell count (P less than 0.00001).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Myeloid-antigen expression is an important independent predictor of a poor response to chemotherapy in childhood ALL.

 A constellation of neuroendocrine secretory aberrations, including reduced LH pulse frequency and PRL concentrations, has been documented in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA).
 As pituitary function was preserved, these aberrations were attributed to an alteration in hypothalamic neuromodulation.
 To investigate the participation of the dopaminergic system in the genesis of the reduced LH pulse frequency and suppressed PRL levels in FHA, we studied six women with FHA and six cyclic women in the early follicular phase by obtaining blood samples at 15-min intervals for 48 h during sequential 24-h infusions of saline and a dopamine receptor blocker, metoclopramide (MCP).
 A hypothalamic vs.
 pituitary site of action was inferred from the pulsatility characteristics.
 MCP consistently elicited an increase in the LH pulse frequency in the women with FHA [7.3 +/- 1.2 (+/- SE) to 10.5 +/- 1.3 pulses/24 h; P less than 0.005].
 In contrast, the eumenorrheic women did not show a significant change in LH pulse frequency in response to MCP (15.2 +/- 1.0 to 14.3 +/- 0.9 pulses/24 h).
 While the PRL concentrations were significantly lower in the FHA group during the infusion of saline (P less than 0.001) and MCP (P less than 0.005), the relative increases in PRL during MCP were similar in both groups.
 The acceleration of LH pulse frequency by blockade of dopamine receptors implies that there is increased hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition of GnRH pulse frequency in women with FHA.

 In group B (n = 6; age, 11.5-15.9 yr) ivGHRH induced a GH rise clearly higher than that induced by inGHRH (604.2 +/- 154.3 vs.
 137.1 +/- 28.2 micrograms/L.h; P less than 0.03).
 Administration of inNS induced a GH rise similar to that occurring after inGHRH (AUC, 239.2 +/- 69.5 micrograms/L.h) and markedly increased the inGHRH-induced GH response (482.4 +/- 103.6 micrograms/L.h; P less than 0.05 and 0.03 vs.
 inNS and inGHRH, respectively), so that it overlapped with that induced by ivGHRH alone.
 In conclusion, cholinergic agonists such as neostigmine are able to increase both basal and GHRH-induced GH secretion in short children even when given intranasally.
 Combined intranasal administration of neostigmine and GHRH (10 micrograms/kg) is able to induce a GH rise similar to that induced by ivGHRH alone (1 microgram/kg), suggesting the potential usefulness of this combination cocktail and route of administration for the treatment of short stature.

350,"Inverse correlation between plasma vitamin E and mortality from ischemic heart disease in cross-cultural epidemiology.
 Essential antioxidants were determined in plasma of middle-aged men representing 16 European study populations, which differed sixfold in age-specific mortality from ischemic heart disease (IHD).
 In 12 populations with ""common"" plasma cholesterol (5.7-6.2 mmol/L) and blood pressure, both classical risk factors lacked significant correlations to IHD mortality, whereas absolute levels of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) showed a strong inverse correlation (r2 = 0.63, P = 0.002).
 Evaluating all populations, cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure were moderately associated, but their correlation was inferior to that of vitamin E.
 In stepwise regression and multiple regression analysis, mortality was predictable to 62% by lipid-standardized vitamin E, to 79% by vitamin E and cholesterol, to 83% after inclusion of lipid-standardized vitamin A (retinol), and to 87% by all the above parameters plus blood pressure.
 Thus, in the present study the cross-cultural differences of IDH mortality are primarily attributable to plasma status of vitamin E, which might have protective functions.

 Sacrifice of major growth plates during resection and fixed-length reconstruction of a limb in a skeletally immature child with osteosarcoma may result in a significant limb-length inequality as growth progresses.
 A limb-length discrepancy in the humerus may cause minor cosmetic problems but does not generally result in a significant functional deficit.
 In the lower extremity, tumors about the knee, including the distal femur and proximal tibia, usually present the dilemma of whether limb salvage by arthrodesis, osteoarticular allograft, or endoprosthetic replacement would result in a significant limb-length inequality and whether amputation of the extremity is a preferable procedure.
 The techniques of rotationplasty and an expandable endoprosthesis have been successfully used for treating skeletally immature patients with osteosarcoma of the distal femur.
 With regard to survival and function, the results obtained with these innovative methods are favorable compared with those of a high above-knee amputation.

352,"Surgical decompression without transposition for ulnar neuropathy: factors determining outcome.
 Fifty-one surgical decompressions without nerve transposition for ulnar neuropathy were performed in 46 patients.
 All of the patients were men with an average age of 59 years at the time of surgery.
 The follow-up range was between 5 and 32 months (average, 17.8 months).
 The disease involved the nondominant arm in 24 patients (52%) and was bilateral in 5 (11%).
 In 23 cases (50%), no predisposing condition could be identified, whereas 15 patients (33%) abused alcohol and 8 patients (17%) had diabetes mellitus.
 Fifty-seven percent of the patients helped by surgery had symptoms for less than 1 year, whereas only 30% of patients with symptoms for more than 1 year had symptomatic improvement.
 The relative magnitude of the slowing of ulnar nerve conduction velocity across the elbow was not significantly correlated with the success of decompression in relieving symptoms.
 Ulnar nerve conduction velocities across the elbow were 36.13 +/- 11.76 m/s in those responding to surgery and 38.97 +/- 13.91 m/s in those not responding (c = 0.06, dF = 50, P less than 0.3).
 A total of 37 patients showed symptomatic improvement after decompression.
 Simple decompression of the ulnar nerve was performed under local anesthesia without transposition of the nerve.
 In all of these cases, compression of the nerve occurred predominantly in the epicondylar groove.
 Narrowing of the nerve in the groove was present in 28 cases (55%); scar tissue was found adhering to the nerve in 21 cases (41%); and two pseudoneuromas were found (4%).
 Forty-one operations (80%) resulted in symptomatic improvement, typically noted by the patient within the first month postoperatively.

353,"Low-dose caffeine physical dependence in humans.
 This study investigated the effects of terminating low dose levels of caffeine (100 mg/day) in 7 normal humans.
 Substitution of placebo capsules for caffeine capsules occurred under double-blind conditions while subjects rated various dimensions of their mood and behavior.
 In the first phase of the study, substitution of placebo for 12 consecutive days resulted in an orderly withdrawal syndrome in 4 subjects which peaked on days 1 or 2 and progressively decreased toward prewithdrawal levels over about 1 week.
 Data from the remaining three subjects provided no evidence of withdrawal.
 In the second phase of the study, the generality of the withdrawal effect was examined by repeatedly substituting placebo for 100 mg/day of caffeine for 1-day periods separated by an average of 9 days.
 Despite differences within and across subjects with respect to the presence, nature and magnitude of symptoms, each of the seven subjects demonstrated a statistically significant withdrawal effect.
 Although the phenomenon of caffeine withdrawal has been described previously, the present report documents that the incidence of caffeine withdrawal is higher (100% of subjects), the daily dose level at which withdrawal occurs is lower (roughly equivalent to the amount of caffeine in a single cup of strong brewed coffee or 3 cans of caffeinated soft drink) and the range of symptoms experienced is broader (including headache, fatigue and other dysphoric mood changes, muscle pain/stiffness, flu-like feelings, nausea/vomiting and craving for caffeine) than heretofore recognized.

 Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules export peptides to the cell surface for surveillance by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
 Intracellular peptide binding is critical for the proper assembly and transport of class I molecules.
 This mechanism is impaired as a result of a non-functional peptide supply factor gene (PSF) in several human mutant cell lines with genomic lesions in the MHC.
 We have now identified PSF in the MHC class II region by deletion mapping in mutants and chromosome-walking.
 PSF is homologous to mammalian and bacterial ATP-dependent transport proteins, suggesting that it operates in the intracellular transport of peptides.

357,"Role of oxygen free radicals in ischemic and reperfused myocardium.
 In recent years there has been considerable interest concerning the role of oxygen radicals in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury.
 The sequential univalent reduction of oxygen gives rise to very reactive intermediate products.
 Normally, the tissue concentration of these intermediate products of oxygen is limited and the aerobic myocardium survives because of the existence of a delicate balance between the generation of the various oxidants and the maintenance of the antioxidant defense mechanism.
 Several possible sources have been identified for the production of active oxygen species after ischemia and reperfusion and these sources may be mutually interactive.
 The ability of scavengers of oxygen free radicals, including vitamin E, to improve mechanical, mitochondrial, and sarcoplasmic reticulum function in animal models of ischemic-reperfusion injury also suggests that oxygen free radicals are partly responsible for myocardial damage in these models, although caution in the interpretation of these data is necessary.

358,"Efficacy of coronary sinus cardioplegia in patients with complete coronary artery occlusions.
 Myocardial areas distal to complete coronary artery occlusions are poorly protected by antegrade cardioplegia.
 We assessed the effects of coronary sinus cardioplegia in 30 patients undergoing bypass operations and at high risk of cardioplegic maldistribution because of the following anatomical patterns of coronary artery disease: critical (greater than or equal to 50%) stenosis of the left main trunk with total occlusion of the right coronary artery (16 patients) or critical (greater than or equal to 70%) stenosis of the right coronary artery with total occlusion of the left anterior descending (11 patients) or circumflex artery (3 patients).
 After induction of arrest through the aorta, coronary sinus cardioplegia was given intermittently during the cross-clamp period at a flow rate of 100 mL/min.
 Intraoperatively, occluded arteries were consistently found to be filled with the retrogradely infused solution.
 One patient died early postoperatively of low cardiac output and a second patient died later during his hospital stay, presumably of an arrhythmia.
 At autopsy, none of them had pathological evidence of inadequate myocardial protection.
 One patient sustained a myocardial infarction and 3 others required inotropes for more than 24 hours postoperatively.
 Postoperative values for right and left stroke volume indices were not significantly different from prebypass levels.
 Overall, these results are consistent with the occurrence of limited intraoperative ischemic damage and, by inference, suggest the efficacy of the coronary sinus route in preserving myocardial areas supplied by completely occluded coronary arteries and, hence, in jeopardy of inadequate cardioplegia delivery.

359,"Oxygen uptake and heart rate responses during hypoxic exercise in children and adults.
 Control of ventilation and heart rate during exercise appears to undergo maturation, while aerobic metabolism (VO2) may not.
 Since we had previously found that hypoxia during exercise produced different ventilatory responses in children (C) compared to adults (A), we hypothesized that VO2 and heart rate kinetics during exercise would show similar maturational responses to hypoxia.
 To test this hypothesis, we examined the responses during progressive (ramp) and constant work rate tests in children and adults breathing either room air or hypoxic gas (FiO2 = 0.15).
 When corrected for body weight, children and adults had similar values for lactic acidosis threshold (LAT) (C: 29.1 +/- 5.0 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 27.9 +/- 4.3) and VO2max (C: 40.7 +/- 8.6 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 45.2 +/- 6.7) during normoxia.
 Hypoxia significantly lowered LAT (C: 27.5 +/- 5.4 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 23.2 +/- 3.8; both P less than 0.05) and VO2max (C: 37.7 +/- 8.3 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 40.1 +/- 5.3; both P less than 0.05) in both children and adults.
 Metabolic efficiency (delta VO2/delta work rate) and the VO2-heart rate relationship (delta VO2/delta HR/kg) were similar in the two groups and unaffected by hypoxia.
 During the constant work rate exercise, VO2 kinetics (time constant during phase 2 of the response (pi 1) and the O2 deficit) were similar between children and adults and were significantly slowed by hypoxia, consistent with current understanding of the control of oxidative metabolism.
 Finally, heart rate was increased at rest and during exercise with hypoxia, while the time to reach 75% of the end-exercise response was delayed significantly, in both groups.

360,"Influence of low osmolality contrast media on electrophysiology and hemodynamics in coronary angiography: differences between an ionic (ioxaglate) and a nonionic (iohexol) agent.
 It has recently been suggested that the addition of sodium to low osmolality contrast media may reduce the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and conduction disturbances during coronary angiography.
 In a randomized, double blind study of 30 patients undergoing coronary angiography we therefore examined the electrophysiological and hemodynamic effects of the two low osmolality contrast media-ioxaglate (with sodium) and iohexol (without sodium).
 Standard ECG, aortic blood pressure, and His bundle electrocardiogram were recorded.
 The contrast media were well tolerated and no serious arrhythmias were observed.
 Both induced a transient decrement in systolic blood pressure and reduction in heart rate 10 s following contrast injection (all P less than 0.01).
 Ioxaglate prolonged the QT interval at 10 s (P less than 0.01) and also when analysed for the whole observation period (120 s) (P less than 0.05), whereas iohexol did not cause any significant changes in the QT-interval.
 The AH-interval was prolonged by ioxaglate at 10 s (P less than 0.01), but not altered by iohexol.
 Thus, other factors than osmolality and sodium content might contribute to QT prolongation, since only the contrast agents with sodium (ioxaglate) induced QT prolongation in this study.

 Prediction of atrial fibrillation (AF) is very important in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or in the selection of pacemaker therapeutic modality.
 In 25 patients with transient AF, the response of the atrial activity width to extrastimuli was examined in comparison with 25 patients without AF to see if the results could be used as an index of subsequent occurrence of AF.
 Programmed electrical stimulation using eight basic stimuli followed by single or double extrastimuli (P1P2 or P1P2P3) were delivered to the high right atrium, and the atrial activities were examined.
 The prolongation of the atrial activity caused by extrastimuli was termed fragmentation (Frg), and it was defined as the prolongation of more than 150% of the basic stimuli.
 Frg zone was defined as the zone of coupling intervals of the extrastimuli (P1P2 or P2P3) that caused Frg, and delta max Frg was defined as the difference between the widest Frg and the atrial wave width during basic stimuli.
 Fragmentation was reproducibly induced by extrastimuli, and there was an inverse relationship between Frg duration and the coupling interval of the extrastimuli (P1P2 or P2P3).
 Frg zone and delta max Frg were wider and longer in patients with transient AF in comparison with the control group for both single and double extrastimuli (p less than 0.001).

 1, 1979, to Dec.
 31, 1989, under ICD code E917, E922, E955, E965, E970 or E985 who had suffered air gun injuries.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Personal data, circumstances of event and clinical data.
 RESULTS: The 43 children (37 boys) had a median age of 12 years.
 The circumstances of the accident were known in 20 cases: 17 children were playing and 3 were cleaning the gun when it went off.
 Four children thought the gun was unloaded.
 In five cases the bullet ricocheted into the eye.
 Nine injuries were self-inflicted.
 Injury was to the extremities in 21 (49%), the eyes in 15 (35%) and the head and neck in 7 (16%).
 The median length of hospital stay was 4 days.
 Six children had long-term disabilities, all the result of eye injuries; two had cataract surgery, and four required enucleation of the eye.

 Measurements of the position of the internal os relative to the position of the anterior and posterior walls of the maxillary sinus and the position of the orbit were taken.
 The dimensions and configuration of the antronasal canal and its relationship to the infundibulum were also detailed.

 The number of imaging modalities available to stage and follow-up patients with primary neoplasms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract continues to increase.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography are useful techniques for both staging and follow-up.
 For staging, CT is most frequently used for the detection of liver metastases and is increasingly used as a substitute for the chest radiograph in the detection of lung metastases.
 CT is still the imaging test of choice for the preoperative staging of esophageal carcinoma.
 CT is less helpful in staging the patient with gastric carcinoma or colorectal carcinoma.
 The current usefulness of MRI in the staging of GI tract malignancies is limited by the lack of an adequate oral intraluminal contrast agent and degradation of images due to motion.
 Sonography, especially the new technique of endoscopic ultrasound, is promising for the detection of local invasion from GI tract malignancies.
 CT is used in the follow-up of patients with tumors of the GI tract to detect liver, adrenal, and nodal metastases as well as local recurrence because of the ability of CT to detect extraluminal masses.
 CT of the pelvis has been recommended as a routine follow-up procedure in patients who have undergone abdominal-peroneal resection.
 Both CT and MRI can be used to detect local recurrence, but suffer from the inability to differentiate scar from recurrent tumor.
 The initial hope that MRI would be capable of differentiating postoperative scar tissue from recurrent tumor has not been realized.
 Therefore, with positive CT or MRI findings, occasionally a percutaneous biopsy will be required to confirm local recurrence.

 The purpose of this study was to examine the interrelationships among stressful events, domain-specific assessments of life satisfaction, and global evaluations of life satisfaction.

 According to bottom-up theory, older adults first assess feelings of satisfaction within specific life domains that are based in part on the experiences (i.e., stressors) they encounter in these areas.
 The domain-specific views are subsequently synthesized to form an overall sense of satisfaction with life as a whole.
 In contrast, the top-down theory suggests that a person's ongoing sense of satisfaction with life as a whole predisposes him or her to assess satisfaction with specific domains in ways that are congruent with his or her initial sense of global life satisfaction.
 Analysis of data provided by older participants in a nationwide survey tends to support the bottom-up perspective.

 Adverse hemodynamic reactions after protamine neutralization of heparin are an infrequent but important clinical problem.
 Pre-treatment of swine with a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist has been reported to prevent the pulmonary hypertensive response occasionally seen after protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation.
 In the current study, a control group of pigs (n = 9) received intravenous heparin (300 IU/kg), followed after 10 min by a neutralizing dose of protamine (3 mg/kg).
 A treatment group of pigs (n = 11) was treated identically, except that the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist L-670596 (2 mg/kg) was infused intravenously 2 min after the protamine infusion.
 Hemodynamic and coagulation profiles were monitored during these procedures.
 Pulmonary hypertension developed and reached a peak within 2 min of protamine administration, often at the same time that L-670596 was administered in the treatment group.
 There was no statistical difference between control and treatment groups' peak pulmonary arterial pressure and peak pulmonary vascular resistance.
 However, the interval for return of mean pulmonary artery pressure from peak to baseline values was 11.6 +/- 3.1 versus 5.5 +/- 1.9 min (mean +/- SD) for control and treatment groups, respectively (P less than 0.01).
 Thromboxane B2 plasma concentrations increased in both groups and were correlated with the pulmonary hypertensive response (r = 0.86, P less than 0.01).
 Platelet aggregation to collagen was inhibited by the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist (P less than 0.05).
 Bleeding time was prolonged beyond normal range in 50% of L-670596-treated pigs.

 OBJECTIVES--To examine how district health authorities organised cervical screening with respect to Department of Health guidelines and to determine their assessment of the problems encountered.
 DESIGN--Postal questionnaire sent to all 190 district health authorities in England in 1989.
 PARTICIPANTS--190 District health authorities in England.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Population coverage of screening, quality of smear testing, and follow up of abdominal test results in comparison with national guidelines for district cervical screening services, and problems encountered by districts.
 RESULTS--Replies were received from 178 (94%) of districts, in 143 of which the person named as responsible for cervical screening contributed.
 All districts implemented a computer managed scheme, 150 by the target date of 31 March 1988, but not all of these conformed with the guidelines.
 At the time of the survey only just over half called women in the target age group of 20-64 and only 70% expected to meet the target date of 13 March 1993 for completing the call.
 Considerable variation was evident among the schemes with regard to how they dealt with issues related to population coverage, quality of testing, and follow up of abnormal results.
 The problems most commonly identified by the districts (n = 174) were laboratory workload (107, 61%), computer software (104, 60%), availability of resources (78, 45%), non-attendance (77, 44%), rate of opportunistic screening (62, 36%), and investigation and treatment (60, 34%).

 It correctly categorized all patients with ostium secundum and ostium primum ASD but misdiagnosed 3 of 5 patients with surgically proven sinus venosus ASD.

 The maximum width of the color flow signals moving across the ASD was taken as its diameter.
 Mean flow velocity was determined either by placing a pulsed Doppler sample volume parallel to the flow across the ASD as visualized by color Doppler or by color M-mode examination, which allowed determination of flow velocities using a previously validated method that incorporates a computer analysis of pixel color intensity.
 The pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio obtained by color-guided conventional Doppler interrogation of the left and right ventricular outflow tracts correlated poorly with cardiac catheterization results (r = 0.38).
 In patients with associated tricuspid regurgitation, the peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure obtained by color Doppler-guided continuous-wave Doppler correlated well with that obtained at cardiac catheterization (r = 0.89).

 Annual mammography, in combination with clinical breast examinations, can reduce mortality from breast cancer.
 However, surveys of both patients and physicians suggest that mammography is underutilized.

 Data from 576 primary care physicians (internal medicine, family/general practice, and obstetrics/gynecology) who participated in a mailed statewide survey were analyzed.
 Physicians reported screening elderly women significantly less often than younger women, regardless of family history of breast cancer.
 With the exception of medical specialty, physicians' demographic and practice characteristics were not associated with reported screening practices.
 However, physicians' knowledge and beliefs about breast cancer in older women were associated with reported screening practices.
 When analyzing barriers to ordering mammography, cost to the patient was viewed as a barrier for women of all ages, and pain was viewed as a greater barrier for younger women; otherwise, physicians consistently believed that their elderly patients faced considerably more barriers compared with younger women.
 Further investigation is required to examine why primary care physicians report age-related differences in both breast screening and barriers to mammography.

 The role of neutrophil chemoattractant receptors in neutrophil stimulation in vitro is well established, however, the precise mechanisms underlying local neutrophil accumulation at inflammatory sites in vivo have not been defined.
 A fundamental question that remains open is whether chemoattractants act on the endothelial cell or the neutrophil to initiate the process of neutrophil migration in vivo.
 To address this question we have investigated whether neutrophil accumulation in vivo can occur if chemoattractant receptor occupancy is uncoupled from neutrophil stimulation.
 For this purpose we have used pertussis toxin (PT) as the pharmacologic tool.
 We have investigated the effect of in vitro pretreatment of rabbit neutrophils with PT on their responses in vitro and on their accumulation in vivo.
 Pretreatment of rabbit neutrophils with PT inhibited FMLP- and C5a-, but not PMA- induced increases in CD18 expression, neutrophil adherence, and degranulation in vitro.
 This pretreatment procedure with PT inhibited the accumulation of radiolabeled neutrophils in vivo in response to intradermally injected FMLP, C5a, C5a des Arg, leukotriene B4, IL-8, and zymosan in rabbit skin.
 Further, in contrast to the in vitro results, PT inhibited the PMA-induced 111In-neutrophil accumulation in vivo.
 Interestingly, pretreatment of neutrophils with PT also inhibited accumulation in response to intradermally injected IL-1, despite the reports that IL-1 lacks neutrophil chemoattractant activity in vitro.
 Although the experimental techniques used cannot distinguish the different stages of neutrophil migration involved, these results suggest that the accumulation of neutrophils induced by local extravascular chemoattractants in vivo depends on a pertussis toxin-sensitive receptor operated event on the neutrophil itself.
 Further, PMA and IL-1 may release secondary chemoattractants in vivo.

376,"Conditioning prepulse of biphasic defibrillator waveforms enhances refractoriness to fibrillation wavefronts.
 The mechanism of biphasic waveform defibrillation threshold reduction is unknown.
 We tested the hypothesis that, during refractory period stimulation, sarcolemmal hyperpolarization by the first pulse of biphasic waveforms facilitates excitation channel recovery, which enhances graded responses produced by the second depolarizing pulse.
 This prolongs cellular refractoriness to fibrillation wavefronts when compared with a monophasic depolarizing stimulus.
 Monophasic (10 msec, rectangular wave) or symmetrical biphasic (10 msec, each pulse) current injection S2 stimuli at 1.5 and two times S1 threshold were used to scan the S1 action potential refractory period (S1 cycle length, 600 msec) in myocardial cell aggregates.
 S2 waveforms were delivered with normal and reversed polarity to test the hyperpolarizing action of biphasic waveforms.
 Responses to an S3 stimulus, which simulated a potential incoming fibrillation wavefront, were also determined.
 Results showed that biphasic S2 waveforms produced longer graded responses during and immediately after the S1 refractory period than did corresponding monophasic S2 waveforms.
 The maximum difference in response duration produced by the biphasic and monophasic waveforms was 58.6 +/- 10.0 msec (p less than 0.001).
 This maximum difference occurred 10 msec before the end of the S1 refractory period.
 The longer response durations produced by biphasic S2 also produced longer refractoriness to the S3 stimulus.
 The maximum difference in total refractoriness to S3 of 51.8 +/- 2.8 msec (p less than 0.002) occurred at the same S1S2 coupling interval as the maximum difference in S2 response duration.
 Prolonged refractoriness may protect ventricular cells from refibrillation wavefronts and act as the cellular basis for greater biphasic waveform defibrillation efficacy.

377,"Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: the Harborview experience.
 During the last decade (1980 to 1989) 186 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were admitted to a single urban hospital.
 Ninety-six percent of these patients had a prehospital systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg.
 Management included paramedic field resuscitation and transport, an emergency department diagnostic protocol completed in an average of 12 minutes, rapid transport to a dedicated emergency operating room, aneurysmorrhaphy by general surgery chief residents under the supervision of specialist vascular surgeons, and skilled postoperative intensive care unit care.
 Nevertheless, 130 (70%) patients died in the first 30 postoperative days--3% in the emergency department, 13% in the operating room, 51% in the intensive care unit, and 3% on the ward or at home.
 Certain features--age greater than 80 years, female gender, persistent preoperative hypotension despite aggressive crystalloid and blood replacement, admission hematocrit less than 25, transfusion requirements exceeding 15 units--were associated with a greater than 90% likelihood of death.
 No patient with preoperative cardiac arrest survived more than 24 hours.
 From this experience we conclude that, although ""optimal"" prehospital, emergency department, operating room, and postoperative care can improve the outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in shock, most such patients will die.
 Certain clinical features predict such excessive mortality rates after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms that withholding operation may be reasonable.
 Screening of patients at high risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm, followed by elective aneurysmorrhaphy, is clearly indicated.

 Kinking and compression with knee flexion are thought to be one cause of failure of below-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypass.
 To prevent this problem polytetrafluoroethylene grafts externally supported with rigid rings have been developed.
 The present randomized, prospective study compared ringed and nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in 122 patients who underwent femoropopliteal bypass for severe limb ischemia.
 Patients were well matched for surgical indications and risk factors.
 There was no significant difference in the 3-year graft patency rate of ringed versus nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (74% vs 68%, p = 0.5).
 Similarly, no significant differences were found in the 3-year graft patency rates of ringed versus non-ringed above-knee (82% vs 74%, p = 0.5) or below-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (68% vs 59%, p = 0.5).
 The 3-year graft patency rate of all above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses was slightly greater than that of below-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (76% vs 62%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25).
 The 3-year limb salvage rate with ringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts was 92% compared with 79% for nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25).
 Data to date from this study fail to support the recommendation that ringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts be used preferentially over conventional polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in patients who require femoropopliteal bypass with a synthetic graft.

 The results of previous studies have suggested that significant stenosis of the carotid artery occurs in less than 6 per cent of asymptomatic patients.
 However, some populations studied were not representative of those seen by most vascular surgeons.
 Accordingly, we examined two cohorts of patients at the Veterans Administration Medical Center using Duplex scanning.
 There were 153 volunteers in group 1, all more than 50 years of age, who were being treated at our outpatient department for nonvascular problems.
 There were 116 patients of similar age in group 2 but who were known to have significant arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremity.
 The majority of patients were men with a mean age of 64.4 years.
 Risk factors in the total population included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary arterial disease, peripheral vascular disease and smoking.
 Over-all, significant (greater than 50 per cent diameter) stenosis of the carotid artery was discovered in 25 of 269 patients.
 The prevalence for those in group 1 was 6.5 per cent versus 12.9 per cent for those in group 2 (p = 0.058).
 The prevalence in patients with cardiac disease was 15.2 per cent compared with 6.8 per cent in those without cardiac disease (p = 0.032).
 Smoking was associated with a 10.6 per cent rate of significant disease compared with a 2.3 per cent rate in nonsmokers (p = 0.065).
 Hypertension and diabetes were not significant risk factors.
 Significant stenosis of the carotid artery was found in seven of 40 patients in whom coronary arterial disease, peripheral vascular disease and smoking were all present.

380,"Renal manifestations of NaCl sensitivity in borderline hypertensive rats.
 Compared with the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat, the spontaneously hypertensive rat exhibits exaggerated alterations in renal sympathetic nerve activity and excretory function during volume expansion (exaggerated natriuresis) and environmental stress (antinatriuresis).
 The borderline hypertensive rat is the first filial offspring of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and the Wistar-Kyoto rat and develops hypertension with increased dietary NaCl intake.
 The present investigation sought to determine whether the dietary NaCl intake-induced transition from the normotensive state of the Wistar-Kyoto parent to the hypertensive state of the spontaneously hypertensive parent in the borderline hypertensive rat was accompanied by a similar transition of the renal sympathetic nerve activity and excretory responses to volume expansion and environmental stress.
 Borderline hypertensive rats fed a 1% NaCl diet remained normotensive and exhibited renal sympathetic nerve activity and excretory responses to volume expansion and environmental stress that were similar to those of their Wistar-Kyoto parent.
 Borderline hypertensive rats fed an 8% NaCl diet developed hypertension and exhibited responses that were similar to those of their spontaneously hypertensive parent.
 Thus, the dietary NaCl intake-induced transition from the normotensive state of the Wistar-Kyoto parent to the hypertensive state of the spontaneously hypertensive parent in the borderline hypertensive rat was accompanied by a similar transition of the renal sympathetic nerve activity and excretory responses to volume expansion and environmental stress.
 The results suggest that increased dietary NaCl intake is able to induce or unmask the capabilities for these responses, which are genetically conveyed to the borderline hypertensive rat by the spontaneously hypertensive rat parent in latent forms.

 Clinical charts, radiological features, macroscopic and microscopic findings, and clinical follow-up data were retrospectively reviewed in 11 patients with papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas (PCNP).
 The patients were nine women and two men, aged from 13 to 51 years with a mean age of 25 years.
 The greatest diameter of the PCNPs ranged from 2.5 cm to 14.0 cm with a mean size of 7.5 cm.
 Six tumours were located in the tail of the pancreas, two in the body and three in the head.
 Most patients complained of abdominal pain or a mass.
 Ultrasonographic and/or computed tomography findings showed five solid, four mixed (solid and cystic) and two cystic types of tumour.
 Angiographically, PCNP was either a hypovascular or mild hypervascular mass with a displacement of the surrounding vessels.
 No vascular encasement was seen.
 Macroscopically all 11 tumours consisted of a well defined solid mass with degenerative change of various widths, including haemorrhage, necrosis or dystrophic calcification, and were represented by three radiological types of PCNP.
 The 11 patients with PCNP survived for from 3 to 253 months after curative resection without any signs of local recurrence or remote metastasis.
 PCNP usually affects the distal portion of the pancreas of young women.
 Despite its huge size, PCNP should be explored with aggressive surgical intent because of the inherently good prognosis.

383,"Tonic contraversive ocular tilt reaction due to unilateral meso-diencephalic lesion.
 We studied 4 patients with tonic contraversive ocular tilt reactions due to unilateral, paramedian, mesodiencephalic lesions.
 This is in contrast to the only 2 previously reported patients with ocular tilt reactions due to unilateral mesodiencephalic lesions, each of whom had a paroxysmal ipsiversive ocular tilt reaction.
 This new finding is considered in the context of previous clinical and experimental data on the various types of ocular tilt reactions that follow stimulation or destruction of the peripheral and central vestibular system.
 Otolithic inputs to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal from the contralateral vestibular nucleus and motor outputs from the interstitial nucleus of Cajal to cervical and ocular motoneurons could be involved in the ocular tilt reaction.
 We propose that in patients with unilateral meso-diencephalic lesions, a tonic contraversive ocular tilt reaction could be due to persistently decreased resting activity of ipsilateral interstitial nucleus neurons, whereas a paroxysmal ipsiversive ocular tilt reaction could be due to transiently increased activity of the same interstitial nucleus neurons.
 Cases of ocular tilt reaction due to unilateral meso-diencephalic lesion point to the existence of a crossed graviceptive pathway between the vestibular nucleus and the contralateral interstitial nucleus of Cajal.

 Three hemophilia B patients with anti-factor IX antibodies who had no detectable gross deletion of the factor IX gene by Southern blotting analysis were investigated at the molecular level.
 All eight exons, accompanied by their splicing junction sites and presumptive promoter regions of the factor IX gene in these patients (total 5.5 kb in length) were amplified with the use of the polymerase chain reaction, followed by complete nucleotide sequence analysis.
 Three different types of novel single base substitutions and a 2 base-pair nucleotide deletion were identified.
 Patient HB-5 had two point mutations in his factor IX gene.
 One was located at the promoter region at nucleotide -793 and the other (C-to-T transition) was found in exon VI of the gene changing Gln-191 to a stop codon.
 Patient HB-6 had a point mutation (G-to-A) in the splice acceptor site, which interrupted the normal splicing of the last intron G.
 A small two-nucleotide deletion in exon III was detected in patient HB-7 and yielded frameshifted amino acids and terminated by a stop codon.
 These resuslts suggest that not only the gross gene deletion of factor IX gene but also the point mutations or small nucleotide deletion that may cause the interruption of coding informations for mature protein synthesis is predisposed to development of anti-factor IX inhibitors in patients with hemophilia B.

 Because there are both treatable and untreatable causes of dementia, the physician's ability to conduct (or refer a patient for) a differential diagnosis could have a profound effect on health outcomes for patients and on health care costs.
 This study was undertaken to assess physician practices with regard to the diagnosis of dementing disorders.
 Data from 53 physicians (a response rate of 48%) in several specialties were obtained from a self-administered mail questionnaire.
 Results indicate that the majority of physicians provided history taking, physical examination, and neurological examination.
 Physicians were more likely to refer patients for psychiatric and neuropsychological examinations than to provide these services themselves.
 The results also point to deficiencies in two key areas: the use of formal, published diagnostic criteria, and the use of mental status and cognitive function tests.
 Over 75% of physicians surveyed did not use either DSM-III or NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria, and 42% of physicians did not provide any mental status tests themselves.

386,"Childhood traumas: an outline and overview 
 Childhood psychic trauma appears to be a crucial etiological factor in the development of a number of serious disorders both in childhood and in adulthood.
 Like childhood rheumatic fever, psychic trauma sets a number of different problems into motion, any of which may lead to a definable mental condition.
 The author suggests four characteristics related to childhood trauma that appear to last for long periods of life, no matter what diagnosis the patient eventually receives.
 These are visualized or otherwise repeatedly perceived memories of the traumatic event, repetitive behaviors, trauma-specific fears, and changed attitudes about people, life, and the future.
 She divides childhood trauma into two basic types and defines the findings that can be used to characterize each of these types.
 Type I trauma includes full, detailed memories, ""omens,"" and misperceptions.
 Type II trauma includes denial and numbing, self-hypnosis and dissociation, and rage.
 Crossover conditions often occur after sudden, shocking deaths or accidents that leave children handicapped.
 In these instances, characteristics of both type I and type II childhood traumas exist side by side.
 There may be considerable sadness.
 Each finding of childhood trauma discussed by the author is illustrated with one or two case examples.

387,"Protective effect of increased glycolytic substrate against systolic and diastolic dysfunction and increased coronary resistance from prolonged global underperfusion and reperfusion in isolated rabbit hearts perfused with erythrocyte suspensions.
 Current therapy of myocardial infarction may include early reperfusion.
 We simulated myocardial perfusion conditions during evolving myocardial infarction in isolated, normothermic, isovolumic rabbit hearts perfused with buffer containing bovine red blood cells (hematocrit of 40%), and we assessed the effects of high levels of glucose and insulin as ""therapy"" during prolonged (150-minute) severe underperfusion and reperfusion.
 Protocol 1 consisted of underperfusion at a constant coronary perfusion pressure of 8 mm Hg.
 The control group (n = 8) received 5.5 mmol/l glucose and 15 microunits/ml insulin; the group treated with high levels of glucose and insulin (G + I) (n = 8) received 19.5 mmol/l glucose and 250 microunits/ml insulin during both underperfusion and reperfusion.
 Relative to the control group, the G + I group experienced 1) greater developed pressure during underperfusion and increased recovery during reperfusion, 2) preserved diastolic function during underperfusion and reperfusion, 3) lower coronary resistance and greater coronary flow during the underperfusion period, 4) increased glycolytic flux and preserved glycogen stores and high energy phosphate levels, and 5) less loss of myocyte enzymes (creatine kinase and alanine aminotransferase).
 In protocol 2, coronary flow was kept identical in control (n = 8) and G + I hearts (n = 8) during the underperfusion period, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was kept below 10 mm Hg in both groups to minimize subendocardial damage and vascular compression.
 In this protocol, the effect of the G + I intervention in the prevention of an increase in coronary resistance during the underperfusion period was distinguished from its myocellular metabolic effects; the high G + I substrate had protective effects on mechanical and metabolic function that were less marked than, but similar to, those in protocol 1, indicating that its mechanisms of protection during underperfusion affected both cardiac function and coronary resistance.
 We conclude that the G + I intervention, in clinically relevant concentrations, markedly protected severely underperfused myocardium for 150 minutes and may be a beneficial intervention in combination with reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction.

 Forty-seven patients with 50 clinically occult injuries of major arteries were studied prospectively to determine the natural history of these lesions and the safety of nonoperative management.
 Penetrating trauma was the predominant mechanism and lower extremity arteries were most commonly involved.
 The morphology of these arterial injuries included 22 cases of intimal flaps, 21 cases of segmental arterial narrowing, 6 pseudoaneurysms, and 1 acute arteriovenous fistula.
 There was one death as a result of unrelated causes and another three injuries operated on immediately after arteriographic diagnosis.
 The remaining 46 injuries were followed up nonoperatively by serial arteriography (39) or clinical examination (7) during a mean interval of 3.1 months (range, 3 days to 27 months).
 Complete resolution was documented for 29 injuries (63%), whereas 3 improved, 9 remained unchanged, and 5 worsened during the period of follow-up.
 All worsened cases involved small or occult pseudoaneurysms that subsequently enlarged and then underwent immediate surgical repair without subsequent morbidity.
 Because 89% of the followed injuries never required surgery, nonoperative observation appears to be a safe and effective management option for clinically occult arterial injuries.

 A new, computerized segmentation technique, in which magnetic resonance (MR) imaging produces accurate volumetric measurements of brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) without the limitations of computed tomography, was used in a retrospective analysis of digitized T2-weighted MR images of 16 healthy elderly control subjects and 16 patients with Alzheimer dementia.
 Ventricular and extraventricular CSF was quantified, and the effects of aging were studied; in both groups, the atrophy measurement was used to correct metabolic values obtained with positron emission tomography.
 Patients with Alzheimer dementia had higher total CSF; extraventricular, total ventricular, and third ventricular CSF volumes (49%, 37%, 99%, and 74%, respectively); and 7% lower brain volumes than the control group.
 The patients also showed a more marked decline in brain volumes and a greater increase in CSF volumes with advancing age than the control group.
 They had a 25.0% increase in corrected whole-brain metabolic rates; the control group had only a 15.8% increase.

 Five of six tumors were estrogen receptor negative; three analyzed for progesterone receptor were positive.
 Histologic patterns present in varying proportions were ""classic"" secretory carcinoma with microacini, abundant secretion with papillary features, and with prominent solid and papillary apocrine features.
 The tumors had strong reactivity for alpha-lactalbumin, S100, and carcinoembryonic antigen (polyclonal) and were negative for gross cystic disease fluid protein and anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (monoclonal).

 We believe this kind of tumours are ductal or lobular carcinomas with focal or more extensive neuroendocrine features and are the result of a dual differentiation of neoplastic precursor stem cells along epithelial and endocrine lines.
 Consequently, we consider that treatment of such cases should not be different from that of the ordinary type of mammary carcinomas.

392,"Dopamine and high-dose insulin infusion (glucose-insulin-potassium) after a cardiac operation: effects on myocardial metabolism.
 Myocardial insulin resistance, in association with surgical stress, restricts the availability of carbohydrates and increases the load of free fatty acids (FFAs) on the heart.
 On theoretical grounds adrenergic drugs may be expected to aggravate this situation, whereas the opposite is expected from insulin.
 The influence of dopamine and a combination of dopamine (7 micrograms/kg body weight/min) and high-dose insulin (7 IU/kg) on myocardial energy metabolism was studied in 19 patients 4 to 6 hours after a coronary operation.
 Infusion of dopamine (7 micrograms/kg body weight/min) induced metabolic changes that may be unfavorable to the strained myocardium.
 There was an increase of the myocardial FFA load and a rise in myocardial oxygen expenditure by 60% to 70%.
 There changes were, however, not matched by an increase in myocardial substrate uptake.
 ""Oxygen wastage"" of FFA metabolism at high circulating catecholamine levels is suggested.
 There were also signs suggesting an amplified systemic trauma response: systemic oxygen consumption increased by 15%, and an increase in the arterial levels of FFAs, glucose, and ketones was observed.
 Divergent metabolic effects of dopamine and insulin were demonstrated.
 The most prominent metabolic effects of adding high-dose insulin to dopamine were a marked reduction of arterial FFA levels and a shift toward myocardial carbohydrate utilization at the expense of FFAs.
 Myocardial uptake of FFAs ceased.
 Myocardial insulin resistance may thus to a significant extent be overcome by supraphysiological doses of insulin, even during infusion of adrenergic drugs.

 BACKGROUND.
 Previous studies have shown that global left ventricular function is depressed after myocardial infarction.
 However, little is known about the effects of myocardial infarction on contractility and the passive-elastic properties of residual myocardium.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 We evaluated isometric function and passive myocardial stiffness in isolated, noninfarcted left ventricular papillary muscle from rats 6 weeks after sham operation or myocardial infarction.
 Maximal developed tension and peak rate of tension rise (+dT/dt) were significantly decreased in untreated rats with large myocardial infarction compared with controls (3.3 +/- 1.1 versus 4.3 +/- 0.6 g/mm2 and 49.5 +/- 17.5 versus 72.5 +/- 10.5 g/mm2/sec, respectively).
 Time to peak tension was prolonged (120 +/- 8 versus 102 +/- 4 msec) and myocardial stiffness was increased in untreated myocardial infarction rats compared with controls (35.2 +/- 4.9 versus 24.2 +/- 3.7).
 Rats with smaller myocardial infarctions differed from controls only with respect to a prolongation of time to peak tension.
 Papillary muscle myocyte cross-sectional area was increased by 44% (p less than 0.05), and myocardial hydroxyproline content was increased by 160% (p less than 0.05) in rats with large myocardial infarctions compared with controls.
 To determine whether treatment that improves left ventricular function after myocardial infarction also improves myocardial function, rats were treated with captopril beginning 3 weeks after myocardial infarction and continuing for 3 weeks.
 Treatment with captopril attenuated the prolongation in time to peak tension in the myocardial infarction rats; however, developed tension, +dT/dt, and muscle stiffness remained abnormal.
 Compared with untreated myocardial infarction rats, captopril-treated myocardial infarction rats had a 9% decrease in myocyte cross-sectional area (p = 0.1) but a persistent increase in myocardial collagen content.
 In summary, large myocardial infarction in rats causes contractile dysfunction, increased stiffness, myocyte hypertrophy, and increased collagen content in the residual noninfarcted myocardium.
 Treatment with captopril alters the process of cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy and improves one parameter of contractility in noninfarcted myocardium; however, myocardial collagen content and myocardial stiffness remain abnormal.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 These findings suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in the rat infarct model of heart failure improves global cardiac performance via combined effects on myocardial function and the peripheral circulation.

 Randomly selected specimens from the left ventricle after 45-60 min reperfusion were prepared for transmission electron microscopy.
 Volume fractions of myocardial structural components were calculated from stereologic point-counting on the electron micrographs.
 Two-way analysis of variance revealed that interstitial edema developed with increasing ischemic time and was not influenced by reperfusion technique.
 The degree of endothelial damage was independent of ischemic time, but was lessened by 'gentle' reperfusion.

 Forty-one patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) were subjected to a dexamethasone suppression test (DST) before surgery.
 Serum cortisol and urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids were suppressed by dexamethasone in 39 patients [DST(+)].
 In two patients (cases A and B), they were not suppressed [DST(-)].
 Clinical manifestations of the two DST(-) patients were similar to those of DST(+) patients.
 Hypertension, hypokalemia, high serum aldosterone levels, and suppressed PRA were found in all of the patients.
 The cut surfaces of the adenomas from all of the patients, including cases A and B, were golden yellow, which is typical of APA.
 However, atrophies of the adjacent normal tissues were evident exclusively in the two DST(-) patients.
 After removal of the affected adrenals, the serum cortisol level was suppressed by dexamethasone in one of the DST(-) patients (case B).
 These findings suggested autonomous cortisol production by APA.
 To evaluate whether cortisol could be produced from the adenoma tissue, the presence of several steroidogenic enzymes was studied by immunohistochemistry and mRNA analysis in the adenomas and the adjacent nonneoplastic adrenals from the 2 DST(-) and 5 DST(+) patients.
 Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that steroidogenic enzymes were expressed in APA tumor tissues from both DST(-) and DST(+) patients.
 In both groups, mRNAs coding steroidogenic enzymes were present not only in the nonneoplastic but also in the tumor tissues.
 Quantitative analysis of the mRNA levels revealed that in the adrenals from DST(+) patients, the mRNAs were more abundant in nonneoplastic tissue than in tumor tissue.
 However, in those from DST(-) cases, the mRNAs were much more abundant in the tumor tissues than in the nonneoplastic tissues.
 These results indicate that tumor cells of the two DST(-) patients autonomously synthesized not only aldosterone but also cortisol.
 The diameters of the tumors from the two DST(-) patients exceeded 3 cm, while those from other DST(+) patients were smaller.
 In patients with large APA, adrenal insufficiency should be anticipated upon removal of the tumor.

 In 81% (21/26) of the patients, 1073 MBq ablated after the first dose, 77% (21/26 + 3/5 = 24/31) after the first plus second dose, and 69% (24/31 + 0/4 = 24/35) after the first, second, and third dose.

400,"Regurgitant jet size by transesophageal compared with transthoracic Doppler color flow imaging.
 Combined echocardiography and Doppler color flow mapping from transthoracic imaging windows has become the standard method for the noninvasive assessment of valvular regurgitation.
 This study compared regurgitant jet areas by Doppler color flow imaging derived from the newer transesophageal approach with measurements obtained from conventional transthoracic apical views.
 Maximal regurgitant jet area determinations and an overall visual estimate of lesion severity were obtained from 42 patients who underwent color flow examination by both techniques.
 Seventy-three regurgitant lesions were visualized by transesophageal flow imaging: 34 mitral, 22 aortic, and 17 tricuspid jets.
 Transthoracic studies in the same patients revealed fewer regurgitant lesions for each valve; 20 mitral, 16 aortic, and 12 tricuspid (p = 0.0009).
 A comparison of maximal jet areas determined by transesophageal and transthoracic studies showed a good overall correlation (r = 0.85, SEE = 2.8 cm2) and a systematic overestimation by the transesophageal technique (TEE = 0.96 TTX + 2.7).
 For the subgroup with mitral insufficiency, valve lesions visualized by both techniques were larger by the transesophageal approach (n = 18, 6.0 versus 3.6 cm2, p = 0.008).
 Semiquantitative visual grading of individual valve lesions by two independent observers revealed a higher grade of regurgitation with more jets classified as mild (38 versus 25), moderate (18 versus 13), and severe (17 versus 10) by esophageal imaging than by transthoracic imaging.
 Thus, transesophageal color flow mapping techniques yield a higher prevalence of valvular regurgitation than do transthoracic techniques in the same patients.
 Jet area and the overall estimate of regurgitant lesion severity were also greater by transesophageal color Doppler imaging compared with standard transthoracic imaging.

401,"The Merkel cell and associated neoplasms in the eyelids and periocular region.
 Merkel cells are clear oval cells in the epidermis and outer root sheaths of hair follicles, which are probably of epithelial origin, share ultrastructural features with neuroendocrine cells, and are found in association with touch receptors.
 In the eyelid, they occur singly in the epidermis and external root sheaths of hairs and eyelashes, and in specialized touch spots alternating with eyelashes.
 Their typical electron microscopical and antigenic features include dense-core granules, intranuclear rodlets, spinous processes, and a positive reaction for specific cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and synaptophysin.
 Merkel cell carcinoma probably develops from precursor cells which give rise to keratinocytes and Merkel cells, and nearly one out of ten Merkel cell carcinomas occur in the eyelid and periocular region.
 They tend to be bulging lesions near the lid margin of elderly patients, reddish in color, and erythematous with telangiectatic vessels.
 The diagnosis is based on the frequent presence of neurofilaments and paranuclear aggregates of intermediate filaments in addition to features typical of normal Merkel cells.
 The tumor often mimics lymphoma or undifferentiated carcinoma and frequently invades lymphatic vessels.
 One third of Merkel cell carcinomas recur, almost two thirds give rise to regional node metastases, and up to one half metastasize widely and result in death.
 Initial treatment should be prompt and aggressive, with wide resection and routine postoperative irradiation.
 Although metastatic lesions often respond to radiation therapy and cytostatic drugs, these treatments are mainly of palliative value.

 The purpose of this study was to determine if the state of physical training influences sympathetic neural activation during acute stress in humans.
 We recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography of the peroneal nerve), arterial blood pressure, and heart rate in 12 highly trained, endurance athletes (25 +/- 1 years, mean +/- SEM) and 12 untrained subjects (27 +/- 1 years) before (supine rest control) and during: 1) lower body negative pressure at -5, -10, -15, and -20 mm Hg (orthostatic stress); 2) isometric handgrip at 30% of maximum (exercise stress); and 3) hand immersion in ice water, that is, the cold pressor test (thermal stress).

 Conflicting reports exist in the literature on the effectiveness of topical local anesthetic applied to the serosal surface of the fallopian tubes for the control of immediate postoperative pain after mechanical (band or clip) tubal ligation.
 Sixty-four patients were studied prospectively during outpatient laparoscopic Falope ring tubal ligation using the modified McGill Present Pain Intensity Scale.
 Patients randomly assigned to four groups received topical bupivacaine hydrochloride on both fallopian tubes, the right tube only, or the left tube only, or received none (controls).
 A unique study design was incorporated which allowed the untreated fallopian tube to serve as a within-subject control for each patient receiving unilateral treatment.
 Statistical analysis confirmed significant benefit when both fallopian tubes were treated as compared with no treatment (P less than .05).
 There was also consistent evidence of decreased immediate postoperative pain perception on the treated side for patients receiving unilateral treatment.
 The value of topical bupivacaine was demonstrated by both subjective patient response (McGill Pain Scale) and reduced need for pain medication before outpatient discharge.
 Our data support the value of topical bupivacaine applied to the serosal surface of the fallopian tubes for the reduction of postoperative pain after outpatient laparoscopic mechanical (band or clip) tubal ligation.

 Chromogranin A, co-stored and co-released with catecholamines from adrenal medullary and sympathetic neuronal vesicles, is elevated in the plasma of patients with pheochromocytoma.
 The usefulness of the hormone in the differential diagnosis of hypertension is examined.
 An elevated level of chromogranin A had comparable diagnostic sensitivity (83%, 24/29) to, but greater diagnostic specificity (96%, 86/90) than the level of plasma catecholamines when subjects with pheochromocytoma (n = 29) were evaluated in comparison to several reference groups, including normotensive controls (n = 49), subjects with essential hypertension (n = 28), subjects with renovascular hypertension (n = 5), and subjects with primary aldosteronism (n = 3).
 Subjects with signs or symptoms suggesting pheochromocytoma, but in whom the diagnosis was ultimately ruled out (n = 5) had normal plasma levels of chromogranin A.
 A modest rise in chromogranin A in those with essential hypertension, and correlation of chromogranin A with diastolic blood pressure in normotensive patients and patients with essential hypertension did not impair the diagnostic usefulness of chromogranin A for pheochromocytoma.
 Renal failure was associated with an elevated plasma chromogranin A independently of blood pressure.
 Plasma chromogranin A correlated with tumor mass, tumor chromogranin A content, tumor norepinephrine content, and urinary vanillylmandelic acid excretion; it did not correlate with plasma or urinary catecholamines, nor with blood pressure in patients with pheochromocytoma.
 Plasma chromogranin A levels did not differ in subjects with pheochromocytoma when stratified by age, sex, tumor location, or tumor pathology.
 Several drugs used in the diagnosis or treatment of pheochromocytoma (clonidine, metoprolol, phentolamine, and tyramine) had little effect on plasma chromogranin A concentration.
 Within the pheochromocytoma, chromogranin A was localized along with catecholamines to the soluble core of chromaffin granules, where it accounted for 18 +/- 5% of vesicle soluble protein.
 We conclude that 1) chromogranin A emerges along with catecholamines from pheochromocytoma chromaffin granules; 2) plasma chromogranin A is a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool in evaluation of actual or suspected pheochromocytoma; 3) plasma chromogranin A predicts pheochromocytoma tumor size and overall catecholamine production; and 4) drugs commonly employed in the diagnosis or treatment of pheochromocytoma have little effect on plasma chromogranin A level, preserving the usefulness of chromogranin A in evaluating pheochromocytoma.
 Thus, measurement of chromogranin A provides a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.

 Lymphocele is a well recognized complication of renal transplant surgery.
 We performed a retrospective review of 305 renal transplant patients with over 2,500 scintigraphic exams to describe the pattern of activity on technetium-99m-DTPA blood flow and dynamic imaging, and iodine-131-OIH studies.
 Diagnostic criteria for a lymphocele were ultrasonic evidence of a perirenal fluid collection and analysis of that fluid that demonstrated BUN, creatinine, and electrolytes similar to the patient's plasma.
 Scintigraphic findings were attributed to a lymphocele if abnormalities were in the same area as the ultrasound fluid collection.
 Scintigraphic findings attributable to lymphocele resolved in all patients following surgical drainage or peritoneal window placement.
 Six of the 11 documented lymphoceles demonstrated a cold defect on initial dynamic images that ""filled in"" to equal background activity and another exceeded background.
 Three cases showed a rim of increased activity surrounding the lymphocele (""rim sign"").

 In a controlled, double-blind, crossover study, the effects of guanadrel sulfate and propranolol on blood pressure (BP) and selected cardiopulmonary and metabolic variables were compared in 15 physically active and moderately hypertensive subjects.
 Guanadrel sulfate reduced systolic and diastolic BP at rest by -16 and -15 mm Hg, and at maximal exercise by -33 and -13 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.005), without affecting submaximal oxygen consumption (VO2), maximal VO2, ventilatory threshold, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or fatigue, as assessed by perceived exertion.
 In contrast, propranolol significantly decreased diastolic BP at rest (-16 mm Hg) and systolic BP at maximal exercise (-44 mm Hg); however, it significantly decreased submaximal VO2 (-3.9 ml.kg-1.min-1), maximal VO2 (-3.9 ml.kg-1.min-1), ventilatory threshold (-0.3 liters.min-1), minute ventilation at submaximal exercise (-7.3 liters.min-1), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (-0.27 liters), and concomitantly increased the rating of perceived exertion at maximal exercise (1.9 U).
 Guanadrel sulfate was also associated with significant decreases in mean fasting plasma glucose and total serum cholesterol, whereas propranolol resulted in an increase in serum triglycerides (p less than 0.05).
 In contrast to propranolol, guanadrel sulfate appears to decrease BP without evoking negative metabolic consequences or impairing exercise tolerance.

 High dosages of tocopherol and ascorbate were administered to patients with early Parkinson's disease as a preliminary open-labeled trial for the eventual controlled double-blind study evaluating antioxidants as a test of the endogenous toxin hypothesis of the etiology of Parkinson's disease.
 The primary endpoint of the trial was the need to treat patients with levodopa.
 The time when levodopa became necessary in the treated patients was compared with another group of patients followed elsewhere and not taking antioxidants.
 The time when levodopa became necessary was extended by 2.5 y in the group taking antioxidants.
 The results of this pilot study suggest that the progression of Parkinson's disease may be slowed by the administration of these antioxidants.

 The course of 357 balloon inflations performed during 38 angioplasties for single-vessel coronary artery disease was prospectively studied using continuous ECG recording.
 Ischemic ECG changes appeared during 91 percent of the inflations at a mean of 20 +/- 8 seconds after inflation and resolved in 97 percent of those at a mean of 11 +/- 5 seconds after deflation.
 Elevation of the plasma CPK level was found in six patients who had ischemic ECG changes for at least 7.8 minutes.
 The duration of ischemia did not exceed 5.4 minutes in any of the patients without CPK elevation.
 Resolution of the ischemic changes was delayed in patients with CPK elevation and in last vs initial inflations.
 We conclude that in patients with noninfarcted myocardium, ECG changes follow coronary occlusion and reflow very rapidly, detecting these coronary events with a high sensitivity.
 Lack of rapid regression predicts lack of reperfusion, and persistence of ischemia for more than 7.8 minutes is sufficient to cause myocardial necrosis.

 Previous research has documented high rates of major depression and antisocial personality in opiate addicts.
 This study was designed to investigate the relationship of dual diagnosis in opiate-addicted probands to family history of psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders in biological relatives.
 Psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders were evaluated using direct interview and family history in a sample of 877 first-degree relatives of 201 opiate addicts and 360 relatives of 82 normal controls.
 Results indicate that (1) compared with relatives of normal subjects, opiate addicts' relatives had substantially higher rates of alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and antisocial personality; (2) relatives of depressed opiate-addicted probands had elevated rates of major depression and anxiety disorders but not of other disorders, suggesting the validity of subtyping opiate addicts by the presence or absence of major depression; and (3) in contrast, relatives of antisocial opiate addicts had rates of disorders that were not significantly different from those of relatives of opiate addicts without antisocial personality.
 Implications of these findings for the classification and treatment of substance abuse are discussed.

411,"Alcohol consumption and synthesis of ethyl esters of fatty acids in adipose tissue.
 Ethyl esters of fatty acids (EEFA) have been found to be formed during ethanol metabolism.
 Human adipose tissue contains high concentrations of free fatty acids, the substrate for EEFA synthesis, and might therefore be a tissue with great potential for EEFA formation.
 In order to explore their potential usefulness as markers of alcohol abuse, the EEFA concentration and the activity of EEFA-synthesizing enzyme were therefore determined in adipose tissue from men belonging to the following categories: teetotalers, social drinkers, alcoholics under treatment, or established alcoholics found to have died as a result of alcohol intoxication.
 In order to estimate the half-life of EEFA and the synthase activity induction, the alcoholics were examined after different time periods of abstinence from alcohol.
 Comparisons were also made with several established markers of alcohol abuse.
 EEFA were not found in teetotalers, and were found in low concentrations in some of the social drinkers.
 EEFA were found in several alcoholics, and the forensic cases had high concentrations.
 EEFA-synthesizing enzyme activity was found in all subjects, increasing from teetotalers to social drinkers, and being 2-fold higher in alcoholics and 5-fold higher in dead alcoholics.
 The induction of the enzyme after abstinence appeared to have a half-life of the order of several weeks.
 Correlations were found between EEFA synthase activity and previously established markers of alcohol abuse known to remain for a long time period after abstinence, such as mean erythrocyte corpuscular volume.
 This preliminary study suggests the possibility that EEFA synthase induction in adipose tissue might have a longer half-life than previously used markers of alcohol abuse.
 It is therefore suggested that the induction of EEFA synthase might be a potentially useful new marker for alcohol abuse because of its apparent proportionality to alcohol intake over a prolonged time period, its presumed specificity, and long-term elevation after alcohol abstinence.
 This potential marker should be analysed further.

 While thrombus formation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of unstable angina, the value of thrombus-related markers for distinguishing unstable from stable angina is not well defined.
 Fibrin D-dimer and plasminogen activator inhibitor were prospectively analyzed in the peripheral blood of 46 patients (26 with unstable angina and 20 with stable angina or normal coronary arteries).
 Baseline blood samples were drawn within 24 h after rest pain in patients with unstable angina and in 19 of these 26 patients in less than 6 h.
 In patients with unstable angina, mean +/- SD (median) values for fibrin D-dimer and plasminogen activator inhibitor values measured 0.09 +/- 0.06 (0.07) microgram/ml and 9.1 +/- 9.6 (5.9) IU, respectively, compared to 0.11 +/- 0.10 (0.05) microgram/ml and 5.5 +/- 1.9 (5.0) IU/ml, in patients in the control group (p = NS for all comparisons between the two groups).
 Recurrent in-hospital pain, coronary anatomy and need for intervention showed no relation to the levels of these markers.
 In 19 additional patients (9 with unstable angina and 10 control patients) samples from the coronary sinus and the peripheral blood were also analyzed.
 Again, in patients with unstable angina all samples were drawn less than 24 h after rest pain; in six of nine patients samples were drawn in less than 6 h.

 There were significant differences in coping styles and personality characteristics between alcoholics and nonalcoholics and, to a large extent, between men and women within the alcoholic group.
 Practically no significant differences were found between the men in the two groups, but female alcoholics differed greatly from nonalcoholic women in terms of coping styles, personality variables and also in terms of conflict.
 These findings indicate that the differences between alcoholic and nonalcoholics in the sample were due largely to patterns uniquely characterizing the female alcoholic group.

 Cardiac pacing initiated from epicardial or transvenous apical right ventricular electrodes causes asynchronous ventricular contraction.
 This alters myocardial stress vectors and results in adverse cellular and subcellular changes in the experimental animal.
 Clinically, such changes may contribute to the adverse hemodynamics reported with long-term ventricular pacing.
 To determine the feasibility of direct stimulation of the ventricular specialized conduction systems and therefore the potential for maintenance of normalized depolarization patterns, 13 beagle puppies were studied.
 Baseline ventricular activation and contraction patterns were obtained using intracardiac electrograms and multigated nuclear acquisition (MUGA) imaging.
 Septal electrode insertion from the aortoatrial groove was accomplished by use of two-dimensional echocardiography and continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring of the surface ECG during pacemaker implantation in five puppies.
 Standard right ventricular epicardial electrodes were implanted in five additional animals, with three remaining as age-matched non-paced controls.
 After 4 months of observation, repeat MUGA imaging and intracardiac electrograms demonstrated nearly normal biventricular activation and contraction patterns among the septal-paced group.
 Histopathologic examination illustrated normal cellular morphology in the septal-paced animals.
 This study demonstrates that pacing electrode insertion into the proximal interventricular septum is feasible and results in utilization of the normal ventricular conduction pathway.
 Such an approach to initiation of ventricular stimulation may attenuate the adverse effects of long-term ventricular pacing.

 Mitral regurgitation (MR) was evaluated by Doppler echocardiography in 59 patients with mitral stenosis before, immediately after and 1 year after balloon mitral valvuloplasty (BMV).
 The severity of MR was graded on a scale from 1+ to 4+.
 Echocardiographic and hemodynamic variables were analyzed to study the potential factor(s) that might predict the long-term persistence of MR.
 Echocardiographic variables were mitral valve thickness and motion, subvalvular change, left atrial dimension, commissural calcification and effective balloon/mitral anular diameters.
 Hemodynamic variables were mitral pressure gradient, pulmonary arterial pressure, ejection fraction, mitral valve area index, age, gender and cardiac rhythm.
 Mitral valve area index increased from 0.9 +/- 0.5 to 1.5 +/- 0.8 cm2/m2 immediately after BMW, and to 1.4 +/- 0.3 cm2/m2 at 1 year follow-up (p less than 0.01).
 Immediately after BMV, MR grading did not change in 30 patients (51%), increased by 1+ in 23 patients (39%), by 2+ in 2 patients (3.3%) and by 3+ in 2 patients (3.3%), and decreased by 1+ in 2 others.
 At 1-year follow-up, only 1 patient with severe MR required valve replacement.
 Fifty-one patients (88%) had no change in the extent of MR (less than or equal to 1+) and 6 patients (10%) had a 1-grade decrease in their MR; only 1 patient had a 1-grade increase in MR.
 No clinical or hemodynamic variables or morphologic characteristics of the mitral valve could predict the development of significant MR after BMV.

 The effects of reversal of flunitrazepam-induced sedation with flumazenil on coronary hemodynamics, myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2), and left ventricular (LV) performance were investigated, in a double-blind trial, in 12 patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization.
 Coronary sinus blood flow was measured by continuous thermodilution.
 Arterial and coronary sinus blood were analyzed for oxygen and lactate contents.
 The determinants of LV performance were obtained from the cardiac output measured by thermodilution and from left heart catheterization data.
 To reverse flunitrazepam-induced sedation, patients were randomly allocated to receive placebo or flumazenil (by increment, up to 1 mg) at the end of procedure.
 In the placebo group, no significant hemodynamic changes were observed.
 In the flumazenil group, heart rate, cardiac index, maximum velocity of shortening, and relaxation time constant were not significantly altered.
 By contrast, mean aortic pressure and LV end-diastolic pressure (baselines: 90 +/- 5 and 7.3 +/- 4.1 mmHg, respectively) increased (9%, P less than 0.05 and 67%, P less than 0.05, respectively) after flumazenil administration, but these changes represented mainly a return toward presedation values.
 MVO2 and coronary resistance were not significantly altered, whereas CSBF increased slightly (baseline: 119 +/- 20 ml/min; increase 10%, P less than 0.05).
 No electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia was observed during the study.
 These data show that reversal of benzodiazepine effects with flumazenil is not associated with a major alteration of LV systolic function, relaxation, or coronary hemodynamics in patients with coronary artery disease.
 Nevertheless, it should be cautiously used when LV end-diastolic pressure is increased at the time of its administration.

 Local changes in cerebral glucose utilization during the postictal phase of amygdaloid-kindled generalized seizures were studied with the quantitative autoradiographic 2-[14C]deoxyglucose method in conscious rats.
 Measurement was initiated either just after termination of a behavioral seizure (GS-I) or 30 s after seizure termination (GS-II) to determine dynamic metabolic changes in the postictal phase.
 Although glucose utilization of the neocortex was remarkably depressed in both GS-I and GS-II, that of the hippocampus significantly increased in GS-I and then decreased in GS-II as compared with control.
 These changes of hippocampal glucose utilization were observed in all sectors of the pyramidal cell layer (CA 1-4) and in the molecular layer.
 Because metabolic changes associated with development of amygdaloid-kindled seizures begin in the limbic structures including the hippocampus, the transient increase in hippocampal glucose utilization observed in the early postictal phase indicates that the hippocampus is one of the key structures not only for initiating and maintaining but also for terminating kindled seizures.

 Overall QL ratings were not strongly associated with objective indicators such as demographic characteristics and use of health care services.
 Subjective indicators, including patient perceptions of health, memory, and financial concerns, were correlated independently with global QL (sigma R2 = .35).

 Muscle tone in the upper and lower extremities was assessed by Ashworth scores both before the injections and every 2 hours afterward for 8 hours.
 Function of the upper extremities was evaluated before the injections and 4 hours afterward.
 Muscle tone in the lower extremities was significantly decreased within 2 hours after baclofen injection and remained lower than baseline 8 hours afterward.
 Upper extremity tone and function were not significantly affected by these single doses.
 Confusion and drowsiness occurred in two of the youngest children in the study after the 50-micrograms dose, but cleared within 2 hours.
 Our findings indicate that intrathecal baclofen reduces spasticity in children with cerebral palsy, as it does in adults with spasticity of spinal origin.

425,"Current strategies in the management of locoregional and metastatic gastric carcinoma.
 Gastric carcinoma remains a significant cause of death worldwide.
 A patient's prognosis depends on the degree of gastric wall penetration, presence of lymph node metastases, and location of the primary site.
 Metastatic gastric carcinoma is currently incurable.
 However, chemotherapy continues to evolve at a rapid pace.
 Active agents include 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin, cisplatin, methotrexate, mitomycin, and etoposide.
 Combination etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (EAP) has been reported to result in encouragingly high response rates, including a 10% complete response rate in patients with metastatic gastric carcinoma.
 Trials are now under way to confirm these results.
 Similarly, another etoposide-based combination, etoposide, leucovorin, and 5-FU (ELF), has resulted in an equally good response rate but less toxicity than EAP.
 The 5-FU, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (FAMTX) regimen, previously reported to have an excellent response rate, is also being investigated further.
 For patients with locoregional carcinoma, curative resection rate is often unsatisfactorily low; however, curative resection is consistently associated with improved survival (between 23 and 26 months).
 In patients with potentially resectable carcinoma, two significant problems must be recognized: (1) a low rate of curative resection and (2) the development of widespread carcinoma despite curative resection.
 Despite many attempts, the postoperative strategies of adjuvant chemotherapy have been ineffective.
 New strategies must be investigated aggressively.
 Combination etoposide, 5-FU, and cisplatin (EFP) has been administered preoperatively and postoperatively to patients with resectable gastric carcinoma, resulting in an encouraging curative resection rate (greater than 70%) and manageable toxicity.
 Based on promising results reported with EAP in patients with unresectable locoregional carcinoma of the stomach, a trial of preoperative and postoperative EAP in potentially resectable carcinoma of the stomach is now under way.

 We describe a chemosensitivity testing of head and neck tumors, in which a native-state histoculture, ie, a three-dimensional culture system that maintains important in vivo properties, including tissue architecture, was used.
 Fifteen specimens of head and neck tumors were evaluated for sensitivity to the following drugs: cisplatin (DDP) at concentrations of 1.5, 15, and 37.5 micrograms/mL; fluorouracil at concentrations of 4.0, 40, and 100 micrograms/mL; and combinations of cisplatin and fluorouracil in corresponding doses.
 Growth and measurement of drug responses were successfully completed in 10 specimens (five others were contaminated, four of them prior to instituting rigorous antibiotic washes).
 The results indicated cisplatin sensitivity in five of 10 patients; fluorouracil sensitivity in four of 10 patients; and fluorouracil-cisplatin sensitivity in seven of eight patients.
 Our preliminary results indicate that the native-state histoculture technique is feasible to test chemosensitivity of head and neck tumors.

427,"A comparison of three formulations of TAC (tetracaine, adrenalin, cocaine) for anesthesia of minor lacerations in children.
 A randomized, prospective, double-blind study comparing three formulations of the topical anesthetic solution TAC for laceration repair was undertaken in 250 children.
 The children's wounds were anesthetized with either TAC I (original formulation--0.5% tetracaine, 1:2000 Adrenalin, 11.8% cocaine), TAC II (1.0% tetracaine, 1:4000 Adrenalin, 7.0% cocaine), or TAC III (1.0% tetracaine, 1:4000 Adrenalin, 4.0% cocaine) prior to repair.
 The solutions were compared with respect to efficacy, acceptability, wound complications, and side effects.
 We found comparable efficacy of the three formulations, with similar efficacy to 1% lidocaine infiltration for facial and scalp wounds.
 Anesthesia for extremity wounds was adequate in only 39.9% of cases, regardless of TAC strength.
 Wound complications and side effects were within expected and acceptable limits.
 Our findings support use of TAC for face and scalp lacerations and a change to a less concentrated TAC preparation, such as our ""TAC III,"" which is presumably safer for widespread use.

429,"Outcome following prolonged intensive care unit stay in multiple trauma patients.
 OBJECTIVE: To describe the hospital course and outcomes of trauma patients requiring ICU stays greater than 30 days and the charges they incur.
 DESIGN: A retrospective case series analysis of data collected from patient charts and trauma registry.
 SETTING: A Level I regional trauma center that is part of a statewide trauma system.
 PATIENTS: Over a 3-yr period, 87 patients (3% of all trauma ICU admissions) had prolonged stays (greater than 30 days) in the ICU; they constitute the study group.
 Blunt trauma was responsible for 90% of injuries, and the mean Injury Severity Score was 34 +/- 16 SD.
 RESULTS: Mechanical ventilation was required for 78.5% of the time spent in the ICU.
 The mean time spent on mechanical ventilators was 47 +/- 23 days; in the ICU, 60 +/- 27 days; and in the hospital, 72 +/- 29 days.
 Infectious complications occurred in 90% and organ dysfunction was seen in 76% of patients.
 The overall mortality rate was 17.2% (31% for patients greater than 65 yr).
 Patients less than 40 yr had lower mortality rates despite a significantly higher Injury Severity Score and lower Glasgow Coma Scale score compared with those greater than 65 yr.
 More patients greater than 65 yr were discharged to chronic care facilities than those younger (23% vs.
 5%).
 The number of patients followed at 3 and 12 months after discharge was 74% and 54%, respectively, with only two deaths.
 The mean hospital and professional charges to the patients were $101,000 +/- 61,000 and $35,000 +/- 13,000, respectively.
 CONCLUSION: Length of ICU stay was most closely associated with the need for mechanical ventilation.
 The presence of premorbid illness, age greater than 65 yr, and organ dysfunction was associated with increased mortality.
 Although trauma patients requiring prolonged ICU stays utilize many resources, the ultimate outcome may be fairly good.

430,"Intraosseous infusion of dobutamine and isoproterenol.
 Intraosseous infusion has been advocated as an emergency route in sick infants and children when intravenous access is not readily obtainable.
 Dobutamine hydrochloride and isoproterenol hydrochloride are useful emergency drugs that have not been studied when administered into the bone marrow.
 In a swine model, we compared the physiologic responses (heart rate, arterial pressure, and cardiac output) of dobutamine and isoproterenol infusions delivered intravenously and intraosseously during 20-minute intervals.
 We observed statistically significant effects of both dobutamine and isoproterenol delivered by the intraosseous route.
 In addition, the effects resulting from intraosseous infusion were statistically similar to those resulting from intravenous administration of these drugs.
 We conclude that the intraosseous infusion of dobutamine and isoproterenol is an effective and useful method for emergency administration of these medications.

435,"A long terminal repeat-containing retrotransposon is mobilized during hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis.
 A hybrid dysgenesis syndrome similar to those described in Drosophila melanogaster occurs in Drosophila virilis when a laboratory stock is crossed to a wild strain collected in the Batumi region of Georgia (U.S.S.R).
 Mutations in various loci obtained during these crosses are presumably induced by the insertion of DNA sequences.
 We have cloned an induced white mutation and characterized the insertion sequence responsible for the mutant phenotype.
 This sequence is a 10.6-kilobase (kb) transposable element we have named Ulysses.
 This element is flanked by unusually large 2.1-kb long terminal repeats.
 Ulysses also contains other landmarks characteristic of the retrotransposon family, such as a tRNA-binding site adjacent to the 5' long terminal repeat and open reading frames encoding putative products with homology to the reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase domains typical of proteins encoded by vertebrate retroviruses.
 Some of the mutations obtained do not contain a copy of the Ulysses element at the mutant locus, suggesting that a different transposable element may be responsible for the mutation.
 Therefore, Ulysses may not be the primary cause of the entire dysgenic syndrome, and its mobilization may be the result of activation by an independent mobile element.

436,"Noninvasive estimation of left atrial pressure in patients with congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation by Doppler echocardiography.
 A completely noninvasive method for estimating left atrial pressure in patients with congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation has been devised with the use of continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography and brachial sphygmomanometry.
 Of 46 patients studied with mitral regurgitation, 35 (76%) had jets with distinct Doppler spectral envelopes recorded.
 The peak ventriculoatrial gradient was obtained by measuring peak mitral regurgitant velocity in systole and using the modified Bernoulli equation.
 This gradient was then subtracted from peak brachial systolic blood pressure, an estimate of left ventricular systolic pressure, to yield left atrial pressure (left atrial pressure = systolic blood pressure - mitral regurgitant pressure gradient).
 Noninvasive estimates of left atrial pressure from 35 patients were plotted against simultaneous recordings of mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure resulting in the correlation y = 0.88x + 3.3, r = 0.88, standard error of estimate = +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001).
 Therefore, continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography and sphygmomanometry may be used in selected patients with congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation for noninvasive estimation of left atrial pressure.

 A mouse myeloma cell line MPC11 (IgG2b, kappa) and variants derived from it have been used to study DNA rearrangements that occur at the Ig H chain locus.
 One variant, F5.5, has acquired both VH gene and C epsilon gene rearrangements.
 Through genomic Southern blot analysis initially directed to mapping the C epsilon gene rearrangement, we observed that the VH region rearrangement was linked, through an inversion event, to sequences that originate 3' of the CH cluster, i.e., 3' of the C alpha gene.
 Subsequent studies have shown that DNA rearrangements within the region 3' of the C alpha gene are detected in several other mouse myeloma and hybridoma cell lines and are not associated with the expression of specific isotypes.

 The prevalence, electrophysiologic characteristics and functional significance of decremental conduction over an accessory pathway were examined in this retrospective study of 653 patients who had an accessory pathway demonstrated at electrophysiologic study.
 Decremental conduction was identified in 50 patients (7.6%).
 In 15 patients with anterograde decremental conduction, the accessory pathway was right parietal or septal in 14 patients and left parietal in 1 patient.
 In the 40 patients with retrograde decrement, the accessory pathway was left parietal in 19, posteroseptal in 13, right parietal in 2 and right anteroseptal in 6 patients.
 Anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway was absent in 11 of the 40 patients with retrograde decrement.
 Retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway was absent in 9 patients with anterograde decrement.
 There was no significant difference in the accessory pathway effective refractory period, or shortest cycle length with 1:1 conduction over the accessory pathway in anterograde and retrograde directions.
 The shortest RR interval in atrial fibrillation between 2 preexcited QRS complexes was longer in patients with anterograde decremental conduction than in a control group of patients with anterograde-conducting accessory pathways without decremental properties.
 These data demonstrate that decremental conduction over accessory pathways is uncommon.
 Anterograde decremental conduction usually occurs in right-sided or septal pathways that often do not conduct in the retrograde direction.

 The intravenous administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to three patients with leukemia who were receiving marrow aplasia-inducing chemotherapy resulted in the development of wide-spread erythematous macules and papules.
 The course of the eruption paralleled the time of infusion of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
 Skin biopsy specimens taken from two of the eruptions displayed characteristic changes consisting of a variable mixture of granulocytes and lymphocytes, increased number and size of dermal macrophages, mild to moderate epidermal exocytosis, intercellular edema, and rare dyskeratotic keratinocytes.
 Immunophenotypic analysis of one specimen was notable for keratinocyte intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression.

 Sixty-five families were enlisted in a study exploring factors associated with distress behavior in 5-year-old children receiving diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunizations.
 At a home visit 1 month before the immunization, the following measures were obtained: (1) the Behavioral Style Questionnaire, a measure of temperament: (2) parental self-reports of medically related attributes (eg.
 ""good patient""); (3) parental attitudes toward pain in children and responsiveness to their child's pain; and (4) parental prediction of distress at upcoming immunization.
 The child's distress behavior during the immunization was evaluated using a modification of the Procedure Rating Scale-Revised and, after the procedure, the child's assessment of his or her pain was elicited using the Oucher.
 Children's mean Procedure Rating Scale-Revised score was 2.57 of a possible 11.
 Thirty-one (48%) had low (less than or equal to 1) and 7 (11%) had high distress scores (greater than or equal to 2 SD above the mean).
 Factors positively correlated with distressed behavior included more ""difficult child"" cluster characteristics, the individual temperamental dimension of adaptability, but few parental attitudes and attributes.
 Parent's predictions of distress were the strongest correlates.
 These findings document the variation that children demonstrate in response to pain and offer some insight into associated innate and environmental factors.
 These results imply that treatment strategies derived from parental knowledge and tailored to individual characteristics of the child may be most effective in alleviating pain-related distress in medical settings.

 Electrical activity was recorded from single cells in the thalamus of 10 patients with chronic pain associated with deafferentation.
 Under local anesthesia, these patients underwent either electrode implantation or thalamotomy for treatment of their pain.
 In eight of the 10 patients, single units were identified as discharging spontaneously in high-frequency, often rhythmic, bursts.
 The discharges were of two types: short bursts comprised of two to six spikes with a burst frequency of one to four per second; and long trains of 30 to 80 spikes of similar frequency.
 Reconstruction of electrode trajectories indicated that recordings were made from the region corresponding to the lateral aspect of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the central lateral nucleus, a small part of the central median nucleus, and the parafascicular nucleus.
 In the eight patients in whom spontaneous neuronal burst activity was exhibited, it was impossible to study activity evoked by natural cutaneous stimulation due to the continuous spontaneous neuronal discharges.
 Both animal and human studies have suggested that pain related to deafferentation is accompanied by spontaneous hyperactivity in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the ventral posterior thalamic nuclei.
 The authors present evidence of spontaneous neuronal hyperactivity in the intralaminar thalamic nuclei of patients with pain related to deafferentation.
 The findings suggest that spontaneous neuronal discharge in patients with pain related to deafferentation is more widespread in the central nervous system than has been previously appreciated.
 The results have important implications for the surgical treatment of chronic pain.

 The influence of systolic function on pulsed Doppler echocardiographic transmitral flow velocity patterns was assessed before and after postextrasystolic (PES) potentiation in 12 normal subjects (control group) and in 25 patients with previous healed myocardial infarction (MI) group.
 Simultaneous high-fidelity left ventricular pressure measurements were performed in all patients.
 A programmed single-coupled right ventricular extrasystole was induced during echocardiographic and subsequent cineangiocardiographic recordings.
 Adequate angiograms for volumetric analysis in both baseline and PES beats were obtained in 23 patients (7 in the control group and 16 in the MI group).
 PES potentiation of contraction was more pronounced in the MI group than in the control group.
 PES changes in ejection fraction, stroke volume and end-systolic volume were significantly greater in the MI group than in the control group (11 vs 5%, p less than 0.005; 15 vs 5 ml/m2, p less than 0.005; and -13 vs -4 ml/m2, p less than 0.01, respectively).

 Magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) measurement of human plasma has been reported as a generally applicable marker for malignancy: patients with malignancy had a MRS line width significantly different from patients with benign diseases or healthy controls.
 The authors investigated the value of this test in 213 women with ovarian carcinoma, benign pelvic masses, benign nongynecologic diseases, and healthy controls.
 The MRS measurements were performed on plasma samples at 21 degrees C or 27 degrees C.
 The line width parameters were obtained by averaging the width at half the height of the methyl and methylene peaks on the resonance spectra.
 At 27 degrees C using 33 Hz as the threshold for an abnormal result, there was a significant correlation between the result of the test and the presence or absence of malignancy.
 However, the study demonstrates that the specificity (0.44) and positive predictive value (0.42) are too low for the test to be useful in the management of patients with carcinoma of the ovary.
 At 21 degrees C no correlation between the results of the test and the clinical status of women with carcinoma of the ovary were observed.

 Hypothermia is widely acknowledged to be the fundamental component of myocardial protection during cardiac operations.
 Although it prolongs the period of ischemic arrest by reducing oxygen demands, hypothermia is associated with a number of major disadvantages, including its detrimental effects on enzymatic function, energy generation, and cellular integrity.
 We hypothesized that the ideal protected state of the heart would be electromechanically arrested and perfused with blood, that is, aerobic arrest.
 Under these conditions the fundamental need for hypothermia becomes questionable.
 We have developed a novel approach to myocardial protection during cardiac operations based on these concepts, in which the chemically arrested heart is perfused continuously with blood and maintained at 37 degrees C.
 In 121 consecutive coronary bypass procedures we have compared this approach with a historical cohort of 133 consecutive patients treated with hypothermic cardioplegia.
 Perioperative myocardial infarction was significantly less prevalent (1.7% versus 6.8%; p less than 0.05) in the warm cardioplegic group, as was the use of the intraaortic balloon pump (0.9% versus 9.0%; p less than 0.005) and the prevalence of low output syndrome (13.5% versus 3.3%; p less than 0.005).
 Cardiac output immediately after bypass was significantly higher than before bypass (3.1 +/- 0.9 versus 4.9 +/- 1.0 L/min; p less than 0.001) only in the warm cardioplegia group.
 Furthermore, the heartbeat in 99.2% of patients treated with continuous warm cardioplegia converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously after removal of the aortic crossclamp compared with only 10.5% of the hypothermic group.
 The time from removal of the aortic crossclamp to discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass (i.e., reperfusion time) was significantly shorter in the warm cardioplegia group (11 +/- 4.3 versus 27 +/- 5.6 minutes; p less than 0.001).
 Our results suggest that continuous normothermic blood cardioplegia is safe and effective.
 Conceptually, this represents a new approach to the problem of maintaining excellent myocardial preservation during cardiac operations.

 The pathologically dilated vessels in the middle and deep dermis were found to have defective innervation with only single or no nerve fibers in their vicinity, while other structures in the skin showed a normal density of fibers.
 NSE- and PGP-like immunoreactive (-LI) nerve fibers were observed innervating vessels with a normal morphology and other structures in the skin, such as sweat glands and hair follicles, as free nerve endings and in nerve bundles.
 The nerve bundles were often seen to pass the ectatic vessels without giving off any branches.
 CGRP-LI nerve fibers were detected running toward epidermis, whereas no fibers were found around the ectatic vessels.
 NF-LI fibers were seen innervating normal vessels in dermis, while in relation to the dilated vessels, no or only occasional fibers were observed.
 The lack of innervation may be of importance for the development of the disease as a result of decreased tonus of the vessels and/or a loss of neuronal trophic factors.

 Those movements that occurred during sleep without awakenings were usually preceded by arousal phenomena and, rarely, by sleep spindles or slow waves.
 The control group showed normal ""semipurposeful"" movements under the same conditions during sleep.
 The rare appearance of the different dyskinesias and normal movements under similar circumstances during sleep could be a result of common effects on the generator systems or changes in the excitability of the final common motor pathway.

454,"Recreational sun exposure in Puerto Rico: trends and cancer risk awareness.
 Persons who sunbathe or engage in other activities at the beach are exposed to large amounts of UV radiation.
 Four hundred seven adults who visited the beaches of Puerto Rico were surveyed to determine their knowledge about the risks of sun exposure and to evaluate sunscreen use.
 The group consisted of 195 year-round Puerto Rican residents and 212 tourists.
 Ninety-five percent believed that the sun can cause skin cancer, although only half of the subset who lived all year in Puerto Rico believed that they personally received enough exposure to be at risk.
 The majority of the group (83%) understood the meaning of the sun protection factor numbers, although 35% used either nothing or a nonscreening oil.
 Half of Puerto Rican residents rarely or never used sunscreen protection while sunbathing.
 When sunscreen was used, the most important factor sought was given as sun protection factor (64%), followed by a perceived ability to aid in tanning (26%).

455,"Cutaneous angiolipoleiomyoma.
 We describe eight cases of cutaneous angiolipoleiomyoma, a rare tumor previously reported only once under the term cutaneous angiomyolipoma.
 Clinically, the tumors were acquired, solitary, asymptomatic nodules that were always acral in location.
 Patients' ages ranged from 33 to 77 years (median 52.6 years); the male/female ratio was 7:1.
 Signs of tuberous sclerosis or renal angiomyolipoma were absent in all cases.
 Histologically, the tumors were subcutaneous, well circumscribed, and composed of smooth muscle, vascular spaces, connective tissue, and mature fat.
 In some tumors the fat was the predominant component, and in others smooth muscle predominated.
 Elastic tissue stains revealed that some blood vessels had developed an elastic lamina whereas other blood vessels lacked it.
 Additional histologic features occasionally observed included vascular thrombi, glomus bodies, and focal mucin deposition.

457,"X-ray fluorescence measurements of lead burden in subjects with low-level community lead exposure.
 A k-x-ray fluorescence (K-XRF) instrument that can measure in vivo bone lead at low levels was used on a population of 34 adults with no known history of excessive lead exposure.
 A questionnaire that gathered information relevant to occupational and environmental lead exposure was administered prior to the measurement.
 A 30-min measurement that produced an average estimated uncertainty of 6 mcg lead/g bone mineral was taken at the mid-tibial diaphysis for each subject.
 Eighteen subjects had bone lead levels below the measurement uncertainty.
 The remainder had bone lead levels ranging up to 21 mcg lead/g bone mineral.
 Bone lead levels were greater among older subjects.
 Among young adult subjects, bone lead levels greater than the measurement uncertainty were confined entirely to subjects who had grown up in housing that was estimated to have been build prior to 1955.
 Such a childhood environment is at high risk of fostering exposure to biologically absorbable lead through ingestion of lead paint-contaminated dust and lead pipe-contaminated water.
 We conclude that the K-XRF technique has the potential to distinguish between low levels of lead burden in epidemiologic studies.

458,"Ten-year incidence of myocardial infarction and prognosis after infarction. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study of Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery 
 BACKGROUND.
 The 10-year incidence of myocardial infarction (fatal and nonfatal) and the prognosis after infarction were evaluated in 686 patients with stable angina who were randomly assigned to medical or surgical treatment in the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study of Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Myocardial infarction was defined by either new Q wave findings or clinical symptoms compatible with myocardial infarction accompanied by serum enzyme elevations with or without electrocardiographic findings.
 Treatment comparisons were made according to original treatment assignment; 35% of the medical cohort had bypass surgery during the 10-year follow-up period.
 The overall cumulative infarction rate was somewhat higher in patients assigned to surgery (36%) than in medical patients (31%) (p = 0.13) due to perioperative infarctions (13%) and an accelerated infarction rate after the fifth year of follow-up (average, 2.4%/yr in the surgical group versus 1.4%/yr in the medical group).
 The 10-year cumulative incidence of death or myocardial infarction was also higher in surgical (54%) than in medical (49%) patients (p = 0.20).
 According to the Cox model, the estimated risk of death after infarction was 59% lower in surgical than in medical patients (p less than 0.0001).
 The reduction in postinfarction mortality with surgery was most striking in the first month after the event: 99% in the first month (p less than 0.0001) and 49% subsequently (p less than 0.0001).
 The estimated risk of death in the absence of infarction was nearly identical regardless of treatment (p = 0.75).
 Exclusion of perioperative infarctions did not alter the findings.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Although surgery does not reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction overall, it does reduce the risk of mortality after infarction, particularly in the first 30 days after the event (fatal infarctions).

459,"Results of operative treatment for intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus.
 Since 1980 our treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures consists of open reduction with distractor, bone grafting, and internal fixation.
 Thereby no splints are applied and early postoperative movement is possible.
 For precise preoperative planning a CT scan is required.
 Proper timing and careful preoperative planning are essential to prevent soft-tissue complications.
 In a total of 16 fractures good clinical and radiologic results were achieved in 50% of the cases; results were satisfactory in 25% and poor in 25%.
 The patients returned to work after an average of 5 months.
 Only three patients (19%) received disability compensations, which compares favorably with nonoperative treatment.
 We believe that a majority of comminuted intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus profit from open reduction and internal fixation and that more reliable functional results are achieved than with conservative therapy.

 A method for arterial tree mapping that can be used in cadaver soft tissue is presented.
 In situ angiograms and photographs are supplemented with profile angiograms of relatively narrow bands of tissue from the removed specimen.
 The described method was better suited for mapping the course and supply patterns of a soft-tissue arterial network than either in situ angiograms or dissection.
 While practical problems were encountered with most of the solutions used for providing radiopacity or structural support to the vessels, pure barium sulfate was found to be suitable because it filled the vascular tree to the capillary level without leakage during excision of the specimen.

461,"Myocardial protein turnover in patients with coronary artery disease. Effect of branched chain amino acid infusion.
 The regulation of protein metabolism in the human heart has not previously been studied.
 In 10 postabsorptive patients with coronary artery disease, heart protein synthesis and degradation were estimated simultaneously from the extraction of intravenously infused L-[ring-2,6-3H]phenylalanine (PHE) and the dilution of its specific activity across the heart at isotopic steady state.
 We subsequently examined the effect of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) infusion on heart protein turnover and on the myocardial balance of amino acids and branched chain ketoacids (BCKA) in these patients.
 In the postabsorptive state, there was a net release of phenylalanine (arterial-cardiac venous [PHE] = -1.71 +/- 0.32 nmol/ml, P less than 0.001; balance = -116 +/- 21 nmol PHE/min, P less than 0.001), reflecting protein degradation (142 +/- 40 nmol PHE/min) in excess of synthesis (24 +/- 42 nmol PHE/min) and net myocardial protein catabolism.
 During BCAA infusion, protein synthesis increased to equal the degradation rate (106 +/- 24 and 106 +/- 28 nmol PHE/min, respectively) and the phenylalanine balance shifted (P = 0.01) from negative to neutral (arterial-cardiac venous [PHE] = 0.07 +/- 0.36 nmol/ml; balance = 2 +/- 25 nmol PHE/min).
 BCAA infusion stimulated the myocardial uptake of both BCAA (P less than 0.005) and their ketoacid conjugates (P less than 0.001) in proportion to their circulating concentrations.
 Net uptake of the BCAA greatly exceeded that of other essential amino acids suggesting a role for BCAA and BCKA as metabolic fuels.
 Plasma insulin levels, cardiac double product, coronary blood flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption were unchanged.
 These results demonstrate that the myocardium of postabsorptive humans is in negative protein balance and indicate a primary anabolic effect of BCAA on the human heart.

463,"The expression of progesterone receptors coincides with an arrest of DNA synthesis in human breast cancer.
 Two main models to account for the heterogeneous expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in human breast cancer have been proposed: the clonal model and the stem cell model.
 The authors previously provided evidence supporting the stem cell model since it was found that most of the proliferating cells in ER-positive (ER+) human breast cancer lack ER and that the ER-negative (ER-) and ER+ subpopulations are interrelated.
 The authors have analyzed in eighteen ER+/PR+ primary breast tumors the simultaneous expression of ER or PR (by immunohistochemistry) and DNA synthesis (by autoradiography) after 30 minutes of 3H-thymidine incorporation.
 The authors demonstrated that: (1) the average numbers of ER+ and PR+ cells were similar (36.8 +/- 10.7% and 39.3 +/- 17.6%, respectively); (2) The thymidine-labeling indexes of the ER+, ER-, PR+, and PR- subpopulations were 0.53 +/- 0.69%, 0.74 +/- 0.49%, 0.21 +/- 0.21 and 0.94 +/- 0.54%, respectively; and (3) 75.2% of the DNA-synthesizing cells were ER-, and 88.8% of them were PR-.
 The authors conclude that the cellular subpopulations expressing ER and PR were not identical, and the expression of PR was associated with a lower rate of cellular proliferation than was ER expression.

464,"Effects of carotid denervation and decerebration on ventilatory response to CO.
 To clarify the mechanisms involved in the ventilatory response to the inhalation of low concentrations of CO (0.18-0.22% in air), the roles of the arterial chemoreceptors and the forebrain structures have been investigated in unanesthetized adult cats.
 The ventilatory response was observed in conscious animals intact, after carotid denervation (CD), and after midcollicular decerebration.
 The results show that the initial small ventilatory depression was unaffected by CD but that the subsequent characteristic tachypnea was blunted after CD even after more prolonged exposure to CO.
 The CO tachypnea was not observed after decerebration, but a residual hyperventilation was noted with the higher concentration used.
 It may be concluded that carotid chemoreceptors do not mediate the CO tachypnea, which may then originate in suprapontine structures as shown by comparison of intact and decerebrate animals.
 The blunting of the tachypnea after CD may be caused by the relative hypercapnia observed in CD animals.
 The residual hyperventilation observed in decerebrate animals may be caused by central acidosis and/or some peripheral potentiation of chemoreceptor activity resulting from the decrease in arterial blood pressure that accompanied CO inhalation in decerebrate animals.

465,"Doxazosin and atenolol as monotherapy in mild and moderate hypertension: a randomized, parallel study with a three-year follow-up.
 The efficacy and safety of doxazosin (n = 83) and atenolol (n = 81) have been compared during a 3-year period.
 Doxazosin (mean dose at 3 years, 5.2 mg/day) and atenolol (mean dose, 66.4 mg/day) produced a sustained and overall similar reduction in blood pressure, with no evidence of tolerance.
 Doxazosin decreased mean blood pressure from 158/104 mm Hg to 146/90 mm Hg; with atenolol the decrease was from 160/103 mm Hg to 144/88 mm Hg.
 Whereas the reduction in blood pressure with atenolol was paralleled by a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in heart rate (from a mean of 74 to 60 beats/min), doxazosin produced no clinically meaningful changes in heart rate.
 In contrast to atenolol, doxazosin reduced triglyceride levels by -5.9% (atenolol +22.5%), increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by +3.7% (atenolol, -11.2%), and increased the high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio by +5.9% (atenolol, -10.3%); all of these values were significantly (p less than 0.001) different from those of atenolol-treated patients.
 Doxazosin also reduced the calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by -3.3% (atenolol, unchanged).
 The adverse effect of atenolol on lipid levels apparently negated any beneficial effect of blood pressure reduction, because the calculated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk actually increased significantly.
 In contrast, the reduction in calculated CHD risk in the doxazosin group was statistically significant at all points during the study.
 The safety profile of the drugs was similar.
 With the added potential of the reduction in the calculated risk of CHD among hypertensive patients,doxazosin represents an appropriate first-line drug for the treatment of essential hypertension.

 We tested the hypothesis that intracellular Ca++ [( Ca++]i) overload underlies the diastolic dysfunction of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
 Myocardial tissue was obtained at the time of surgery or transplantation from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and was compared with control myocardium obtained from patients without heart disease.
 The isometric contractions and electrophysiologic properties of all myocardial specimens were recorded by standard techniques and [Ca++]i was measured with the bioluminescent calcium indicator aequorin.
 In contrast to the controls, action potentials, Ca++ transients, and isometric contraction and relaxation were markedly prolonged in the hypertrophic myocardium, and the Ca++ transients consisted of two distinct components.
 At 38 degrees C and 1 Hz pacing frequency, a state of relative Ca++ overload appeared develop, which produced a rise in end-diastolic [Ca++]i, incomplete relaxation, and fusion of twitches with a resultant decrease in active tension development.
 We also found that drugs with increase [Ca++]i, such as digitalis, exacerbated these abnormalities, whereas drugs that lower [Ca++]i, such as verapamil, or agents that increase cyclic AMP, such as forskolin, prevented them.
 These results may explain why patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy tolerate tachycardia poorly, and may have important implications with regard to the pharmacologic treatment of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

468,"Successful treatment of severe premenstrual syndrome by combined use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and estrogen/progestin 
 Although abolishment of ovarian cyclicity by the use of a long-acting GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) provides effective treatment for premenstrual syndrome (PMS), its use is limited by sequellae of the resultant hypoestrogenism.
 In this study the effects of estrogen/progestin replacement on the symptomatic improvement afforded by GnRH-a were evaluated in eight women with severe PMS.
 The 8-month study design included 2 months of control, 2 months of GnRH-a alone, and 4 further months in which the exogenous steroids were replaced in randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over fashion using 1 month each of 1) conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) on days 1-25, 2) 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on days 16-25, 3) CEE (days 1-25) plus MPA (days 16-25), and 4) placebo alone.
 Mood and physical symptoms were measured daily on a valid and reliable instrument, the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences.
 As expected, administration of GnRH-a alone resulted in a 75% improvement in luteal phase symptom scores (17.8 +/- 4.8 vs.
 4.2 +/- 1.6; P less than 0.01).
 Combined sequential administration of CEE and MPA in addition to GnRH-a was effective in maintaining the reduced symptom scores seen after GnRH-a alone and was superior to the addition of CEE alone, MPA alone, or placebo.
 This combination of CEE and MPA resulted in a 60% improvement (P less than 0.05) compared to the luteal phase of control months in both behavioral (14.1 +/- 3.9 vs.
 4.2 +/- 0.8) and total (17.8 +/- 4.8 vs.
 6.5 +/- 1.8) symptoms.
 We conclude that the undesirable consequence of ovarian steroid deficiency in the treatment of PMS by GnRH-a can be overcome by the addition of sequential estrogen and progestogen replacements without significantly reducing the effectiveness of GnRH-a in this disorder.

 This study explores the relationship between the use of medical services by hypertensive patients and mechanisms for payment within a single primary care practice.
 Three payment mechanisms were explored: public assistance, a capitated health maintenance organization (HMO), and fee-for-service.
 Patterns were examined across reimbursement type for the following variables: age, sex, visit reason, number of visits, medications, tests ordered, referrals made, and recommendations for follow-up visits.
 Illness severity was controlled in two ways: (1) by the study being focused on one diagnosis--mild to moderate hypertension, and (2) by concurrent chronic illnesses being enumerated and included in the analysis.
 Medical visits to the physician were examined over a 2-year period for 25 to 30 patients randomly sampled from each of the three payment mechanisms.
 Statistically significant differences were found for patient behaviors (total number of patient visits) and physician behaviors (number of medications and recommendations for revisits).
 The highest visit frequency was found for those on public assistance, followed closely by those covered by an HMO, and more distantly by those choosing fee-for-service.

 SETTINGS--Cardiology outpatient department, Sassoon General Hospitals, Pune, India.
 PATIENTS--37 Adults with mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure less than 110 mm Hg).
 INTERVENTION--Patients received either placebo or potassium 60 mmol/day alone or in combination with magnesium 20 mmol/day in a crossover design.
 No other drug treatment was allowed.
 MEASUREMENTS--Blood pressure and heart rate assessed at weekly intervals and biochemical parameters at monthly intervals.
 RESULTS--Potassium alone or in combination with magnesium produced a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p less than 0.001) and a significant reduction in serum cholesterol concentration (p less than 0.05); other biochemical variables did not change.
 Magnesium did not have an additional effect.

 Because antegrade cardioplegia may limit the distribution of cardioplegia beyond a coronary occlusion, this study was undertaken to determine whether retrograde coronary sinus cardioplegia provides superior myocardial protection during revascularization of an acute coronary occlusion.
 In 20 adult pigs, the second and third diagonal branches were occluded with a snare for 1 1/2 hours.
 Animals were then placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and underwent 30 minutes of ischemic arrest with multidose, potassium, crystalloid cardioplegia.
 In 10 animals, the cardioplegia was given antegrade through the aortic root, whereas in 10 others, it was given retrograde through the coronary sinus.
 After the arrest period, the coronary snares were released and all hearts were reperfused for 3 hours.
 Postischemic damage in the myocardium beyond the occlusions was assessed by wall motion scores using two-dimensional echocardiography (4 = normal to -1 = dyskinesia), the change in myocardial pH from preischemia, and the area of necrosis/area of risk (histochemical staining).
 Hearts protected with retrograde coronary sinus cardioplegia had less tissue acidosis (change in pH = 0.08 +/- 0.03 versus 0.41 +/- 0.13; p less than 0.05), higher wall motion scores (2.0 +/- 0.6 versus 1.3 +/- 0.3; not significant), and less myocardial necrosis (43.4% +/- 3.6% versus 73.3% +/- 3.5%; p less than 0.0001).

 The trial involved surgical resection and/or decompression followed by intracavitary implantation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and autologous stimulated lymphocytes (ASL) along with rIL-2 in a plasma clot.
 One month later, stimulated lymphocytes and rIL-2 were infused through a Rickham reservoir attached to a catheter directed into the tumor bed.
 The LAK cells were rIL-2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 4 days; the ASL were lectin- and rIL-2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 10 days.

 Models studied included two-kidney, one-clip hypertension, one-kidney, one-clip hypertension, desoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension, and three normotensive control groups: two-kidney control, one-kidney control and salt-loaded control.
 Blood pressures at death were significantly higher in all three hypertensive groups compared with normotensive controls, but there were no significant differences among the hypertensive or normotensive groups.
 Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly elevated in all three hypertensive groups compared with respective controls, with no significant differences among hypertensive or control groups.
 In all three hypertensive groups, there were significant reductions in binding of aortic and mesenteric vascular alpha-1 receptors, renal tubular alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors, and adrenal cortical alpha-2 receptors when compared with respective control groups.
 Reduced binding of cardiac ventricular alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors was also found in all hypertensive groups, but not to statistically significant levels.
 No significant differences in intestinal alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptor binding were detected in either hypertensive or normotensive groups.
 The results suggest increased peripheral sympathetic activity in all three models of experimental hypertension, which is associated with down-regulation of alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors in a number of peripheral tissues, especially those that control cardiovascular hemodynamics and fluid and salt balance.
 There is no evidence of an increase in peripheral alpha receptor binding as has often been found in some models of genetic or spontaneous hypertension.

 Compared to normal brain, the spectra from low-grade astrocytomas showed a significant reduction of the phosphodiester (PDE) peak.
 Glioblastomas were characterized by a significant reduction of the PDE peak, elevation of the phosphomonoester (PME) peak, and a relatively alkaline intracellular pH.
 The spectra from meningiomas and pituitary adenomas were markedly different from the glial tumors.
 Meningiomas showed significant reductions in phosphocreatine, PDE, and inorganic phosphate, as well as a relatively alkaline pH.
 Pituitary adenomas resembled meningiomas, but had a much higher PME peak.

 There is doubt about concentrations of circulating calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and the value of plasma CGRP measurements in the detection and follow-up of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).
 Thus, we developed an immunochemiluminometric sandwich assay for CGRP using antibodies purified from a polyclonal antiserum against human CGRP.

 Normal plasma CGRP values ranged from less than 0.4 to 4.5 pmol/L (median, 0.8; n = 31), with 61% having detectable levels.
 Values in samples from patients with MTC were elevated: unoperated patients (n = 10), 4.7-137 pmol/L (median, 7.1); and operated patients with gross persistent or recurrent tumor (n = 14), 4.7-171 pmol/L (median, 23.2).

 CGRP levels increased after pentagastrin injection in MTC patients, but less than did CT values.
 Cultured MTC cells in vitro secreted large amounts of CGRP, and rat nerve root ganglia, human osteoblasts, and microvessel endothelial cells secreted lesser amounts.
 We conclude that CGRP circulates in normal plasma, but at very low levels.
 Plasma CGRP concentrations are frequently high in patients with MTC, but primarily in those with gross tumor or metastases.
 Plasma CT assay is the preferable test for MTC, but CGRP assay deserves prospective study for a possible role in predicting gross metastasis.

479,"Characteristics of erythroleukemia cells selected for vincristine resistance that have accelerated inducer-mediated differentiation.
 The induction of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELC; DS19/Sc9) to terminal differentiation by hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA) is characterized by a latent period of 10-12 hr before onset of commitment to terminal-cell division and increased transcription of globin genes.
 MELC variants, derived from this parental cell line, selected for resistance to vincristine (VC), can be induced to differentiate with little or no latent period.
 This study shows that accelerated HMBA-induced commitment is characteristic of MELC with a low level (2- to 5-fold) of VC resistance in four independently derived cell lines.
 Both resistance to VC and accelerated differentiation are stable phenotypes for at least 50 passages (approximately 5 months) in the absence of VC.
 Low-level VC-resistant MELC do not display increased levels of P-glycoprotein or mdr1, mdr2, and mdr3 mRNAs, nor do they exhibit cross-resistance to colchicine or doxorubicin.
 These cells do show (i) increased level of protein kinase C activity, (ii) reduced accumulation of [3H]VC, and (iii) restoration of VC sensitivity in the presence of verapamil.
 MELC selected for higher levels of VC resistance (approximately 500-fold) do express high levels of P-glycoprotein and the mdr3 gene.
 During HMBA-induced differentiation, DS19/Sc9 decrease [3H]VC accumulation, but P-glycoprotein content does not change.
 A VC-transport-associated protein, also critical for the process of induced differentiation, may be constitutively present in VC-resistant MELC, accounting for their enhanced sensitivity to inducer.
 This protein accumulates by exposure of VC-sensitive cells to HMBA, contributing to their differentiation and decreased level of VC accumulation.

 The diagnosis and treatment of breast lesions may be markedly enhanced by the use of a unique new source of near-monochromatic x-rays.
 Concentric beams of near-monochromatic x-ray photons may be generated by collision of the free electron laser (FEL) electron beam with the optical beam in an interaction zone that delivers the x-rays to a shirtsleeve environment.
 The absence of Compton scatter and the photoelectric interaction within tissues improves conspicuity of lesions by two to six times.
 Increased attenuation of x-rays in malignant vs.
 normal tissues makes tumors more obvious.
 K-edge subtraction allows chemical analysis of tumors in vivo--all at radiation doses that are one-tenth to one-fiftieth that delivered by the lowest-dose mammographic x-ray technique available.
 This allows for an increased sensitivity and specificity and permits prediction of histology, negating necessity for biopsies.
 Selective bond-breaking at depth in tissues as well as x-ray-activated photodynamic therapy are also being explored.

482,"Secondary prevention with verapamil after myocardial infarction. The Danish Study Group on Verapamil in Myocardial Infarction.
 The effect of verapamil on death and major events (i.e., death or reinfarction) after an acute myocardial infarction was studied in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trial II (DAVIT II).
 Eight hundred seventy-eight patients started treatment with verapamil 360 mg/day and 897 patients with placebo.
 Treatment continued for up to 18 months (mean 16 months).
 Ninety-five deaths and 146 major events occurred in the verapamil group and 119 deaths and 180 major events in the placebo group.
 Eighteen-month mortality rates were 11.1 and 13.8% (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence limits 0.63 to 1.05, p = 0.108), and major event rates 18.0 and 21.6% (0.80, 0.64 to 0.99, p = 0.027) in the verapamil and placebo groups respectively.
 When combining the results of this trial with the results of the first Danish study on verapamil in myocardial infarction, the meta-analysis demonstrated that treatment with verapamil from the second week after an acute myocardial infarction resulted in a reduction of pooled odds ratios of 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.37, p = 0.04) for death, 0.21 (0.05 to 0.35, p = 0.02) for major events, and 0.27 (0.06 to 0.43, p = 0.02) for first reinfarctions.
 It is concluded that long-term treatment with verapamil after an acute myocardial infarction is associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality as well as major event and reinfarction rates.

484,"An immunohistochemical evaluation of progesterone receptor in frozen sections, paraffin sections, and cytologic imprints of breast carcinomas.
 Two monoclonal antibodies to progesterone receptor (PR), JZB39 and KD68, were used for the immunocytochemical visualization of PR in different kinds of breast cancer specimens including (1) cryostat sections of tumors frozen at -80 degrees C; (2) paraffin sections of tumors fixed in formalin or in Bouin's fixative for varying periods of time at room temperature or at 4 degrees C; and (3) imprints and cryostat sections prepared from the tissue used for frozen section diagnosis and stored at -80 degrees C after fixation in Zamboni's solution.
 Sections of conventionally frozen specimens as well as imprints and cryostat sections stored for varying periods of time were stained with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique, whereas the avidin-biotin technique was used for paraffin sections.
 In all types of specimens the PR immunostaining was localized to the nuclei of carcinoma cells and displayed considerable heterogeneity both in intensity and in distribution of positive cells.
 Close correspondence was found between the different immunohistochemical techniques as well as between immunostaining and steroid-binding assays.
 PR staining was more frequently positive in well-differentiated than in moderately or poorly differentiated carcinomas, whereas no meaningful correlation was found between PR staining and extent of the disease.
 Similar results were obtained with the immunostaining of estrogen receptor in the same material using monoclonal antibodies H222 and D75P3 gamma.
 Thus, by choosing the technique that best suits the type of specimen available, it is possible to obtain valid information on the receptor status of any breast carcinoma, regardless of its size and clinical presentation.

485,"Mandibular ramus anatomy as it relates to the medial osteotomy of the sagittal split ramus osteotomy.
 The sagittal split ramus osteotomy is probably the most frequently used procedure for correction of mandibular skeletal dentofacial deformities.
 Despite numerous improvements in the technique in the 30 years since the procedure was introduced, a number of troublesome complications still occur.
 These include unfavorable fracture during surgery, paresthesia, and relapse.
 The purpose of this study was to determine where fusion of the buccal and lingual cortical plates occurs in the upper mandibular ramus, as it is thought that placement of the horizontal medial osteotomy above the point of fusion (without any intervening medullary bone) may lead to unfavorable fracture during splitting.
 Forty-nine human mandibles were sectioned vertically at three locations perpendicular to the surface of the ramus and the occlusal plane.
 Measurements were made to locate vertically the point of fusion of the buccal and lingual cortical plates relative to the lingula and to the depth of the sigmoid notch.
 The point of fusion occurred between 7.5 and 13.3 mm above the lingula.
 Only 2% of mandibles had fusion at or below the level of the lingula in the anterior ramus, whereas in the posterior ramus, 6.1% of mandibles were fused at that level.
 At a level halfway from the lingula to the sigmoid notch, 20% of mandibles were fused in the anterior ramus, whereas in the mid- to posterior ramus, the incidence was as high as 39%.
 The location of the medial horizontal osteotomy should be at or just above the tip of the lingula.
 A higher level of cut may be associated with an increased difficulty in splitting or incidence of unfavorable fracture.

 Trauma remains the major cause of death in children and young adults.
 Adult and pediatric patients differ significantly in both mechanism of and physiologic response to injury.
 We reviewed the records of all consecutive adult and pediatric blunt trauma patients admitted to a major metropolitan trauma center for a 10-year period.
 An extensive computerized database has been maintained for all patients since 1977.
 A comparative statistical analysis of mechanism of injury, specific organ injury, and clinical outcome was performed.
 Altogether, 1,722 adults and 289 children were treated during the study period.
 Blunt trauma accounted for 82.8% of adult and 94.3% of pediatric injury (p = 0.00005), and only these patients were considered for analysis.
 Diagnostic peritoneal lavage was performed in 249 children and 1,464 adults, with a respective accuracy of 99.6% and 97.2%.
 Mechanism of injury was comparable for both groups, although children were far more likely to be injured by falls, bicycle accidents, or struck by an automobile.
 Comparative analysis of specific injuries demonstrated significantly fewer pediatric chest (p = 0.001), spine (p = 0.03), and pelvic (p = 0.003) injuries.
 Central nervous system (CNS) injury in children was a strong determinant of outcome: serious pediatric CNS trauma was associated with a tenfold increase in mortality.
 Mortality for children in the absence of CNS injury was less than 3%.
 Spinal injury also appeared to be a predictor of poor outcome in the pediatric population, with an associated mortality of greater than 50%.
 Overall, survival was age independent (82.5% of adults and 85.8% of children were survivors.

 Studies of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in the colon and rectum have been limited by the paucity of experimental models of adenoma growth and progression.
 Progress recently was reported in the development of monolayer culture systems.
 The principal objective of this study was to develop a primary culture system for colorectal adenomas that would simulate three-dimensional in vivo growth.
 We used a calcium alginate encapsulation technique that was previously described for established tumor cell lines.
 Briefly, fresh resected specimens were washed, minced into small multicellular particles called microadenomas, and encapsulated in 1% calcium alginate pellets.
 The pellets were maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 degrees C in humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2.
 Ten of eleven adenomas, including six tubular, three tubulovillous, and one villous have been successfully cultured for 34 to 162 days.
 Cell viability was confirmed histologically by light and electron microscopy.
 The cells were characterized as epithelial by morphologic features and ultrastructural studies, which showed a high degree of cellular differentiation, including villous brush borders and many desmosomes.
 Both tubular and villuslike structures have been observed in vitro, correlating in some cases with the histology of the parent adenoma.
 Measurements of proliferative activity by [3H]thymidine autoradiography or immunohistochemical staining with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 demonstrated growth fractions of 9% to 25%.
 A simple, highly efficient primary culture system was developed for the long-term maintenance of adenomas that promotes three-dimensional growth patterns and growth rates analogous to those seen in vivo.
 This model provides an opportunity to develop an experimental system for longitudinal studies of pathologic and molecular parameters in adenoma progression to carcinoma.

489,"Acute hemodynamic effects of captopril in children with a congestive or restrictive cardiomyopathy 
 The acute hemodynamic effects of captopril were evaluated at cardiac catheterization in 16 children (age, 0.3-18 years) with cardiomyopathy.
 Twelve children had congestive cardiomyopathy, whereas four had restrictive cardiomyopathy.
 Hemodynamic measurements were obtained 30 and 60 minutes after the oral administration of captopril (0.5 mg/kg).
 Blood pressures were measured in the aorta, pulmonary artery, right atrium, and pulmonary capillary wedge position; cardiac outputs were measured by the thermodilution technique.
 Hemodynamic data could not be obtained after the administration of captopril in one child with congestive cardiomyopathy because of an immediate, severe hypotensive response.
 In 11 of 12 children with congestive cardiomyopathy, cardiac index increased by 22%, from 2.3 to 2.8 l/min/m2 (p less than 0.05), and stroke volume increased by 22%, from 23 to 28 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05).
 Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 32 to 21 units.m2 (p less than 0.01), but the mean aortic pressure did not change significantly.
 In contrast, four children with restrictive cardiomyopathy had no change in cardiac output after captopril, but there was a trend toward significant arterial hypotension (mean aortic pressure decreased from 78 to 59 mm Hg).
 Thus, captopril acutely reduced systemic vascular resistance and increased both cardiac output and stroke volume in children with congestive cardiomyopathy.
 In children with restrictive cardiomyopathy, however, captopril did not affect cardiac output, but it did decrease aortic pressure.
 These data indicate that captopril may benefit children with a congestive cardiomyopathy but that captopril probably should not be used in children with restrictive disease.

490,"Factors determining improvement in left ventricular function after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction: primacy of baseline ejection fraction.
 Improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction is a measure of salvage of ischemic myocardium after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction.
 The degree of improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction may be influenced by many factors.
 Therefore, 137 patients in whom paired radionuclide angiograms were obtained within 24 h of acute infarction and before hospital discharge were retrospectively evaluated to determine which factors most affect improvement in ejection fraction.
 Only baseline ejection fraction correlated significantly with improvement in ejection fraction by both univariate analysis (ejection fraction as a continuous variable; p less than 0.001; ejection fraction as a categorical variable, less than or equal to 45% versus greater than 45%, p less than 0.0001) and multivariate analysis (p less than 0.0001).
 Reperfusion status (patent versus occluded infarct artery) and extent of coronary artery disease (one, two or three vessel) were significant factors by multivariate but not by univariate analysis.
 Location of infarction, treatment modality and time to treatment did not correlate with change in ejection fraction by either statistical technique.
 Thus, of those factors tested, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction is the most potent predictor of improvement in ventricular function after acute infarction.
 Knowledge of baseline ejection fraction may be helpful in deciding whether to treat some patients with equivocal indications or contraindications for reperfusion therapy.
 Clinical trials of reperfusion strategies should stratify patients on the basis of baseline ejection fraction if ejection fraction is to be used as an end point for myocardial salvage.

491,"The pharmacology of intravenous and oral etoposide.
 The epipodophyllotoxin derivative etoposide (VP-16) has been in widespread use both alone and in combination chemotherapy for the past decade.
 It has phase-specific cytotoxicity that acts in the last S and G2 phases of the cell cycle.
 Although its mode of action is not certain, it appears to act by causing breaks in DNA by interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or by the formation of free radicals.
 Most studies show biexponential decay after the intravenous (IV) administration of etoposide.
 Approximately 30% to 70% of administered etoposide is excreted, with approximately 45% present in the urine.
 Etoposide is available in oral and IV preparations.
 It is highly schedule-dependent, with once-daily doses (e.g., for 5 to 8 days every 21 days) giving results superior to intermittent administration.
 The bioavailability of oral etoposide is approximately 50%, but its absorption is not linear with increasing dose (e.g., greater than 200 mg/d, bioavailability decreases).
 Factors influencing the bioavailability of oral etoposide include patient status, concurrent medications, hepatic and renal function, and nausea and vomiting.
 In numerous clinical trials, etoposide has demonstrated excellent activity against a range of tumors, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC), malignant lymphomas, gestational trophoblastic tumors, Ewing's and soft tissue sarcomas, and germ cell tumors, with more modest activity in other tumors (e.g., non-SCLC).
 Although few comparative studies have been carried out, available data suggest that oral etoposide administered daily during 5 to 8 days is similar to the IV preparation in range of activity.
 In a study of 53 elderly patients with SCLC treated with etoposide (200 mg/d for five times), there was a response rate of 79% and a median survival of 9.5 months.
 These results were similar to those achieved with more intensive IV regimens.
 Several studies of chronic oral etoposide (50 mg/m2/d for 21 times) have been reported recently.
 Responses were observed in SCLC and germ cell tumors among patients who had relapsed after standard etoposide-containing regimens.
 These data suggest that etoposide may be a ""new"" drug when given in this schedule.
 The high response rates with oral etoposide suggest that oral administration may be substituted for IV administration.
 This substitution may allow for greater flexibility in chemotherapeutic administration, less hospitalization, and more acceptable toxicity.

 The population-based Augsburg Coronary Event Register (330,000 residents, age 25-74 years) has registered a total of 1012 cases of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 1985 and 1021 AMI in 1986 and categorized them on the basis of the current WHO diagnostic algorithm for AMI.
 The register is designed for longitudinal comparisons of annual AMI risk (incidence, attack rate, death rate), and the risk to the AMI patients themselves (28-day case fatality).
 The methodology and specific issues encountered during registration and data evaluation are described.
 With an estimated 95% completeness of case finding, the quality control data review which the register conducts annually shows a consistency of specific data structures which indicate stable case finding and validation procedures.
 However, local conditions which affect case finding and data completeness per case are responsible for the creation of subsets of AMI which are in turn distinguished by differences in diagnostic category structures.
 With regard to the study objectives, the differences among subsets appear to have the least effect on rate calculations if DEFINITE and POSSIBLE AMI are combined.
 The implications of methodological variations and subset differences within and across registers on annual rate calculations and result comparisons are discussed.

 To investigate factors contributing to reperfusion and reoxygenation myocardial injury, we exposed layers of cultured chick ventricular myocytes to severe hypoxia for up to 3 hours in the presence of 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose, zero glucose, and 5 mM pyruvate, and then exposed the myocytes to reoxygenation.
 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was moderately increased during 3 hours of hypoxia but was increased markedly during reoxygenation.
 Coincident changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and cell motion were also measured during hypoxia and reoxygenation.
 During hypoxia, [Ca2+]i increased to more than 1 microM, and with reoxygenation, [Ca2+]i abruptly decreased slightly but remained elevated more than 1 microM.
 Cells developed a stable rigor after 30 minutes of hypoxia.
 Reoxygenation caused a marked hypercontracture within 5 minutes.
 Pretreatment of myocytes with either 2,3-butanedione monoxime, which inhibits Ca2(+)-dependent force development, or cyanide inhibited reoxygenation hypercontracture.
 LDH release after reoxygenation was also significantly reduced in the presence of 2,3-butanedione monoxime.
 Treatment of myocytes with superoxide dismutase and catalase during hypoxia also resulted in a decrease in LDH release during reoxygenation.
 We conclude that an abrupt increase in [Ca2+]i during reoxygenation does not account for reoxygenation injury.
 However, in the presence of elevated [Ca2+]i, reoxygenation and the resulting probable resynthesis of ATP causes [Ca2+]i-dependent myofilament crossbridge cycling, and the resulting hypercontracture contributes to myocyte damage.
 The generation of oxygen free radicals after reoxygenation also appears to contribute to cell injury in this system.

 Atenolol alone was administered during weeks 1, 3, and 5.
 Naproxen or sulindac was administered with atenolol during week 2, with crossover during week 4.
 Data were analyzed for 27 of the patients (one dropped out after developing a skin rash).
 Naproxen significantly increased the systolic BP compared with placebo (mean 4.0 mm Hg; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1-7.0; p less than 0.05).
 There were no significant differences in systolic BP during sulindac administration compared with placebo or naproxen.
 No significant effects on diastolic BP were observed.
 Weight was increased by naproxen and sulindac compared with placebo (mean 0.6-0.8 kg, p less than 0.05), although not to a clinically significant extent.
 One-week therapy with naproxen has a greater potential than sulindac to increase systolic BP in well-controlled hypertensive patients receiving atenolol; however, the increase is minor and unlikely to be of clinical significance.

 Because concerns have been raised about high levels of psychopathology in military children, the authors used standardized psychopathology rating scales to survey 213 six-to twelve-year-old children of military parents and their parents.
 Results from children's symptom self-reports, as well as from teachers' ratings of children, indicated that children's symptom levels were at levels consistent with national norms.
 In contrast, parents' (especially mothers') ratings of children were significantly higher than national norms, as were parents' ratings of their own symptoms.
 Also, parents' own symptom reports showed somewhat stronger relationships with life stressors presumably affecting the child than did the children's and teachers' reports.
 Results suggest that parents' reports of children's symptoms may be mediated by the effects of military life stressors on the parents, but these stressors do not necessarily result in higher symptoms in the children.
 Overall results do not support the notion that levels of psychopathology are greatly increased in children of military parents.
 Further studies of military families should address the effects of rank and socioeconomic status, housing, and the current impact of life stressors on the parents as well as the children in order to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions about parts or all of the military community.

498,"Polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase during repair of duodenal mucosa after stress in rats.
 This investigation shows whether polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase have a role in duodenal mucosal repair following stress-induced microscopic damage.
 Rats were fasted for 22 hours, placed in restraint cages, and immersed in water to the xiphoid process for 6 hours.
 Animals were killed either immediately after the period of stress or at 2-hour intervals up to 24 hours thereafter.
 Duodenal mucosa was examined histologically, and ornithine decarboxylase and polyamine levels were measured.
 Ornithine decarboxylase activity was increased significantly up to 6 hours following stress, peaking at 4 hours at a level 10 times the prestress control.
 By 8 hours, enzyme activity had returned to near normal.
 Increases in mucosal putrescine, spermidine, and spermine content paralleled the changes in ornithine decarboxylase activity and peaked 4 hours after stress.
 Stress resulted in microscopic damage evidenced by a nearly complete absence of villi.
 Significant macroscopic lesions were not present following stress.
 Mucosal repair was evident 12 hours after stress and almost complete by 24 hours, although the restituted villi were short and blunted.
 The decreases in mucosal DNA, RNA, and protein content caused by stress were restored and reached near-normal levels 12 hours after the period of stress.
 In animals given the specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, increases in duodenal mucosal ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels were inhibited and mucosal repair was almost completely prevented following stress.
 alpha-Difluoromethylornithine also prevented the recovery of DNA, RNA, and protein content of the duodenal mucosa.
 These results indicate that duodenal mucosal damage following stress is repaired rapidly; the repair process is accompanied by significant increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels; and the increases in ornithine decarboxylase and polyamines are absolutely required for the normal repair of the mucosa.

 Vascular endothelial cells (EC) are the initial cells within the vascular wall exposed to decreases in blood ambient oxygen concentration.
 The mechanisms by which they tolerate low levels of oxygen are unknown, but may parallel the response to other cellular stresses, such as heat shock.
 After 4-8 h of hypoxia, we found a decrease in total protein synthesis in both cultured bovine aortic and pulmonary arterial EC.
 SDS-PAGE and autoradiographic analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins demonstrated the concomitant induction of a specific set of proteins (Mr 34, 36, 47, and 56 kD) in both cell types.
 These hypoxia-associated proteins (HAPs) were cell-associated and up-regulated in a time- and oxygen concentration-dependent manner.
 Comparison of these proteins with heat shock proteins (HSPs) demonstrated that HAPs were distinct from HSPs.
 EC maintained chronically in 3% O2 continued to synthesize elevated levels of HAPs, yet further up-regulated these proteins when exposed to 0% O2.
 The presence of five times the normal media glucose concentration did not alter the appearance of HAPs.
 Hypoxia sensitive renal tubular epithelial cells up-regulated no proteins corresponding to HAPs and were irreversibly damaged within 8 h of exposure to 0% O2.
 In vitro translation experiments demonstrated that the steady-state level of several mRNAs was higher in the anoxic EC than in normoxic EC and encoded for proteins of Mr 32, 35, 37, 40, and 48 kD that were different from proteins encoded by HSP mRNAs.

 Seventy patients with spontaneous and 21 with traumatic extracranial internal carotid artery dissections were studied clinically and angiographically with mean follow-ups of 64 (spontaneous group) and 40 months (traumatic group).
 Sixty percent of the patients in the spontaneous group and 71% in the traumatic group also had follow-up angiograms.
 In traumatic dissections aneurysms were common, significantly fewer aneurysms resolved or became smaller and fewer stenoses resolved or improved, whereas more stenoses progressed to occlusion.
 Traumatic dissections were more likely to leave the patients with neurological deficits.
 A significantly higher percentage of the patients with spontaneous dissections were asymptomatic at follow-up compared with the traumatic group.
 Although both spontaneous and traumatic dissections of extracranial internal carotid arteries mostly carry a good prognosis, the outcome may be somewhat less favorable for the traumatic group.

504,"Adequate resuscitation of burn patients may not be measured by urine output and vital signs.
 OBJECTIVE: To compare vital sign and urine output monitoring of seriously burned patients with invasive monitoring during early resuscitation.
 DESIGN: Retrospective review.
 SETTING: A university hospital burn unit.
 PATIENTS: Fourteen seriously burned patients who had pulmonary arterial monitoring.
 Monitoring data were compared at baseline and after fluid challenges.
 RESULTS: There was no correlation between invasively derived physiologic variables and vital signs and urine output.
 Vital signs and urine output changed little after fluid challenge, while variables from invasive monitoring demonstrated significant change.
 In half of the patients, oxygen consumption increased after fluid challenge; vital signs and urine output did not distinguish these patients.
 CONCLUSIONS: The use of urinary output and vital signs to guide initial burn resuscitation may lead to suboptimal resuscitation.
 Invasive cardiorespiratory monitoring may be necessary to optimize resuscitation of seriously burned patients.

 Extrahepatic lymph node metastases are not uncommon in advanced cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 This is the account of a HCC case in which intrahepatic lymphatics running toward the hepatic hilus were clearly opacified during hepatic arteriography.
 The patient was treated by hepatic artery embolization followed by selective embolization of the portal branches, but lymph node metastases at the hepatic hilus were later found during follow-up.
 The clinical course of this case suggests that the communication between the tumor and the lymphatics was responsible for the lymph node metastasis.

 Several studies have documented the common use of alcohol among medical students and the significant fraction of students (7% to 17%) who show a pattern of alcohol abuse.
 Many authors have pointed out the implications of physician impairment due to alcoholism, presently estimated at about 10%.
 We surveyed 263 junior and senior medical students, and our data support earlier surveys of the prevalence of alcohol abuse and indicate that students tend to drink less heavily and less frequently after entering medical school.
 The clinically proven CAGE questions used in the survey showed statistically significant associations between heavy or frequent drinking before and during medical school, but only 4.2% of respondents indicated that school officials had asked whether they had a drinking or drug abuse problem.
 Given these findings, we suggest the routine administration of screening instruments to medical students, using education and minimal intervention strategies with individuals at risk.

507,"The natural history of peripheral vascular disease. Implications for its management.
 The durability and the eventual complication rate of endovascular therapy (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, laser-assisted angioplasty, and atherectomy) are not yet entirely clear, especially with respect to the treatment of atherosclerotic lesions in the femoropopliteal or distal arterial segments.
 Therefore, the indications for its use have not been firmly established and must take into consideration the natural history of the occlusive disease itself.
 Although some type of procedural intervention clearly is warranted in the presence of ischemic rest pain or tissue necrosis, intermittent claudication is the only complaint in approximately 70% of patients who present with either aortoiliac or femoropopliteal involvement.
 Most nondiabetic patients experience substantial symptomatic improvement with a daily exercise program, and their long-term risks for either abrupt deterioration (20-25%) or amputation (less than 10%) are relatively low.
 In comparison, the 5-year mortality rate ranges from 20-40% even in claudicants, and as many as 40% of those with clinical indications of associated coronary artery disease have been shown angiographically to be candidates for myocardial revascularization.
 These observations suggest that traditional indications for surgical treatment (truly disabling claudication and/or limb salvage) also should be applied to endovascular therapy until its success is confirmed beyond speculation, and that incidental coronary disease deserves particular attention in patients with lower extremity ischemia.

 This Latin American study assessed in the general practice setting the efficacy and tolerance of once-daily doxazosin in the treatment of mild or moderate essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure, 95 to 115 mm Hg).
 Patients (n = 220) were treated with doxazosin for 12 weeks as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.
 At the final visit, doxazosin produced a mean change in sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure of -18.4/-14.4 mm Hg, at a mean daily dose of 4.3 mg.
 One hundred sixty-three (77.6%) of the 210 evaluable patients were considered a therapeutic success.
 Lipid analyses identified a statistically significant (p = 0.02) reduction in total serum cholesterol (4.85%) and an overall decrease in triglyceride levels (5.12%).
 According to the Framingham Heart Study equation, doxazosin produced a highly significant (p less than 0.001) 20% reduction in the calculated probability of developing coronary heart disease in 10 years.
 Of the 220 patients evaluated, 54 (24.5%) reported side effects that were considered related to treatment.
 Ten (4.5%) patients reported side effects unrelated to treatment and 37 (16.8%) reported events of unknown relationship.
 Most side effects were mild or moderate and were tolerated or disappeared with continued treatment.
 Nine patients (4.1%) were discontinued from therapy and in 13 (5.9%) the dose was reduced.
 The most prevalent side effects were headache and dizziness.

 Surgical thyroid sections from 30 papillary carcinomas (PC), six medullary carcinomas (MC), three anaplastic carcinomas (AC), two follicular carcinomas (FC), and 16 adenomas (AD) were examined with an indirect immunofluorescence technique employing different monoclonal antibodies to evaluate the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, B, C (Class I) and DR, DP, DQ (Class II) by thyrocytes, together with the phenotype and distribution of inflammatory cells.
 Ten PC and four FC were also investigated for the presence of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).
 In situ deposits of immunocomplexes and circulating thyroid autoantibodies were also evaluated.
 An increased expression of Class I antigens was found in all PC and FC, in 33% of MC and AC, and in 31% of AD.
 An anomalous expression of Class II antigens was observed in 70% of PC, in 50% of FC, in 33% of AC, in 19% of AD, and in none of the MC.
 Expression of DP or DQ was revealed only in a portion of the DR-positive glands.
 A reduction of microsomal autoantigen expression was found.
 No ICAM-1-positive thyrocytes were detected.
 A moderate T-lymphocytic infiltrate was noticed only in PC, where it was correlated with DR and DP and/or DQ coexpression.
 B-cells and natural killer cells were virtually absent.
 The authors speculate that the weak Class II antigens expression, together with the partial or complete loss in microsomal autoantigen and the absence of ICAM-1 by thyrocytes, may account for the limited engagement of immunocompetent cells observed in thyroid tumors.

511,"Treatment strategies in shock: use of oxygen transport measurements.
 Shock has traditionally been categorized according to its cause.
 Shock can result from hemorrhage, primary cardiac failure, central nervous system failure, trauma, or sepsis.
 Therapeutic principles have been developed for each etiologic type.
 End points for such therapy have included optimization of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac output, blood pressure, and urine output.
 Recent investigators agree that the common denominator in each of the shock syndromes is a reduction in the amount of oxygen consumed by the cell.
 The logical therapeutic approach would be to increase oxygen delivery to support the increased metabolic demand of the cells.
 The end point of resuscitation should be optimization of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption.
 These variables are easily calculated by using data obtained from pulmonary artery catheter and laboratory measurements.
 The physician or nurse caring for critical ill patients should have a thorough understanding of the rationale for the use of oxygen transport calculations and the methods of manipulating oxygen delivery.
 A simple explanation of these principles including the importance of hemoglobin, cardiac index, and percent saturation of hemoglobin and suggested treatment strategies are presented.

512,"A blinded comparison of noninvasive, in vivo phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the in vitro halothane/caffeine contracture test in the evaluation of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.
 Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal, anesthetic-induced syndrome.
 Currently, the only accurate means of diagnosing susceptibility to this syndrome is the testing of biopsied skeletal muscle for its contracture response to halothane and caffeine.
 A less invasive means of diagnosis is needed.
 The authors previously reported that MH-susceptible patients studied by in vivo phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy demonstrated a higher resting inorganic phosphate (Pi) to phosphocreatine (PCr) ratio in their skeletal muscle, as well as a slower postexercise recovery of PCr/Pi, when compared to normal controls.
 In the present blinded study, the authors compared in vivo 31P NMR determination of resting Pi/PCr and recovery rate of PCr/Pi in forearm muscles to in vitro halothane/caffeine contracture test results in 42 patients.
 Forty-three control subjects were studied to establish normal NMR values of resting Pi/PCr and recovery rate of PCr/Pi.
 Their findings were compared with those of 27 patients shown to be MH-susceptible and 15 patients MH-negative by contracture testing.
 The MH-susceptible group had a significantly (P less than 0.005) higher resting Pi/PCr value (0.202 +/- 0.044) than either the MH-negative (0.152 +/- 0.043) or the control (0.141 +/- 0.026) group.
 The MH-susceptible group also had a significantly (P less than 0.02) slower postexercise recovery rate of PCr/Pi (1.50 +/- 0.872 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) than either the MH-negative (2.11 +/- 1.07 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) or control (2.25 +/- 0.828 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) group.
 Twenty-six of the 27 MH-susceptible patients demonstrated abnormal NMR test results (a resting Pi/PCr greater than or equal to 0.18 or recovery rate less than 1.0 PCr.Pi-1.min-1), and 13 of the 15 MH-negative patients had normal NMR results.
 Although neither NMR parameter alone was diagnostically reliable, an NMR test utilizing both parameters was quite accurate.
 The NMR test and contracture test demonstrated an overall agreement of 93% with a copositivity of 96% and conegativity of 87%.
 The sensitivity and specificity of the NMR test is estimated to be 98.8% +/- 11.8% and 95.3% +/- 20.3%, respectively.
 The role of 31P NMR in the diagnosis of MH susceptibility and possible mechanisms underlying the observations are discussed.

 Two hundred and eighty subjects in three ambulatory care clinics participated in this study designed to assess the psychometric properties of the SMAST using DSM-III criteria for alcoholism as the diagnostic standard.
 Eighty-two subjects (30%) who completed the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule met DSM-III criteria for alcohol abuse and/or dependence.
 The sensitivity of the SMAST, using the generally accepted weighted cut-off score of five or greater, was .56 and the specificity was .83.
 An unweighted cut-off score of two or greater produced a sensitivity of .72 and a specificity of .64.

 The ability of abdominal ultrasound (US) to help localize gastrinomas was prospectively studied in 79 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
 The results were assessed by means of laparotomy, autopsy, or percutaneous liver biopsy.
 For hepatic gastrinoma, US had a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 100%, with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 89%.
 US was slightly less sensitive for detecting gastrinoma in the liver than were computed tomography (CT) (66%) and selective angiography (78%).
 For detection of extrahepatic gastrinoma, US had a sensitivity of 30%, a specificity of 94%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 25%.
 US enabled detection of tumor in eight cases not detected with CT and in four not detected with angiography.
 Specificity for extrahepatic gastrinoma was similar for all three modalities (89%-95%).
 CT and US were equally effective for the detection of extrahepatic gastrinoma, and angiography was significantly more effective than both US and CT (P less than .01).
 The authors conclude that US, although of low sensitivity, remains useful as the initial imaging modality in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

516,"Hirudin interruption of heparin-resistant arterial thrombus formation in baboons.
 To determine the role of thrombin in high blood flow, platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes we measured the relative antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects in baboons of hirudin, a highly potent and specific antithrombin, and compared the effects of heparin, an antithrombin III-dependent inhibitor of thrombin.
 Thrombus formation was determined in vivo using three relevant models (homologous endarterectomized aorta, collagen-coated tubing, and Dacron vascular graft) by measuring: (1) platelet deposition, using gamma camera imaging of 111In-platelets; (2) fibrin deposition, as assessed by the incorporation of circulating 125I-fibrinogen; and (3) occlusion.
 The continuous intravenous infusion of 1, 5, and 20 nmol/kg per minute of recombinant hirudin (desulfatohirudin) maintained constant plasma levels of 0.16 +/- 0.03, 0.79 +/- 0.44, and 3.3 +/- 0.77 mumol/mL, respectively.
 Hirudin interrupted platelet and fibrin deposition in a dose-dependent manner that was profound at the highest dose for all three thrombogenic surfaces and significant at the lowest dose for thrombus formation on endarterectomized aorta.
 Thrombotic occlusion was prevented by all doses studied.
 In contrast, heparin did not inhibit either platelet or fibrin deposition when administered at a dose that maximally prolonged clotting times (100 U/kg) (P greater than .1), and only intermediate effects were produced at 10-fold that dose (1,000 U/kg).
 Moreover, heparin did not prevent occlusion of the test segments.
 Hirudin inhibited platelet hemostatic function in concert with its antithrombotic effects (bleeding times were prolonged by the intermediate and higher doses).
 By comparison, intravenous heparin failed to affect the bleeding time at the 100 U/kg dose (P greater than .5), and only minimally prolonged the bleeding time at the 1,000 U/kg dose (P less than .05).
 We conclude that platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes are thrombin-mediated and that the biologic antithrombin hirudin produces a potent, dose-dependent inhibition of arterial thrombus formation that greatly exceeds the minimal antithrombotic effects produced by heparin.

517,"Tumor-secreted vascular permeability factor increases cytosolic Ca2+ and von Willebrand factor release in human endothelial cells.
 Vascular permeability factor (VPF), a tumor-secreted heparin-binding protein (Mr approximately 38,000), is responsible for increased vessel permeability and fluid accumulation associated with tumor growth.
 Vascular permeability factor also promotes the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) and bovine pulmonary ECs in vitro.
 It is shown for the first time that guinea pig VPF (half-maximal and maximal dose approximately 0.4 and 22 pmol/l (picomolar), respectively), as well as human VPF, are potent stimuli for human ECs resulting in [Ca2+]i increases (maximal three- to fourfold) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) formation.
 Unlike the maximal responses to thrombin and histamine, the [Ca2+]i response to a maximal VPF dose was preceded by a characteristic 10- to 15-second delay.
 Guinea pig VPF also selectively increased [Ca2+]i in cultured aortic and pulmonary artery ECs, but not aortic smooth muscle cells, human fibroblasts, or neutrophils.
 Affinity-purified rabbit antibody (raised to a synthetic peptide representing VPF N-terminal amino acids 1 to 24) adsorbed all vessel permeability-increasing activity, EC growth-promoting activity, and specifically all activity responsible for increasing EC [Ca2+]i.
 Similar to other mediators that increase [Ca2+]i in cultured ECs, VPF also induced a 200% increase in von Willebrand factor release.
 Together these data indicate that VPF acts directly on ECs and that rapid cellular events in its in vivo/in vitro actions are likely to involve phospholipase C activation, [Ca2+]i increase, and von Willebrand factor release.

 Two monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), BRIC 66 (IgM) and BRIC 111 (IgG1), were produced by immunizing mice with ovarian cyst blood group A1 glycoprotein and Tn red cells (RBCs), respectively.
 Their specificities were determined by inhibitions using Tn sialoglycoproteins (SGPs), mucins (armadillo [ASG] and ovine [OSG] submaxillary glycoproteins), and monosaccharides.
 BRIC 66 agglutinated both Tn and group A RBCs and reacted immunohistochemically with both the vascular endothelium and tumor cells from a group A adenocarcinoma, BRIC 66 was inhibited by N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), Tn SGPs, and mucins on both hemagglutination inhibition tests and radioimmunoassay.
 BRIC 111 agglutinated Tn RBCs only, and it specifically stained tumor cells from a group O patient's breast carcinoma and a group A patient's adenocarcinoma.
 In hemagglutination inhibition tests, BRIC 111 was readily inhibited by Tn SGPs, only partially inhibited by GalNAc, and not inhibited by mucins.
 In a sensitive radioimmunoassay, BRIC 111 was inhibitable by GalNAc.
 Tn SGP was 2000-fold more effective as an inhibitor than the mucins (ASG and desialized OSG), which contain a high content of terminal alpha-GalNAc-O-serine (threonine) residues.
 It is postulated that BRIC 66 is specific for terminal alpha-GalNAc units in carbohydrate chains.
 The exclusive reaction of BRIC 111 with Tn SGP indicates a combining site larger than GalNAc alpha-1, which probably includes amino acid residues in juxtaposition to GalNAc in Tn SGP.
 In view of its specific agglutination of Tn RBCs, BRIC 111 is a useful reagent for the examination of polyagglutinable RBCs.

 To investigate alterations in the basement membrane (BM) in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we investigated 20 tumors.

 Tumors were studied immunohistochemically by double immunofluorescent staining by using mouse monoclonal antibodies to the core protein of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and chondroitin 6-sulfate glycosaminoglycan (Ch6S) as well as rabbit antiserum to laminin (LN) and type IV collagen (C-4).
 In well-differentiated and highly keratinized SCC-NB, LN, C-4, and HSPG could be detected in the tumor nest BM and showed no loss of continuity, but they were largely lost in poorly differentiated and poorly keratinized SCC-NB.
 This suggests that poorly differentiated SCC-NB cause greater enzymatic degradation of BM components than well-differentiated SCC-NB.
 Ch6S was detected in parts of the BM of SCC-BD, but it was absent in all SCC-NB examined.
 It appears that SCC-NB have lost the ability to synthesize Ch6S, and that SCC-BD degrade Ch6S although they continue to produce it.
 Thus, it appears that in SCC the BM is qualitatively different from that of normal epidermis, and that SCC-BD can be distinguished from SCC-NB by the Ch6S content of the BM.

 Similarly, significantly elevated values for haematocrit, plasma and whole blood viscosity, as well as aggregation tendency were observed compared to controls.
 Although differing in these respects from controls, there were no obvious relationships between these rheological variables and either systolic or diastolic blood pressure.
 The significantly lower erythrocyte fluidity and other changes in haemorheological variables of red blood cells found in hypertensive patients may be explained by an enlarged metabolic pool of free calcium ions in these red blood cells.
 It is suggested that the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of essential hypertension are multifactorial rather than being based on a single molecular derangement.
 Primary events resulting in altered physicochemical properties of the red blood cells may work in concert in the development of essential hypertension, in addition to the increased availability of calcium ions and their potential role in smooth muscle contraction.

530,"The effects of etomidate on cerebral metabolism and blood flow in a canine model for hypoperfusion.
 The effects of etomidate, a nonbarbiturate cerebral metabolic depressant, on cerebral metabolism and blood flow were studied in 29 dogs during cerebral hypoperfusion.
 Three groups of animals were studied during a 45-minute normotensive and a 30-minute hypotensive period: 10 control animals without etomidate, 11 animals receiving a 0.1-mg/kg etomidate bolus followed by an infusion of 0.05 mg/kg/min etomidate (low-dose group), and eight animals receiving doses of etomidate sufficient to suppress electroencephalographic bursts (high-dose group).
 The mean arterial pressure fell to similar levels (p less than 0.05) during hypotension in all three groups (40 +/- 5, 38 +/- 3, and 27 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively).
 The mean cerebral oxygen extraction fraction rose (p less than 0.05) from 0.23 +/- 0.02 to 0.55 +/- 0.08 in the five control animals tested and from 0.33 +/- 0.02 to 0.53 +/- 0.02 in the seven animals tested in the low-dose group, but did not increase (p greater than 0.05) in the four animals tested in the high-dose group (0.24 +/- 0.03 to 0.23 +/- 0.05).
 Mean cerebral blood flow levels decreased in all groups during hypotension (p less than 0.05): 42 +/- 3 to 21 +/- 4 ml/100 gm/min (52% +/- 12% decrease) in the five animals tested in the control group, 60 +/- 8 to 24 +/- 6 ml/100 gm/min (56% +/- 13% decrease) in the four animals tested in the low-dose group, and 55 +/- 8 to 22 +/- 3 ml/100 gm/min (60% +/- 4% decrease) in the four animals tested in the high-dose group.
 In summary, the cerebral oxygen extraction fraction increased in the control animals and low-dose recipients during hypotension, suggesting the presence of threatened cerebral tissue.
 In contrast, the cerebral oxygen extraction did not change during hypotension when high-dose etomidate was administered.
 It is concluded that high-dose etomidate may preserve the cerebral metabolic state during hypotension in the present model.

531,"Proliferation markers Ki-67 and p105 in soft-tissue lesions. Correlation with DNA flow cytometric characteristics.
 Frozen tissue immunoreactivity with Ki-67, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a nuclear antigen in nonresting or proliferating cells, was compared to DNA flow cytometry results (from fresh tissue) in a diverse group of 60 soft-tissue lesions.
 Both DNA index and Ki-67 score were independently reported to be associated with grade and prognosis in sarcomas, but no direct comparison of these two variables was made.
 It was attempted to measure proliferative activity in fixed paraffin-embedded tissues immunohistochemically in a subset of lesions using an antibody to another nuclear proliferation antigen, p105.
 Lesions were given a grade according to lesion category (reactive, 1; benign, 2; low-grade malignant, 3; and high-grade malignant, 4).
 Ki-67 reactivity correlated relatively well with this grading system (r = 0.59); benign lesions usually exhibited a low Ki-67 score and malignant lesions usually but not always exhibited a high score.
 For example, some malignant fibrous histiocytomas contained only rare positive cells.
 Some disparity between Ki-67 score and grade and within histologic types indicates some independence from these features, a fact that may be important when correlation with prognosis is performed.
 However Ki-67 did not correlate well with flow data such as percentage S phase (r = 0.30), percentage S + G2M phases (r = 0.37), or DNA index (r = 0.39).
 This probably is due to the fact that Ki-67 also marks cells in the G1 phase, whereas these are excluded in flow data analyses.
 Anti-p105 highlighted almost all nuclei in all cases tested, including fibromatosis, and did not correlate with Ki-67 score, histologic grade or DNA flow cytometric data.
 Results with p105 could not be favorably affected by titration experiments.
 It is reasonable to conclude that the Ki-67 score is a variable related to but independent of histologic grade, histologic type, and DNA flow values.
 Whether it is prognostically important in human sarcomas, as has been suggested, awaits further clinicopathologic study.

 Blood lipids, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), smoking, dietary and exercise habits were studied in 911 wives of men with high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD).
 Following the 1979/80 Tromso Survey, 1373 men, aged 30-54 years, were identified as having high risk for CHD (HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol less than or equal to 17.6% and/or total cholesterol greater than or equal to 7.86 mmol l-1).
 Of the 1373 men, 911 individuals had wives who also attended the screening.
 These wives were compared to age-matched, married women in the general population.
 A significantly higher total cholesterol level (5.98 mmol l-1 vs.
 5.78 mmol l-1), lower HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol (30.01% vs.
 31.58%), higher BMI and higher coronary risk score (4.55 vs.

 They also had more dietary habits associated with increased risk of CHD than other married women in the general population.
 Our findings support the hypothesis that members of the same household as a person with increased risk for CHD also have increased risk.
 This is most probably due to shared lifestyle.

 Thirty-eight patients (30 men and 8 women) were treated once a week for 4 weeks every 5 weeks with doses of flavone acetic acid ranging from 0.33 to 12.5 g/m2.
 At doses less than or equal to 3.9 g/m2, the drug was administered intravenously over 1 hour; at doses greater than or equal to 5.28 g/m2, the infusion period was lengthened to 6 hours.
 Treatment of all patients included hydration before and after treatment and alkalization to maintain urine pH at greater than or equal to 6.5.
 A dose-limiting toxic effect was hypotension at 10 g/m2.
 Pharmacokinetic studies revealed linear behavior in the eight patients studied, beginning at 3.9 g/m2.
 Peak plasma levels ranged from 125 to 630 micrograms/mL, with a mean terminal half-life of 22.4 hours.
 Immunologic monitoring was performed in three patients at 10 g/m2.
 A transient increase in CD16- and/or Leu-19-positive cells was noted in all three patients.
 In one patient, this increase correlated with a 10-fold increase in K562 cell killing.
 There were no objective tumor responses seen in this trial.

535,"Avoiding interpretive pitfalls when assessing arrhythmia suppression after myocardial infarction: insights from the long-term observations of the placebo-treated patients in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS) 
 The Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS) was a 1 year trial that analyzed the safety and effectiveness of arrhythmia suppression in 502 patients surviving acute myocardial infarction who had greater than or equal to 10 ventricular premature depolarizations/h or greater than or equal to 5 runs of ventricular tachycardia on a Holter recording obtained 6 to 60 days after the acute infarction.
 Because 100 of these patients received placebo in a double-blind fashion for 1 year, a comprehensive objective analysis was performed of spontaneous arrhythmia changes based on real data rather than statistical estimates.
 In the CAPS placebo group, 19% developed some serious clinical event in 1 year (death, heart failure, proarrhythmia) that could likely be attributable to antiarrhythmic drug toxicity.
 A significant reduction in the frequency of ventricular premature depolarizations (p = 0.004) occurred in the first few weeks of ""therapy"" with a further significant (p less than 0.04) decrease between 3 to 12 months.

 Based on a prospective study on 342 sciatica patients examined with rhizography, the aim was to determine which factors others than the rhizography finding and the grade and duration of symptoms were related to the selection of patients to undergo operation.
 Compared with surgically treated patients, conservatively treated patients who did not undergo operation and who had pathologic rhizography findings had pessimistic attitudes to possible surgery, often expressed a desire to retire, and considered their work as physically stressful.
 The women in this group were older and had lower pain indices than women who underwent operation.
 Conservatively treated patients with negative rhizography had more severe occupational handicaps, minor expectations of possible surgery, physically more strenuous jobs requiring difficult physical positions, and lower indices for pain and ADL than did the operated patients.

 This study assessed the utility of clinical electromyography (EMG) for detecting lower motor neuron (LMN) or upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction affecting the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and pharynx.
 Twenty-nine subjects were examined; their clinical diagnoses included perioperative nerve injury, cerebral infarction, and lateral medullary infarction.
 Resting activity, motor unit action potential (MUAP) morphology, and MUAP recruitment were evaluated in every case.
 Medical records (excluding EMG data) were analyzed for clinical evidence of LMN or UMN dysfunction in the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and pharynx.
 The diagnosis of LMN dysfunction rested on clinical data consistent with cranial nerve injury, poliomyelitis, Wallenberg syndrome, or unilateral bulbar palsy.
 Criteria for UMN dysfunction included previous cerebral (not brainstem) infarction or mass lesion or the presence of hemiparesis.
 Electromyographic abnormalities were significantly associated with LMN dysfunction (p less than .05), but they were not significantly associated with UMN dysfunction.

 Pneumocephalus occurs in 0.5 to 1.0% of head trauma, but may also occur after neurologic surgery, or as a result of eroding infection or neoplasm.
 The pathophysiology involves the presence of craniodural fistula allowing ingress of air.
 A ball-valve mechanism may allow air to enter but not exit the cranium, or CSF leak permits air entrance as fluid leaves the intracranial space.
 While a ""succession splash"" is considered diagnostic of pneumocephalus, most patients have nonspecific signs and symptoms such as headache.
 Therefore, a high index of suspicion in a patient with recent head trauma is necessary.
 The diagnosis is made radiographically by CT scan.
 This is generally performed to rule out intracranial hematoma or cerebral contusion in head trauma, but will reveal even very small quantities of air to the unsuspecting physician.
 Therapy is often noninvasive, allowing the craniodural defect to heal spontaneously.

542,"Low doses of IL-4 injected perilymphatically in tumor-bearing mice inhibit the growth of poorly and apparently nonimmunogenic tumors and induce a tumor-specific immune memory.
 The ability of rIL-4 to trigger host reactivity against both a chemically induced fibrosarcoma (CE-2) and a spontaneous adenocarcinoma (TS/A) of BALB/c mice was studied.
 Daily local s.c.
 administration around tumor draining lymph nodes of 10 injections of progressive amounts (0.00001 to 1000 pg/day) of rIL-4 induced appreciable inhibition of the growth of both tumors after a dose-response survival curve peaking at 0.1 pg/day.
 Inasmuch as rIL-4 has no direct antitumor activity, as shown by in vitro tests, host immune reactivity plays a fundamental role in this lymphokine activated tumor inhibition (LATI).
 LATI, in fact, is abolished when recipient mice are sublethally irradiated or treated with cyclosporin A, or when the reactivity of CD4+ lymphocytes is suppressed, whereas it is not affected by anti-asialo GM1 antibody.
 The morphologic data show that rIL-4 LATI rests on the recruitment of several cell reaction mechanisms, among which those that are nonspecific seem to predominate.
 rIL-4 LATI also leads to a state of long lasting and specific immune memory: the growth of a second contralateral tumor challenge is significantly impaired after LATI.
 This immune memory takes place after LATI of both the poorly immunogenic CE-2 fibrosarcoma and the TS/A adenocarcinoma, previously classed as nonimmunogenic on the basis of immunization-protection tests.
 In the latter case, adoptive transfer experiments show that Thy-1+ lymphocytes and, in particular, the CD4 cell-depleted T lymphocyte subpopulation, are responsible for the immune memory.
 Finally, the ability of rIL-4 to trigger LATI is greater than that of the most effective doses of rIL-2, rIL-1 beta, and IFN-gamma, whereas its association with rIL-1 beta induces a more effective immune memory.

 To further evaluate the clinical relevance of these observations, 39 patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian carcinoma were entered onto a phase II trial of intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin (100 to 105 mg/m2 per course) plus cytarabine (600 to 900 mg per course).
 Treatment was administered over 2 or 3 days for a maximum of five monthly courses, followed by surgical reevaluation in patients without clinical evidence of disease.
 The 3-day regimen was discontinued secondary to the development of severe thrombocytopenia (five of 12 courses platelets decreased to less than 50,000/mm3).
 Additional toxicities included abdominal pain (moderate to severe at some time during therapy in 46% of patients), fever without evidence of infection (44%), and bacterial peritonitis (10%).

 SAAST scores ranged from 2 to 26 with a mean score of 10.8.
 Forty-eight percent (10/21) had SAAST scores greater than or equal to 10, indicating ""probable alcoholism""; 62% (13/21) scored 8 or higher.
 Every patient with a SAAST score of 8 or higher also met DSM-III-R criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence on the basis of patient interview, independent chart reviews, and interviews of significant others.

 The acute hemodynamic effects of a new dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, diperdipine, which is suitable for intravenous administration, were studied by right and left cardiac catheterization in 16 patients with coronary heart disease.
 Diperdipine markedly reduced systemic vascular resistance and improved stroke index and left ventricular ejection fraction.
 Mean pulmonary artery and wedge pressures were slightly increased as a possible consequence of enhanced venous return, whereas right atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures were not significantly changed.
 Nevertheless, an increase in preload was clearly indicated by an augmented left ventricular end-diastolic volume index after administration of diperdipine.
 Left ventricular contractility, which was estimated by the end-systolic pressure-volume ratio and by dP/dt max was not significantly changed, though analysis of individual data suggests a minimally negative inotropic effect.
 However, such a minor effect on left ventricular contractility was largely counterbalanced by the marked reduction of afterload, which produced a sharp improvement of stroke index.
 Enhancement of left ventricular ejection fraction and reduction in systemic vascular resistance were inversely and directly correlated to control values.
 Overall, diperdipine was well tolerated, but one patient had a major untoward reaction that consisted of an ischemic episode that was possibly related to drug administration.
 In conclusion, intravenous diperdipine appears to be a potent arteriolar dilating agent that does not affect left ventricular contractility.

 The following results were obtained: When mixtures of the first series were analyzed, FC analysis detected from 1% to 10% of breast cancer cells in bone marrow (0.2% was a border line value), the morphologic method detected from 0.05% to 10%, and the immunocytochemic method, which was clearly superior, detected breast cancer cells in all mixtures (from 0.00025% to 10%).
 It was noted that, with both the morphologic and immunocytochemic methods, the percentage of breast cancer cells detected was 2 to 360 times higher than the percentage of added cells, and enrichment was inversely proportional to the percentage of added cells.
 This result could be a result of different separation of cells during centrifugation due to the different density of breast cancer cells.

549,"Treatment with deferoxamine during ischemia improves functional and metabolic recovery and reduces reperfusion-induced oxygen radical generation in rabbit hearts 
 BACKGROUND.
 Iron may play a central role in oxygen radical generation during myocardial ischemia and after reperfusion.
 Because conditions during ischemia may also liberate iron, we hypothesized that administration of the iron chelator deferoxamine during ischemia would result in improved functional and metabolic recovery after postischemic reperfusion.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Isolated, perfused rabbit hearts were studied by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
 The hearts received one of three treatments: deferoxamine at the onset of 30 minutes of global ischemia (n = 9), deferoxamine as a bolus followed by a continuous 15-minute infusion begun at reflow (n = 9), or standard perfusate (n = 7).
 Hearts treated with deferoxamine during ischemia showed better recovery of developed pressure than did control hearts (63.2 +/- 7.5% versus 41.2 +/- 2.9% of baseline) (p = 0.02) and better recovery of myocardial phosphocreatine content (92.4 +/- 10.3% versus 68.2 +/- 4.5% of baseline, p less than 0.05).
 These functional and metabolic benefits were comparable to those obtained with deferoxamine treatment during early reperfusion.
 In 15 additional hearts, intraischemic treatment with deferoxamine resulted in no reduction in oxygen radical concentrations as measured on frozen tissue by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at end ischemia, but the treatment eliminated the reperfusion-induced increase of free radical generation observed in control hearts (2.9 +/- 0.01 versus 7.0 +/- 0.07 microM, p less than 0.001).
 The magnitude of reduction was similar to that when deferoxamine was given at the onset of reflow (2.4 +/- 0.02 microM, p less than 0.001 versus control).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 These results demonstrate improved functional and metabolic recovery of myocardium treated with deferoxamine during ischemia, accompanied by a reduction in reperfusion-induced oxygen free-radical generation to the same degree as reflow treatment, confirming the importance of iron in the pathogenesis of myocardial reperfusion injury.

550,"Regulatory control of the terminal complement proteins at the surface of human endothelial cells: neutralization of a C5b-9 inhibitor by antibody to CD59.
 Functionally inhibitory antibody to the plasma membrane complement inhibitor CD59 has been used to investigate control of the terminal complement proteins at the endothelial cell surface.
 Antibodies against purified human erythrocyte CD59 (polyclonal anti-CD59 and monoclonal antibodies [MoAbs] 1F1 and 1F5) were found to bind specifically to monolayers of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and by Western blotting to recognize an 18- to 21-Kd endothelial protein.
 When bound to the endothelial monolayer, anti-CD59 (immunoglobulin G or Fab fragment) potentiated membrane pore formation induced upon C9 binding to C5b-8, and augmented the C5b-9-induced cellular responses, including stimulated secretion of von Willebrand factor and expression of catalytic surface for the prothrombinase enzyme complex.
 Although potentiating endothelial responses to the terminal complement proteins, anti-CD59 had no effect on the response of these cells to stimulation by histamine.
 Taken together, these data suggest that human endothelial cells express the CD59 cell surface inhibitor of the terminal complement proteins, which serves to protect these cells from pore-forming and cell-stimulatory effects of the C5b-9 complex.
 These data also suggest that the inactivation or deletion of this cell surface regulatory molecule would increase the likelihood for procoagulant changes in endothelium exposed to complement activation in plasma.

 Because of the excellent long-term outcome and the lack of hemodynamic compromise during the rhythm, it seems reasonable to withhold antiarrhythmic therapy in infants with accelerated ventricular rhythm and await resolution of the rhythm.

554,"Organ procurement in patients with fatal head injuries. The fate of the potential donor.
 A 46-month, retrospective review of all victims of fatal head injury at a level 1 trauma center was undertaken to estimate donor organ availability, determine causes of procurement failure, and analyze the functional results of organs transplanted from this group of donors.
 Causes of procurement failure in 126 patients who died principally from their head injuries included failure of initial resuscitation (14%), ineligibility (28%), failure of physiologic support (14%), and denial of consent (20%).
 Of 73 eligible donors, 29 (41%) were able to donate one or more vascular organs (heart, liver, kidney).
 In only one instance was an eligible donor not appropriately identified as such.
 Failure of physiologic support to prevent early death (25%), and denial of consent (34%) were found to be the two major, potentially remediable causes of procurement failure in this series.
 Based on this data, an estimated 29 patients/million population/year will survive initially and meet all eligibility requirements for organ donation.
 Data on 47 kidneys transplanted from the donor group demonstrated a 77% overall graft survival rate at a follow-up period averaging 23 months.
 Prolonged donor hypotension, but not the use of high-dose vasopressors, adversely affected allograft survival.
 The current limitations of organ procurement in victims of fatal head injury stem from a limited ability to maintain cardiopulmonary function long enough for the procurement process to be completed and a high overall rate (46%) of denial of consent for organ harvest by next of kin.

555,"Role of ultrasonic tissue characterization to distinguish reversible from irreversible myocardial injury.
 Tissue characterization reflects structural and functional integrity of tissues.
 Inasmuch as reversible ischemia causes no structural damage and irreversible ischemia results in persistent structural myocardial damage, we postulated that ultrasonic tissue characterization can distinguish the two types of injuries.
 Anesthetized open chest dogs underwent 15 minutes (group 1, n = 5) and 90 minutes (group 2, n = 8) of acute total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by 3 hours of reperfusion.
 Myocardial ischemia-infarction was confirmed with segment shortening, electronmicroscopic examination, and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining.
 Integrated backscatter Rayleigh 5 (IBR5), a measure of ultrasonic backscatter, and Fourier coefficient of amplitude modulation (FAM), an index of cardiac cycle dependent variation in backscatter, were measured at baseline, during ischemia, and after reperfusion.
 Group 1 (reversible ischemia) showed an increase in IBR5 from -48 +/- 1.2 dB at control to -45 +/- 1.0 dB (p less than 0.01) during ischemia, which returned to baseline after reperfusion (-47 +/- 1.3 dB).
 FAM was blunted during ischemia (6.2 +/- 1.0 dB during control versus 1.2 +/- 1.0 dB during ischemia, p less than 0.01) and recovered completely during reperfusion.
 Segment shortening was abolished during ischemia (18% +/- 3% during control versus -12% +/- 5% during ischemia, p less than 0.01) and recovered partially during reperfusion (4% +/- 5%).
 The group 2 animals with irreversible myocardial injury showed an increase in IBR5, from -49 +/- 1.2 dB during control to -44 +/- 1.0 dB during ischemia (p less than 0.01) and paradoxical bulging of the ischemic region (17% +/- 3% to -7% +/- 3%, p less than 0.01) during ischemia.

 Mechanical acceleration is a countermeasure that may be employed to prevent atrophy of slow-twitch muscle during non-weight bearing.
 In the present study, daily centrifugation of rats for different durations (1 or 2 h) and at different gravitational intensities (1.5 or 2.6 G) was used to test whether mechanical acceleration could ameliorate the atrophy of the soleus muscle induced by non-weight bearing (tail-traction model).
 The soleus muscle atrophied 32% during 7 days of non-weight bearing without countermeasures.
 Centrifugation treatment did not completely prevent atrophy relative to precontrol wet weight of the soleus muscle.
 Non-weight-bearing groups receiving 2-h daily treatments of 1, 1.5, or 2.6 G had 48, 56, and 65%, respectively, of the atrophy observed in the non-weight-bearing-only group compared with the precontrol group.

 The culpability, crash-related traffic convictions, and pre- and post-crash driving records of a group of injured impaired (blood alcohol level greater than 80 mg/dl) drivers (N = 58) who were admitted to a Level I trauma center were compared with a group of admitted unimpaired drivers (N = 92).
 Both groups of drivers were 21 years of age or older, sustained moderate injuries (defined as having no injury of the brain, spinal column or cord, extremity, or pelvis with an Abbreviated Injury Score of greater than 2), and were discharged home.
 In the 140 crashes in which culpability was clearly defined, the impaired drivers caused a significantly greater percentage of their crashes (92.7%) compared to unimpaired (64.7%) drivers (p less than 0.001).
 Of the 55 unimpaired drivers who were considered culpable of causing their crashes, 12.7% received a traffic conviction compared with 39.2% of the 51 culpable impaired drivers.
 The mean number of total pre-crash traffic violations was higher for impaired drivers than for unimpaired drivers (p less than 0.01).
 While the mean number of total post-crash convictions for unimpaired and impaired was not significantly different, the mean number of pre- and post-crash alcohol convictions was significantly higher for impaired drivers compared to unimpaired drivers (p less than 0.02).
 The data suggest that injury protects from legal prosecution and does not alter impaired driving practices.

559,"Effective surgical adjuvant therapy for high-risk rectal carcinoma 
 BACKGROUND.
 Radiation therapy as an adjunct to surgery for rectal cancer has been shown to reduce local recurrence but has not improved survival.
 In a previous study, combined radiation and chemotherapy improved survival significantly as compared with surgery alone, but not as compared with adjuvant radiation, which many regard as standard therapy.
 We designed a combination regimen to optimize the contribution of chemotherapy, decrease recurrence, and improve survival as compared with adjuvant radiation alone.
 METHODS.
 Two hundred four patients with rectal carcinoma that was either deeply invasive or metastatic to regional lymph nodes were randomly assigned to postoperative radiation alone (4500 to 5040 cGy) or to radiation plus fluorouracil, which was both preceded and followed by a cycle of systemic therapy with fluorouracil plus semustine (methyl-CCNU).
 RESULTS.
 After a median follow-up of more than seven years, the combined therapy had reduced the recurrence of rectal cancer by 34 percent (P = 0.0016; 95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 50 percent).
 Initial local recurrence was reduced by 46 percent (P = 0.036; 95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 70 percent), and distant metastasis by 37 percent (P = 0.011; 95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 57 percent).
 In addition, combined therapy reduced the rate of cancer-related deaths by 36 percent (P = 0.0071; 95 percent confidence interval, 14 to 53 percent) and the overall death rate by 29 percent (P = 0.025; 95 percent confidence interval, 7 to 45 percent).
 Its acute toxic effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.
 These effects were seldom severe.
 Severe, delayed treatment-related reactions, usually small-bowel obstruction requiring surgery, occurred in 6.7 percent of all patients receiving radiation, and the frequencies of these complications were comparable in both treatment groups.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The combination of postoperative local therapy with radiation plus fluorouracil and systemic therapy with a fluorouracil-based regimen significantly and substantively improves the results of therapy for rectal carcinoma with a poor prognosis, as compared with postoperative radiation alone.

561,"Regulation of the truncation of luteinizing hormone receptors at the plasma membrane is different in rat and mouse Leydig cells.
 Regulation of the truncation of LH receptors was investigated in two types of mouse tumor Leydig cells (MA10 and MLTC-1), rat testis Leydig cells (RTL), and a rat tumor Leydig cell (R2C).
 Receptor numbers were measured by binding [125I]hCG to the cells cultured in monolayers.
 Addition of 3.3 nM LH for 2 h at 34 C had no detectable effect on binding sites in RTL or R2C cells, but in MA10 and MLTC-1 cells it caused a loss in binding sites.
 The effect on MA10 and MLTC-1 cells could be mimicked by inhibiting receptor internalization with 5 mM NaN3 and prevented by the addition of protease inhibitors.
 Incubating RTL and R2C cells with protease inhibitors caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in binding sites and a 2- to 3-fold increase in LH (0.033 and 0.33 nM)-stimulated cAMP production.
 When RTL and MA10 cells were incubated in the presence of [125I]hCG, a radioactive protein complex with an approximate mol wt of 80,000-90,000 was released into the incubation medium.
 We conclude that LH receptors are regulated by proteolysis at the plasma membrane in both mouse and rat Leydig cells.
 Furthermore, truncation of the LH receptor in the mouse Leydig cells is involved in down-regulation, whereas in the rat it is a continuous process.

 The purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics of blood pressure rhythms in school-age children and to compare the circadian mesors and amplitudes between children of normotensive parents and children of hypertensive parents.
 The sample consisted of 40 healthy children between 8 and 10 years old; 20 children had a parental history of hypertension and 20 did not.
 Blood pressure was measured every 2 hours during the day and every 90 minutes during the night for one 24-hour cycle using a Dinamap monitor equipped with an automatic printer.
 Cosinor analyses revealed statistically significant circadian rhythms for systolic and diastolic blood pressures in 12 of the 40 subjects.
 The acrophases for systolic and diastolic pressures occurred between 1200-1800 hours.
 The mean systolic mesor was 108.50 while the mean diastolic mesor was 61.41.
 The mean amplitudes were 8.85 for systolic pressure and 7.44 for diastolic pressure.

 In rats, verapamil decreases intestinal absorption of calcium, increases serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), and induces osteopenia.
 In this prospective study, verapamil 80-120 mg three times daily was given for 2 months to 20 patients with hypertension, and the effects on calcium homeostasis were recorded.
 This dose of verapamil significantly reduced supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (+/- SD) from 158/100 +/- 9/8 mmHg to 146/89 +/- 14/8 mmHg (P = 0.001).
 Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased significantly from 2.77 +/- 1.06 mu kat l-1 to 3.19 +/- 1.22 mu kat l-1 (P = 0.004), and isoenzymes of ALP of skeletal origin appeared after verapamil treatment.
 The excretion of sodium in the urine increased (Na/creatinine ratio 8.95 +/- 6.01 before and 13.16 +/- 8.26 after verapamil; P = 0.04), while the excretion of calcium, phosphate and potassium was not changed.
 PTH was slightly increased at the end of verapamil treatment (1.09 +/- 0.54 vs.
 0.98 +/- 0.74 microgram l-1; P = 0.07), and s-1,25(OH)2D3 was also somewhat increased (22.3 +/- 14.4 vs.

 Serum Ca was not affected by verapamil (before verapamil 2.43 +/- 0.11 mmol l-1, after verapamil 2.40 +/- 0.12 mmol l-1; P = 0.28).
 The increase in serum ALP demonstrates that verapamil affects bone cell metabolism in man.
 This effect could be secondary to the enhancement of PTH secretion.

565,"Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine and serious neurologic illness: an updated review of the epidemiologic evidence.
 A widespread impression that DTP vaccine does cause brain damage has been based first on historical precedent--smallpox and rabies vaccines were recognized as sometimes causing devastating neurologic illness; analogy to pertussis--the disease can cause encephalopathy; and more recently on anecdotal evidence, particularly case series.
 A noncausal relationship--coincidence--could explain the temporal relation between DTP vaccine and neurologic illness, inasmuch as DTP vaccine is given at the age of emergence of idiopathic neurologic disease.
 The relationship between DTP vaccine and neurologic illness lacks specificity.
 Case series have had an impact on both physicians' and the lay public's impression of the safety of pertussis vaccine greatly out of proportion to their scientific importance.
 Case series can be useful for generating hypotheses but cannot provide evidence that pertussis vaccine is causally related to acute neurologic illness or brain damage.
 Observational studies using cohort and ecologic designs did not find an association between DTP vaccine and serious neurologic illness, but they were not powerful enough to detect an association as rare as that observed by the NCES investigators.
 The case-control design offers the best chance of providing causal evidence regarding DTP vaccine and serious neurologic illness.
 The NCES is the only published case-control study of this issue.
 This study found a rare association between DTP vaccine and some types of acute neurologic illness.
 Bias and chance are unlikely to account entirely for the association demonstrated by the NCES.
 However, the association has not yet been replicated by other case-control studies.
 The NCES does not demonstrate that DTP vaccine causes permanent brain damage.

 Are event-related potentials and nonconcurrently measured neuropsychological test performance correlated? Sober male and female middle-aged alcoholics and peer controls were administered an ""oddball"" event-related potential (ERP) task and several hours later, a battery of neuropsychological (NP) tests.
 Alcoholics performed significantly poorer than controls on NP tests.
 Male alcoholics had significantly altered ERP responses (N1, NdA, and P3 amplitudes) but female alcoholics did not differ on any ERP variables from controls.
 A number of significant correlations between ERP and NP measures were present.
 The most consistent findings were positive correlations between perceptual-motor (PM) tests and the P3 amplitude at Pz in both male and female alcoholics and in male alcoholics, a negative correlation between PM tests and P3 latency at Pz, findings similar to those seen in Parkinson patients.
 Significant correlations were most numerous in family history positive alcoholics.
 The results lead to two conclusions: first, Grant's postulation that sober alcoholics may manifest an intermediate duration organic mental disorder is supported; second, given the lack of ERP differences in the females, ERP measures should not be considered as being causally related to NP performance.

569,"The mechanism of spastic muscle hypertonus. Variation in reflex gain over the time course of spasticity.
 The electromyographic (EMG) response of the initially passive biceps brachii muscle to imposed extension applied at the elbow was studied in 19 hemiparetic and 12 normal subjects.
 In relaxed normal subjects, the biceps muscle was found to respond only at displacement velocities above 175 deg/s, with a single early burst of activity in the biceps EMG.
 In contrast, the hemiparetic subjects, in addition to the early EMG activity, also showed considerable late activity, which persisted even with stretch velocities as low as 35 deg/s.
 This late activity is a stretch reflex, present in fully plegic arms.
 It was seen in all spastic subjects in whom the tone of the biceps had been clinically assessed to be raised, but was never observed in subjects with normal muscle tone.
 The mean level of this EMG response was highly correlated with displacement velocity and its duration to the duration of the applied displacement.
 It is suggested that this reflex EMG activity is the major factor in the genesis of spastic hypertonus in the arm and that it arises not from a reduction in the threshold of the stretch reflexes of the muscle, but from a pathological increase in stretch reflex gain.
 It is further shown that this activity is at a high level between the first and third months after the onset of spasticity and that the reflex gain is significantly reduced when spasticity is established for a year or more.
 It is concluded that, while changes in passive mechanical properties may play a role when spasticity has been established for more than a year, the major cause of spastic muscle hypertonus is a pathological increase in stretch reflex activity.

 All the parameters were evaluated on serial cryostat sections representative of a closely related, if not identical, neoplastic population.

 Furthermore, ER, PgR, and PNA receptors showed a significant, inverse correlation with Ki-67 immunoreactivity, mitotic index, and mean number of Ag-NOR.
 These results provide further data that support the hypothesis that (1) progesterone and PNA receptors are estrogen-induced and indicate a metabolic response of the target cells to functioning estrogen receptors; (2) the mean number of NOR reflects the cell kinetics of the tumor; and (3) metabolic differentiation of neoplastic cells is inversely correlated to the proliferation index.

 To assess the utility of routine duplex surveillance, 379 infrainguinal reversed vein grafts performed at two independent teaching hospitals were prospectively entered into a surveillance protocol from March 1986 through August 1989.
 An average of 3.2 postoperative duplex graft flow velocity (GFV) measurements per graft was obtained during a mean follow-up interval of 21 1/2 months.
 Only 2.1% of 280 grafts with GFV measurements greater than 45 cm/sec failed within 6 months of a normal surveillance examination.
 GFV measurements less than 45 cm/sec in 99 grafts led to arteriography in 75 grafts, identifying 50 stenotic lesions in 48 bypasses (12.6% of series).
 Inflow lesions were present in 5%, outflow stenoses in 2%, and intrinsic graft stenoses in only 6% of bypasses.
 Only 29% of grafts identified as failing by duplex scan were associated with a reduction in ankle-brachial index of greater than 0.15.
 Secondary reconstructions were performed in 48 grafts based on detection of a reduced GFV measurement; all such reconstructions are patent after a mean follow-up of 5 months.

 This article addresses the methodology of sodium sensitivity assessment.
 There have been reports to suggest that a high sodium intake is a cause of elevated blood pressure and trials to indicate that a reduction in sodium intake may reduce blood pressure that is already high; the implications of these findings are discussed.
 Many studies on sodium sensitivity suffer from what could be called the ""normal probability fallacy""; without appropriate control conditions, an intervention such as sodium restriction may incorrectly be assigned to a more pronounced response in a subgroup of the study population.
 As an example, findings are reviewed of age and sex as determinants of a response of blood pressure to variations in sodium intake.
 The limited data available suggest that subjects that are older and have higher blood pressure levels seem to benefit more from a reduction in sodium intake.
 In addition, elderly subjects at a high dietary sodium intake may have a higher risk of developing hypertension.
 Findings in both nonexperimental and experimental studies tend to support this view.
 Findings on sex differences are less consistent.
 A systematic approach to the assessment of factors and mechanisms responsible for sodium sensitivity in some subjects is needed to determine who might benefit most.
 Until more data are available, there is little basis to discriminate sodium-sensitive from sodium-resistant hypertensive subjects.

 Thereafter headache occurred while regional cerebral blood flow remained decreased.
 During the headache phase, regional cerebral blood flow gradually changed from abnormally low to abnormally high without apparent change in headache.
 In some patients headache disappeared while regional cerebral blood flow remained increased.
 Although regional cerebral blood flow reduction and aura symptoms in the great majority of patients were unilateral, one-third had bilateral headache.
 Unilateral headache usually localized to the side on which regional cerebral blood flow was reduced and from which the aura symptoms originated (i.e., aura symptoms were perceived to occur contralaterally but presumably originated in the hypoperfused hemisphere).
 Our results suggest a simple model for migraine attacks: A pathological disturbance in one cerebral hemisphere causes the aura symptoms and after a time delay, it also causes the headache by stimulating local vascular nociceptors.
 Bilateral headache caused by a unilateral cerebral disturbance may be explained by recent neuroanatomical and neurophysiological findings.

 The purpose of this article is to review research related to the use of clinical analysis of movement as an aid to the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy.
 A historical perspective of clinical techniques used by physicians and physical therapists in the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy will be presented first, including recent research findings on clinical signs that were most predictive of this movement disorder.
 Predictive neuromotor behaviors common across several recent studies will be highlighted.
 Future trends in the use of movement analysis, including digitized kinematic analysis of term and preterm infants and fetal ultrasound techniques, will be discussed as well.

585,"Anti-ischemic effects of atenolol versus nifedipine in patients with coronary artery disease and ambulatory silent ischemia.
 The anti-ischemic effects of atenolol and nifedipine were compared in a randomized double-blind crossover manner in 24 patients with stable exertional angina and transient silent ischemia during ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring.
 Both atenolol and nifedipine were effective (p less than 0.005) in reducing the average number and duration of transient ischemic events, but therapy with atenolol was associated with a significantly greater reduction in the mean number (p less than 0.05) and duration (p less than 0.01) of silent ischemic events.
 Analyses of the silent ischemic activity during the morning hours revealed that only therapy with atenolol produced a significant reduction in the average duration per patient (139 +/- 54 vs.
 1,609 +/- 468 s, p less than 0.01) and in the average duration of silent ischemia per event between 6 AM and 12 noon (62 +/- 21 vs.
 208 +/- 24 s, p less than 0.005).
 There were fewer adverse experiences during therapy with atenolol.
 These results show that although both atenolol and nifedipine are effective in reducing silent ischemic events, treatment with atenolol is associated with significantly greater efficacy, particularly on the morning surge of silent myocardial ischemia.

586,"Borderzone hemodynamics in cerebrovascular disease.
 To investigate the possible existence of chronic selective hemodynamic impairment in the arterial borderzone regions of the brain, we used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure regional mean vascular transit time (rt, equal to the ratio of regional cerebral blood volume to cerebral blood flow) and regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) in 32 patients with either severe internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion and 11 normal controls.
 Twenty-four of the patients had had TIAs or amaurosis fugax from 1 to 60 days before PET; all had normal brain CT.
 We used a stereotactic localization method to locate the anterior and posterior borderzone regions of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory.
 We then calculated ratios of each borderzone to the ipsilateral MCA territory for both rt and rOEF.
 There was no significant difference from control ratios in any patient subgroup including those with greater than or equal to 75% stenosis or occlusion, those with or without contralateral greater than or equal to 50% stenosis, or those with abnormal hemodynamics in the MCA territory.
 We therefore found no evidence for selective borderzone hemodynamic impairment in this group of patients with severe carotid artery disease.

 The purpose of this study was to compare transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of various types of atrial septal defects.
 Forty-one adult patients with the clinical diagnosis of atrial septal defect were studied by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (30 women, 11 men; 18 to 81 years of age).
 Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated the atrial septal defect in 33 patients (secundum type in 28, primum type in 3 and sinus venosus type in 2).
 Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated the defect in all 41 patients.
 Thus, in 8 (20%) of 41 patients the atrial septal defect was demonstrated by transesophageal and not by transthoracic echocardiography.
 Six of the eight had a sinus venosus type atrial septal defect; the other two patients had a secundum atrial septal defect (one of these two had a technically poor transthoracic echocardiogram and the other had a small atrial septal defect).
 Transthoracic echocardiography, therefore, failed to demonstrate the sinus venosus defect in six (75%) of eight patients.
 An anomalous venous connection associated with the sinus venosus defect was visualized by transesophageal echocardiography in seven of the eight patients but was not seen on transthoracic echocardiography in any patient.
 Sinus venosus type atrial septal defects are frequently not visualized in adults by conventional transthoracic echocardiography.
 Transesophageal echocardiography is recommended when an atrial septal defect is clinically suspected but cannot be visualized by transthoracic echocardiography.

 Because a malignancy was suspected, the patient was imaged with gamma camera using radiolabeled monoclonal anticarcinoembryonal antigen antibody including single photon emission computed tomography.
 The radioantibody accumulated strongly into the neoplasm.
 Tumor to background ratio was 2.2.
 Samples of the excised tumor were stained immunohistochemically for desmin, vimentin, muscle actin, cytokeratin, CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), and factor VIII.
 They showed that the antibody uptake was of unspecific nature and not due to CEA expression in the tumor.

 To compare the relative diagnostic value of exercise echocardiography with perfusion technetium-99m metoxyisobutylisonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in detecting coronary artery disease (CAD), 75 patients with suspected CAD but a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest were included in a prospective correlative study.
 Both the exercise echocardiograms and SPECT studies were performed in conjunction with the same symptom-limited bicycle exercise test.
 The development of either a new wall motion abnormality or a reversible perfusion defect after exercise, or both, were regarded as a positive test for the exercise echocardiographic and SPECT studies, respectively.
 The results of these 2 diagnostic tests were compared with coronary arteriography.
 Exercise echocardiography identified 35 (71%) and SPECT 41 (84%, p = 0.13) of the 49 patients with significant CAD (defined as greater than 50% diameter stenosis).
 Twenty-five of the 26 patients (96%) without significant coronary stenosis had negative exercise echocardiographic results and 23 of 26 (88%) had negative SPECT results.
 Exercise-induced new wall motion abnormalities showed a good correlation with reversible perfusion defects, and the results of the 2 methods were concordant in 65 of 75 patients (agreement = 88%, kappa = 0.75 +/- 0.14).
 Both the diagnostic accuracy of exercise echocardiography and SPECT were significantly higher than the exercise ECG (81 vs 64%, p less than 0.02 and 88 vs 64%, p less than 0.005).

 Neutrophils from the peripheral blood of rabbits preadministered systemic TNF showed impaired ability to migrate toward chemoattractants in vitro.
 In addition, systemic TNF administration suppressed zymosan-activated plasma-induced local accumulation of leukocytes in mouse skin.

 To examine the specificity of technetium-99m monoclonal antibody (S12) imaging for identifying activated platelets at interventional injury sites in atherosclerotic rabbit arteries, subgroups of unheparinized rabbits (n = 39) underwent serial percutaneous transluminal aortic angioplasty (PTA) procedures (with or without intravascular stent placement) followed by in vivo and then ex vivo gamma camera imaging, scanning, and immunoelectron microscopy to determine the intravascular loci of S12 Fab' antibody binding.
 Despite angiographic vessel patency, image-derived ratios of in vivo S12 binding in injured versus uninjured vascular segments were significantly increased (p less than 0.05) after one PTA (1.3 +/- 0.17, n = 7), PTA twice at 6-week intervals (1.4 +/- 0.22, n = 7), and PTA plus stent placement (1.6 +/- 0.28, n = 7) compared with control experiments (1.1 +/- 0.13, n = 7).
 Ex vivo imaging of blood-free excised aortas confirmed S12 localization at PTA (2 +/- 0.4, n = 3) and PTA plus stent placement (5 +/- 3.8, n = 7) sites (both p less than 0.05 versus controls).
 S12 antibody uptake decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) at 1 week after PTA plus stent placement in vivo (1.1 +/- 0.10, n = 4) and ex vivo (1.6 +/- 0.7, n = 3).
 Electron microscopic studies confirmed dense platelet, fibrin, and red blood cell deposition in regions of acute injury, with endothelial neointimal proliferation at 1 week after PTA.
 Immunoelectron microscopic studies confirmed specific in vivo S12 binding (22:1 versus nonrelevant IgG) at sites of alpha-granule GMP-140 expression in activated platelets.
 Therefore, S12 studies may be useful to localize sites of platelet-derived mitogen release at arterial PTA injury sites.

 Colonoscopy with biopsy is the standard of practice for the diagnosis of colonic malignancies.
 Unfortunately, the inability of endoscopy to obtain precise distance measurements from the anal verge can make localization of lesions at operation difficult.
 For this reason, preoperative barium enema or intraoperative colonoscopy have been advocated to further pinpoint the sites of those lesions not thought to be easily located at operation.
 Five patients are presented in whom malignant lesions of the colon were diagnosed and verified histologically, but were later undetectable at operation or subsequent colonoscopic examinations.
 Four of these patients underwent laparotomy and three received colon resections.
 None of these patients' tumors were identified during intraoperative colonoscopy, in the resected bowel on pathologic examination, or on follow-up colonoscopy.
 A fifth patient is presented who spontaneously passed a polyp containing invasive adenocarcinoma, but multiple colonoscopic examinations have failed to identify the site of the lesion.
 To date, none of these tumors have recurred with periods of follow-up ranging from 6 months to 2 years.
 These patients demonstrate a poorly documented and little understood aspect of the behavior of colonic malignancies, i.e., the ability to spontaneously regress or slough from the bowel wall.
 Based on these instances, localization of potentially malignant colon lesions is recommended with submucosal dye injections at initial endoscopy or with colonoscopy in the operating room immediately prior to operation.

 The ED50 and ED90 values for suxamethonium were 0.08 mg/kg and 0.20 mg/kg, and an infusion rate of 3.2 mg/kg/hour was required to maintain a 90-95% depression of the single twitch response as monitored by integrated electromyography.

 The authors present a new diagnostic procedure to quickly and noninvasively diagnose the popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.
 A large personal experience on the surgical treatment of such a disease (29 cases in 22 patients) allowed us to focus on the optimal diagnostic procedure useful to detect this problem at an early stage.
 The technique is based on continuous-wave Doppler and duplex scanning studies done both in the resting state and during active contraction of the calf muscles.
 If compression of the popliteal artery occurs with contraction of the calf muscles, it will be detected by a decrease in flow.
 This finding will also direct the radiologist to obtain films when the maneuver is repeated.
 This makes it unlikely that the diagnosis will be missed.
 Since July 1988 a total of 1212 patients were evaluated with continuous-wave Doppler for suspected chronic ischemia.
 From this group 41 patients were selected to be studied again with the combined continuous-wave Doppler and duplex scanning method for possible popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.
 Two cases were discovered and verified by dynamic angiography guided by continuous-wave Doppler and treated surgically.

 The major side effects of racemic oxybutynin (OXY), which is used in the treatment of urinary incontinence are dry mouth (xerostomia) and blurred vision (mydriasis).
 Highly purified enantiomers of OXY [(R)OXY, (S)OXY] were compared with the racemate both in vitro in functional studies and in vivo in guinea pigs to evaluate their pharmacological action relative to their adverse effects.
 The affinity of (R)OXY and (S)OXY for different muscarinic receptor subtypes was determined using field stimulated rabbit vas deferens (M1) and guinea pig atria (M2) or bladder (M3) strips.
 Stereoselective antimuscarinic effects [(R)OXY greater than or equal to (R/S) OXY much greater than (S)OXY] were evident at all three receptor subtypes; the isomeric ratio [(S)OXY/(R)OXY] ranged from 12 to 88.
 Both (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY were slightly more selective (2-4-fold, P less than .01) for M1 and M3 relative to M2 muscarinic receptors.
 Stereoselectivity was also evident in vivo for volume-induced urinary bladder contractions as measured by cystometrogram parameters [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 21], mydriasis [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 136] and salivary gland secretory responses [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 30].
 The absolute potencies of (R)OXY or (R/S)OXY for mydriasis and salivation were similar to those for inhibition of intravesical bladder pressure.
 Also, (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY equipotently antagonized cholinergic-mediated CNS effects in mice.
 Collectively, the data suggest that the activity of (R/S)OXY resides predominantly in the (R)-enantiomer.
 However, it appears that (R)OXY may offer no significant pharmacological advantage over (R/S)OXY in terms of its principal therapeutic and side effect profile.

 STUDY OBJECTIVES: Accurate core temperature measurement in severely hypovolemic patients can be difficult to achieve.
 We used a dog model to determine both a convenient method of measuring core temperature and the relative accuracy of the multiple sites.
 DESIGN: Prospective laboratory (animal model) study.
 SETTING: Operating suites in the Animal Care Department.
 PARTICIPANTS: Eight adult, anesthetized greyhound dogs.
 INTERVENTIONS: Continuous temperature monitoring by thermistors placed in the brain, central vein, tympanic membrane, bladder, rectum, esophagus, and subcutaneous tissue.
 Hemorrhage to 65% initial intravascular volume and autologous transfusion of cooled blood, during which serial temperature measurements were recorded.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The readings were analyzed with Pearson's correlation coefficient.
 Brain temperature correlated very well with tympanic membrane temperature throughout the course (r = .869, P less than .0005).
 Rectum, bladder, and esophagus also correlated well with brain.
 Central venous temperature, however, correlated poorly with temperatures at all other sites, reflecting the marked swings in intravascular temperature caused by cold transfusion.
 These wide variations were damped at the other sites.
 The best correlation of central venous temperature was with brain and bladder, although tympanic membrane correlation was fair.
 CONCLUSIONS: Because intravascular hypothermia appears to be the source of the arrhythmias and hemostatic abnormalities often seen during the early resuscitation of hypovolemic patients, our results suggest bladder or tympanic membrane as the initial temperature site.
 After the initial resuscitation, end organ (eg, brain) temperature is the most important and is most accurately reflected by tympanic membrane temperature.

 We investigated the nature of pulmonary disease in a patient with serologic evidence of HTLV-1 infection.
 In this case, endobronchial biopsy specimens showed infiltration of the bronchial mucosa by pleomorphic cells exhibiting a high degree of nuclear irregularity.
 These cells were morphologically identical in appearance to malignant cells found in peripheral blood and infiltrating the dermis, expressed the OKT4/Leu3 phenotype and the receptor for interleukin 2, and, by analogy to gene rearrangement studies on leukemic blood cells, were monoclonal in origin.
 However, in situ hybridization of endobronchial biopsy specimens with full-length HTLV-1 probes failed to detect retroviral RNA or proviral DNA.

 Six healthy volunteers and three patients with cardiac anomalies were studied in a comparison of segmented turboFLASH (fast low-angle shot) cine, a method of magnetic resonance imaging that permits an entire series of high-resolution cine images to be obtained in one breath hold, with standard cine.
 Segmented turboFLASH uses a gradient-echo sequence designed for short imaging times in combination with a segmented data acquisition method.
 Presaturation pulses were applied to eliminate the blood pool signal; the signal-to-noise ratio was assessed with a phantom.
 Standard hardware and image reconstruction methods were used.
 The breath-hold images consistently showed reduced ghosting and blurring from respiration.
 Because a very short echo time was used, segmented turboFLASH was relatively insensitive to dephasing caused by local field disturbances or flow.

 Either urokinase (4,400 U/kg bolus followed by 4,400 U/kg/h) or streptokinase (250,000 U bolus followed by 100,000 U/h) was used, and venograms were performed before and after.
 Overall, 56 percent of patients had complete clot lysis and relief of symptoms.
 Thrombolytic therapy was effective in eight (73 percent) of 11 patients receiving urokinase and one (20 percent) of five patients receiving streptokinase.
 Of those with a central venous catheter, eight (73 percent) of 11 patients were successfully lysed, whereas only one (20 percent) of five patients was successfully lysed if no catheter was present.

 Concomitantly, T-cell proliferation induced by PHA or Con A was suppressed.
 However, the number of T and B cells remained unchanged.
 The data demonstrate the impairment of early events in the lymphocyte program in severely burned patients.
 The activation of B cells is downregulated, since they become refractory to external helper signals.
 In addition, T cells are highly activated but fail to proceed to proliferation in response to mitogenic stimuli.

615,"Small cell carcinomas of the large intestine.
 The authors studied the clinical and pathologic features of 38 small cell carcinomas of the large intestine.
 Most were located in the right colon.
 Overlying adenomas were present in 45% and squamous differentiation in 21% of tumors.
 Endocrine differentiation was present in all tumors by at least one method; neuron-specific enolase, dense-core granules, and synaptophysin were present in most cases.
 Seventy-one percent of tumors metastasized to the liver; 64% of patients were dead at five months follow-up.
 Twenty-one poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and undifferentiated carcinomas of the large intestine accessioned during the same period showed less endocrine (7 of 21) and squamous differentiation (1 of 15) and fewer liver metastases (4 of 15) than did small cell carcinomas.
 Among all 59 tumors studied, small cell histologic characteristics correlated better with liver involvement than did endocrine markers or other histologic features.
 Small cell carcinomas of the large intestine are aggressive tumors with a propensity for early liver involvement.
 Although there is a spectrum of squamous, endocrine, and glandular features in large bowel tumors of low degrees of differentiation, the identification of a small cell component appears to be most clinically relevant.

 Calcium antagonists have been used successfully in the management of hypertension for more than a decade, but less is known about their long-term metabolic effects.
 To define the impact of one calcium antagonist, verapamil, on serum lipids and other metabolic parameters, we placed 45 hypertensive patients on verapamil monotherapy and followed them for 4 to 8 years.
 After a mean treatment period of 5.3 years, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significantly different from baseline, whereas the mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol value increased significantly from 1.17 +/- 0.41 mmol/L at the initiation of treatment to 1.39 +/- 0.36 mmol/L at 5.3 years (p less than 0.05).
 Other important biochemical parameters, including serum glucose, potassium and uric acid levels were unaffected by verapamil therapy.
 No serious side effects or adverse cardiovascular events occurred during verapamil therapy, and there were no study dropouts.
 It therefore seems likely that this agent will become increasingly useful in the long-term management of essential hypertension.

621,"Evidence that histamine is the causative toxin of scombroid-fish poisoning 
 BACKGROUND.
 The highest morbidity worldwide from fish poisoning results from the ingestion of spoiled scombroid fish, such as tuna and mackerel, and its cause is not clear.
 Histamine could be responsible, because spoiled scombroid fish contain large quantities of histamine.
 Whether histamine is the causative toxin, however, has remained in question.
 To address this issue, we investigated whether histamine homeostasis is altered in poisoned people.
 METHODS.
 The urinary excretion of histamine and its metabolite, N-methylhistamine, was measured in three persons who had scombroid-fish poisoning (scombrotoxism) after the ingestion of marlin.
 We measured 9 alpha, 11 beta-dihydroxy-15-oxo-2,3,18,19-tetranorprost-5-ene-1,20-dioic acid (PGD-M), the principal metabolite of prostaglandin D2, a mast-cell secretory product, to assess whether mast cells had been activated to release histamine.
 RESULTS.
 The fish contained high levels of histamine (842 to 2503 mumol per 100 g of tissue).
 Symptoms of scombrotoxism--flushing and headache--began 10 to 30 minutes after the ingestion of fish.
 In urine samples collected one to four hours after fish ingestion, the levels of histamine and N-methylhistamine were 9 to 20 times and 15 to 20 times the normal mean, respectively.
 During the subsequent 24 hours, the levels fell to 4 to 15 times and 4 to 11 times the normal values.
 Levels of both were normal 14 days later.
 PGD-M excretion was not increased at any time.
 Two persons treated with diphenhydramine had prompt amelioration of symptoms.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Scombroid-fish poisoning is associated with urinary excretion of histamine in quantities far exceeding those required to produce toxicity.
 The histamine is most likely derived from the spoiled fish.
 These results identify histamine as the toxin responsible for scombroid-fish poisoning.

622,"The pathology of nonpalpable breast cancer.
 A principal goal of mammographic screening is the early detection of breast cancer.
 We reviewed records of 125 women who were referred because of nonpalpable, suspicious abnormalities on mammogram, which subsequently proved to be cancer, requiring mammographic localization biopsy and subsequent surgery for therapy.
 We found that 72 (57.6%) had invasive tumors, 15 (12%) showed evidence of microinvasion and 38 (30.4%) were noninvasive.
 A total of 115 patients had lymphadenectomy as part of their definitive surgery.
 Nine (12.7%) of the patients with infiltrating tumors had between one and 10 malignant nodes on histologic section.
 None of the patients with noninvasive or microinvasive tumors were found to have involved nodes.
 The mammographic abnormalities which led to biopsy in our series were: calcifications in 74 (59.2%) patients, mass lesions in 39 (31.2%), mass lesions with calcifications in 11 (8.8%), and asymmetry in one (0.8%).
 Of the nine patients with nodal metastases, seven (77.8%) had a mass with or without calcifications as the indication for biopsy.
 Increasing tumor size was found to correlate with invasive tumors on histopathologic examination and the incidence of lymph node metastases.
 Thirty-seven (54.4%) of the patients with infiltrating tumors had a tumor size greater than 1 cm.
 Further, seven (77.8%) of the nine lymph node positive patients had tumors between 1 and 3 cm in size.
 Of note, however, is that two (22.2%) patients with microscopic tumors had involved nodes.
 The 4-year actuarial survival in patients with infiltrating tumors was 85.2 per cent, while that for patients with noninvasive or microinvasive tumors was 100 per cent (median follow-up of 20 months).

623,"Watch and wait after careful surgical treatment and staging in well-differentiated early ovarian cancer.
 Patients with well-differentiated epithelial ovarian cancer Stages Ia, Ib, Ic, and IIa (FIGO 1976) were observed after surgical treatment without adjuvant therapy.
 Careful surgical staging was required, and the extent of the staging procedure was assessed in each individual patient.
 There were 107 patients entered in the study by nine Dutch oncology centers.
 Of these 107, 21 did not fulfill all of the inlet criteria of the study and were excluded.
 Central pathologic review was performed in the remaining 86 cases, revealing that there was borderline tumor in seven patients, moderately or poorly differentiated tumor in nine patients, and tumor of nonepithelial histologic cell type in one patient.
 In two cases, no material for histologic review was available.
 After exclusion of these 19 cases, 67 patients were further analyzed.
 None of these 67 patients was lost during the follow-up period that ranged from 19 to 99 months (mean, 50 months).
 Tumor recurrence was found in four patients after 11, 25, 34, and 34 months of follow-up, all of whom died shortly after diagnosis of the recurrence without satisfactory response to secondary treatment.
 For the patients who underwent the most extensive staging procedure, disease-free 5-year survival was 100%.
 For the patients who were inaccurately staged, disease-free 5-year survival was 88%.
 It was concluded that well-differentiated early stage (Ia-IIa) ovarian cancer carries an excellent prognosis after surgical treatment and complete surgical staging, with the possible exception of patients with Stage Ic disease with malignant peritoneal washings.
 Furthermore, it was considered that the application of more objective and consistent ways of assessing tumor grade should be encouraged.
 Surgical staging should be regarded as the golden standard in defining subsets of low-risk patients and should be included and clearly defined in future trials on early ovarian cancer.

624,"Acquired cisplatin resistance in human ovarian cancer cells is associated with enhanced repair of cisplatin-DNA lesions and reduced drug accumulation.
 Studies were undertaken to investigate acquired resistance to cisplatin in human ovarian cancer cells.
 The cell lines A2780 and A2780/CP70 were studied to assess their respective characteristics of drug accumulation and efflux, cytosolic inactivation of drug, and DNA repair.
 All experiments were performed using 1-h drug exposures.
 The A2780/CP70 cell line was 13-fold more resistant to cisplatin than A2780 cells.
 When studied at their respective IC50 doses, drug accumulation rates were similar for the two cell lines.
 However, the resistant cell line was twofold more efficient at effluxing drug, which was associated with reduced total drug accumulation for equivalent micromolar drug exposures.
 At equivalent levels of total cellular drug accumulation, the two cell lines formed the same levels of cisplatin-DNA damage, suggesting that cytosolic inactivation of drug does not contribute to the differential in resistance between these cell lines.
 Resistant cells were also twofold more efficient at repairing cisplatin-DNA lesions in cellular DNA and in transfected plasmid DNA.
 We conclude that in these paired cell lines, alterations in drug uptake/efflux and in DNA repair are the major contributing factors to acquired resistance to cisplatin.

 In an effort to quantify the risk for late progression in burst fractures, the sagittal index (SI) was defined to help to assess the segmental deformity at the level of the fracture.
 The SI is a measurement of the kyphotic segmental deformity corrected for the normal sagittal contour at the level of the deformed segment.
 A prospective study was devised in 1986 for burst fracture treatment.
 Complete data were available on 35 patients (22 males, 13 females), with an average follow-up of 27 months.
 SI was greater than 15 degrees in the first group, the members of which were treated surgically.
 The technique is described.
 SI was less than 15 degrees in the third group, the members of which were treated conservatively.
 The second control group included patients with SI greater than 15 degrees but who were not treated according to the authors protocol for independent reasons.
 The results suggest that SI is a useful criteria to assess deformity and predict progression of segmental kyphosis.

 In our initial experience with 82 patients, laparoscopic cholecystectomy has shown numerous advantages over open cholecystectomy.
 Both intraoperative blood loss and postoperative need for pain medication have been minimal.
 Most patients were discharged within 24 to 36 hours and resumed normal activities within 3 to 5 days.
 The aesthetic aspect is also an obvious advantage, since the laparoscopic procedure avoids disfiguring abdominal scars.
 Previous abdominal surgery is not a contraindication to attempting this procedure.

628,"Insulinomas: localization with selective intraarterial injection of calcium.
 To facilitate the noninvasive preoperative localization of islet cell tumors less than 15 mm in diameter, the authors examined the use of calcium as an insulin secretagogue in an arterial stimulation venous sampling (ASVS) technique.
 In four patients with episodic hypoglycemia, calcium gluconate (0.01-0.025 mEq Ca2+/kg) was injected directly into branches of the celiac plexus (gastroduodenal, splenic, and hepatic arteries) and the superior mesenteric artery.
 In all patients, serum levels of insulin rose abruptly in blood samples taken from the right hepatic vein 30 and 60 seconds after the infusion of calcium into the artery supplying the tumor; injection into an artery not supplying the tumor did not result in a similar rise.
 Accurate localization of the insulinomas was verified at surgery in three patients.
 In the fourth patient, who did not undergo surgery, arteriographic results were positive for insulinoma at the predicted site.
 On the basis of these results, the authors believe noninvasive ASVS may replace invasive portal venous sampling as the most effective method for the localization of occult insulinomas.

 The authors of this study hypothesized that percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of a stenosis at the ostium of a branch vessel, whether isolated or associated with a bifurcation stenosis, was associated with reduced procedural success and increased in-hospital complications.
 One hundred six patients with 119 ostial branch stenoses were compared with 1,168 patients who underwent angioplasty of nonostial branch stenoses.
 An ostial branch stenosis was defined as a stenosis in the proximal 3 mm of a major branch vessel (diagonal [n = 58], posterior descending [n = 21], obtuse marginal [n = 34] and intermediate [n = 6]).
 The ostial branch stenosis was isolated in 61% of the patients and associated with a bifurcation stenosis in 39%.
 Despite a balloon to artery ratio of 1.05:1, angiographic success was 74% of ostial branch stenoses versus 91% of nonostial stenoses (p less than 0.01).
 Furthermore, angioplasty of ostial branch stenoses resulted in a complication rate of 13 versus 5% for angioplasty of nonostial branch stenoses (p less than 0.01).
 Therefore, angioplasty of ostial branch stenoses results in decreased procedural success and significant residual stenosis despite adequate balloon sizing, suggesting arterial elastic recoil and a significant increase in complications.

 Olfactory bulb kindling rates were studied in two inbred strains of genetically seizure-prone mice (DBA/2 and El) and in three non-epileptic inbred strains [C57BL/6 (B6), ddY, and C3H/He (C3H)].
 None of the DBA/2 mice had been stimulated to seizure before or during the kindling and all mice were studied at 4-6 weeks of age, before development of spontaneous or movement-induced seizure activity in the El strain.
 The audiogenically seizure-susceptible DBA/2 mice required the fewest number of stimulations to reach stage 5 seizure (mean +/- SE = 4.0 +/- 0.6).
 The nonepileptic C3H mice required the most stimulations to reach stage 5 seizures (22.6 +/- 1.4).
 Kindling rates for B6 (9.6 +/- 0.6), El (14.8 +/- 1.1), and ddY (18.5 +/- 1.0) strains were intermediate, and the kindling rate for each strain was significantly different from that of the other strains.
 These findings show that the seizure-susceptible El mouse kindles more rapidly than the genetically similar but nonepileptic ddY control and suggest that an inherited seizure susceptibility accelerates the kindling rate.
 Nonepileptic B6 mice kindled more rapidly than El mice, however, suggesting that genetic factors other than those that influence seizure susceptibility are of primary importance in the determination of the kindling rate.

633,"Interstitial chemotherapy with drug polymer implants for the treatment of recurrent gliomas.
 Malignant gliomas have been difficult to treat with chemotherapy.
 The most effective agent, BCNU (carmustine), has considerable systemic toxicity and a short half-life in serum.
 To obviate these problems, a method has been developed for the local sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents by their incorporation into biodegradable polymers.
 Implantation of the drug-impregnated polymer at the tumor site allows prolonged local exposure with minimal systemic exposure.
 In this Phase I-II study, 21 patients with recurrent malignant glioma were treated with BCNU released interstitially by means of a polyanhydride biodegradable polymer implant.
 Up to eight polymer wafers were placed in the resection cavity intraoperatively, upon completion of tumor debulking.
 The polymer releases the therapeutic drug for approximately 3 weeks.
 Three increasing concentrations of BCNU were studied; the treatment was well tolerated at all three levels.
 There were no adverse reactions to the BCNU wafer treatment itself.
 The average survival period after reoperation was 65 weeks for the first dose group, 64 weeks for the second dose group, and 32 weeks for the highest dose group.
 The overall mean survival time was 48 weeks from reoperation and 94 weeks from the original operation.
 The overall median survival times were 46 weeks postimplant and 87 weeks from initial surgery.
 Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year from the time of their initial diagnosis and eight (38%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year after intracranial implantation of the polymer.
 Frequent hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis tests did not reveal any systemic effect from this interstitial chemotherapy.
 Since the therapy is well tolerated and safe, a placebo-controlled clinical trial has been started.
 The trial will measure the effect of the second treatment dose on survival of patients with recurrent malignant glioma.

 Nuclei of acinar cells from normal pancreas, adenomas, and three carcinomas in situ had normal diploid DNA content as determined by flow cytometry.
 One of two primary carcinomas had a hypodiploid DNA content.
 Two of three transplantable carcinomas were aneuploid with a DNA content in the tetraploid range.
 Explants from nodules and adenomas failed to grow in soft agar, whereas several carcinomas were positive in this assay.
 A primary carcinoma was serially transplanted, but transplantation of nodules or adenomas failed.
 Transfection of DNA from carcinomas in situ yielded a higher frequency of NIH 3T3 transformants than DNA from adenomas.

 Ers in NMD patients was 79 percent higher than in the C subjects.
 While TI, TT, and VT in NMD were approximately half the corresponding C values, P.01 was 66 percent greater than in the C subjects (both p less than 0.001).
 NMD PImax and PEmax ranged from 37 to 52 percent of corresponding C values, respectively.

 In spite of muscle weakness, central drive in patients with NMD is not decreased, and in fact, is often increased.
 VE is not an accurate measure of central drive because of abnormal intrinsic respiratory mechanics and the effects of conscious responses or reflexes.

 Continuous interpleural analgesia provided by 4 hourly injections of 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5% with adrenaline 5 micrograms/ml was compared with placebo in a randomised, double-blind study after cholecystectomy.
 All patients self-administered intravenous morphine using a patient-controlled analgesia device.
 There was a highly significant difference in mean morphine consumption between the groups (72 mg as compared with 22 mg).
 Visual analogue pain scores tended to be lower in the bupivacaine group throughout and this was significant at 2 hours.
 Respiratory function measurements were not significantly different between the groups.
 The mean peak venous plasma bupivacaine concentration after the sixth dose was 3.03 micrograms/ml and no symptoms suggestive of local anaesthetic toxicity occurred.
 It is concluded that this regimen can provide effective and continuous analgesia after cholecystectomy and that combined administration of interpleural bupivacaine and systemic morphine is more effective than morphine alone in the immediate postoperative period.
 The doses of bupivacaine required for optimal use of the technique lead to significant total plasma bupivacaine concentrations within 24 hours.

 Women in the study were observed for up to 16 years after the baseline survey in 1971 to 1975.
 By 1987 631 women had died; 347 of these deaths were due to cardiovascular disease.

 After adjusting for known cardiovascular disease risk factors (smoking, cholesterol, body mass index, blood pressure, previous myocardial infarction, history of diabetes, age) and education, the use of postmenopausal hormones was associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease (relative risk, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.90).
 The same protective effect provided by postmenopausal hormone therapy was seen in women who experienced natural menopause (relative risk, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.06).

643,"Cardiac rehabilitation after coronary artery bypass grafting: effects on exercise performance and risk factors.
 After coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 49 nonselected patients followed a cardiac rehabilitation program that included medical follow-up and physical training, both in outpatient groups and on an individual basis at home.
 The effect of the program on exercise test variables, coronary risk factors, and medication one year after surgery was compared to a nonexercised control group (n = 98).
 The study group showed less increase in the rate-pressure product, indicating a favorable effect on myocardial oxygen consumption (0.7 +/- 5.4 vs 2.8 +/- 5.6, p less than .05); a lower frequency of angina at exercise testing (6% vs 18%, p less than .01); a reduction in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (9/4mmHg, p less than .01); fewer smokers (6% vs 17%, p less than .05); and fewer patients taking long-acting nitrates (0% vs 10.2%, p less than .05).
 It is suggested, therefore, that an organized cardiac rehabilitation program may be advantageous after CABG.

 Six patients (5 index cases and 1 sib) with a congenital motor and sensory neuropathy are described.
 The clinical, genetic and electrophysiological features resembled Dejerine-Sottas disease or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) type III.
 Sural nerve biopsy of 5 patients revealed segmental demyelination and remyelination with hypertrophic changes, although onion bulbs were not as ubiquitous as in classical HMSN type III.
 A striking discriminating feature from HMSN type III was an abundance of focal myelin thickenings (tomacula) present in nearly all teased fibres.
 Possible pathogenic implications are discussed.
 These cases corroborate the heterogeneity of congenital motor and sensory neuropathies.

645,"Telephone use to elicit voice or speech in brain injured subjects.
 The initiation of speech is often delayed in the early stages of recovery from a serious brain injury.
 We have found a high percentage of patients with both speech and swallowing problems.
 This makes bedside assessment of swallowing safety difficult because one cannot listen for the sound of aspirated material on the vocal cords when a patient is at high risk for silent aspiration and is often unable to cooperate with a videofluoroscopic study.
 The use of the telephone has been described several times for aphasia treatment, but not to elicit speech or assess swallowing safety early after brain injury.
 This study, therefore, recruited subjects who had brain injuries and (1) were referred early for swallowing and other evaluations, (2) were out of coma and able to follow some commands, and (3) did not initiate voice or speak when asked to.
 Subjects were asked three questions under two different conditions: face to face and after ringing the telephone from another room.
 The results were recorded on videotape and analyzed by another investigator for quantifiable differences.
 Six of the seven subjects responded better with the telephone stimulus than without.
 This technique may elicit voice or speech early after brain injury in some patients and may be useful in bedside assessment of swallowing safety.
 It may also serve as an example of appropriate stimulation of brain injured subjects coming out of coma.

 The snare loop is at right angles to the cable and comes in five sizes (5, 10, 15, 25, and 35 mm); its radiographic visualization is enhanced by gold-plated tungsten coils.
 This snare was used to retrieve wire and catheter fragments introduced into the thoracic vasculature of four dogs.
 Eleven of 13 attempts were successful.
 Three attempts to retrieve intravascular foreign bodies were successful in two patients; in one of these patients, a 10-mm snare was used to remove a fractured end of a ventriculoatrial shunt tube from the left pulmonary artery.
 In three other patients, four ureteral stents were successfully removed under fluoroscopic guidance.
 All retrievals were performed through a vascular sheath and with standard techniques and angiographic equipment.

 Large soft-tissue defects following close-range shotgun blasts remain a major technical challenge to trauma surgeons.
 During the period 1980 through 1988, 43 patients who survived greater than 48 hours following this injury were managed in our center.
 The locations of their soft-tissue defects were: extremity, 22; abdomen/chest, 18; and head/neck, three.
 All patients underwent immediate surgical exploration and wide debridement of all devitalized tissue along with repair of associated injuries.
 Management included mandatory frequent dressing changes, debridement, irrigation in the operating room, and the perioperative administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
 Four patients whose abdominal wall defects could not be initially closed had temporary placement of rayon cloth to prevent evisceration.
 Overall, four patients underwent delayed primary closure, eight were covered with split-thickness skin grafts, nine had closure with myocutaneous flaps, and 19 closed by secondary intent.
 Two patients, who were transferred to us following initial management, developed wound sepsis due to inadequate debridement and both eventually required amputation as did one patient who developed early myonecrosis following lengthy arterial repair.
 Frequent operative dressing changes, adequate debridement, and irrigation minimize sepsis following close-range shotgun blasts and should be the treatment of choice for this devastating injury.
 Techniques of wound closure need to be individualized to the particular situation.

650,"Molecular genetic basis of maple syrup urine disease in a family with two defective alleles for branched chain acyltransferase and localization of the gene to human chromosome 1.
 Maple syrup urine disease in humans results from inherited defects in branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial multienzyme complex.
 A variety of genetic changes may produce this phenotype by affecting the function of any of the three complex-specific subunits.
 The varied clinical expression observed in patients may be partially explained by the defects in the involved subunit.
 Here we report localization of the gene for the branched chain acyltransferase component of the complex to human chromosome 1 and describe a proband who is a compound heterozygote at this locus.
 One allele, inherited from the father, produces transcripts with 124 nucleotides deleted from the coding region.
 The deletion is not found in the branched chain acyltransferase gene, implying that the deleted transcripts arise by an error in transcript processing.
 Cells from the patient's mother contain 50% of the normal amount of mRNA for the subunit, and the proband has inherited this nonexpressing allele from her.
 As a result, the proband produces no acyltransferase protein and therefore has greatly impaired complex activity.
 A phenotypically normal sibling is shown to be genetically similar to the mother having inherited the mother's nonexpressing allele and the father's normal allele.

 Between January 1986 and September 1988, 75 patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] Stages IB-III) received three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), including cisplatin, bleomycin, and methotrexate (PBM).
 Fifteen percent of patients achieved a complete response (CR) and 68% a partial response (PR).
 Pretreatment characteristics were analyzed for response to NAC.
 Significantly lower response rates were found in patients with tumor size more than 5 cm in diameter and bilateral parametrial involvement to the pelvic side wall.
 None of the biological parameters studied was related to chemoresponsiveness.
 Patients achieving CR or PR had a significantly improved 3-year survival rate compared with those who did not respond.
 After NAC, radical surgery was possible in all responding patients.
 The median number of lymph nodes removed was 60.
 A lower than expected incidence of lymph node metastases was detected.
 None of the clinical and pathologic features considered was significantly correlated with the lymph node status.
 Twelve of the 62 operated patients had disease recurrence.
 Pathologic parametrial involvement and cervical infiltration equal to or deeper than 5 mm were found to be significant prognostic factors for recurrence.
 A 3-year, disease-free survival of 89%, 73%, and 43% for Stage IB-IIA, IIB, and III, respectively, was found.
 Among the operated patients these rates increased to 100%, 81%, and 66% for Stage IB-IIA, IIB, and III, respectively.

653,"Characterization of the effect of two 4-methyl piperidine derivatives of hemicholinium-3, A-4 and A-5, on choline transport.
 A-4 and A-5 are tertiary and N-methyl quaternary 4-methylpiperidine analogs of hemicholinium-3 (HC-3).
 Previous work in this laboratory has shown A-4 and A-5 to be inhibitors of the sodium-dependent, high affinity choline uptake system (SDHACU).
 Their effects on choline transport were characterized further using neuroblastoma 41A3 cells.
 These cells rapidly take up choline through two separate mechanisms: a SDHACU system and a sodium-independent, low affinity uptake system (SILACU).
 A-4, A-5 and HC-3 decreased 5 microM choline transport in a dose-dependent fashion.
 The compounds were unable to decrease choline transport at 250 microM choline suggesting that they are inactive with respect to SILACU.
 All three compounds significantly increased the Km but not the Vmax for the SDHACU system, suggesting a competitive mechanism of inhibition.
 Ki values ranged from 18 to 25 microM for A-4, 20 to 26 microM for A-5 and 68 to 75 microM for HC-3.
 Dose-response curves for inhibition of choline transport by A-5 and HC-3 were not changed by a 24-hr pre-exposure of the cells to each inhibitor.
 However, after a 24-hr pre-exposure to A-4, a significantly different dose-response curve was obtained compared to the dose-response curve for A-4 in untreated cells.
 After a 24-hr pre-exposure, a 4-hr recovery period was sufficient to remove the effect of each compound.
 These data suggest that A-4 and A-5, like HC-3, inhibit the SDHACU, competitively and reversibly.

654,"Value and limitations of Doppler pressure half-time in quantifying mitral stenosis: a comparison with micromanometer catheter recordings.
 The purpose of this study was to compare the Doppler and catheterization pressure half-time methods of estimating mitral valve area with valve areas obtained by the Gorlin equation in a group of patients with clinically significant mitral stenosis.
 Data were analyzed from 67 consecutive patients who were undergoing continuous-wave Doppler examination and catheterization with micromanometer catheters.
 Doppler pressure half-time was calculated as the interval between peak transmitral velocity and velocity divided by the square root of 2, as measured from the outer border of the spectral envelope.
 Doppler mitral valve area (MVA) was obtained with the equation: MVA = 220 divided by pressure half-time.
 For catheterization data, the pressure half-time was measured directly from simultaneously recorded left ventricular and left atrial pressure (18 patients) or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (49 patients).
 The catheterization half-time was taken as the time required for the peak pressure gradient to fall to one half of the initial value.
 Calculations of the mitral valve area at catheterization were obtained by the Gorlin equation with pressure gradient and cardiac output determinations.
 Mitral valve area as determined by the Gorlin equation for all cases ranged from 0.4 to 2.0 (mean = 1.03 +/- 0.37) cm2.
 Linear regression analysis that compared cardiac catheterization and Doppler half-times yielded r = 0.68.
 For the subgroup of patients with sinus rhythm, the correlation improved to r = 0.76.

 One of them had a 5 x 2.5 cm aneurysmal dilatation, where three secondary branches arose.
 These venous channels were dilated and tortuous.
 The longest secondary branch was 133 cm in length and 1.2 cm in mean diameter and led into the placenta.
 Multiple, severely coiled or straight small branches arising from these vessels were also observed as vascular tangles.
 Some of these smaller vessels also led into the placenta.
 All abnormal vessels were veins.

 Vimentin expression in tumors from 83 node-negative and 112 node-positive patients with infiltrative ductal not otherwise specified (NOS) breast carcinomas has been compared with 5-year survival.
 For node-negative, but not for node-positive patients, there was a significant inverse relation between vimentin expression and survival.
 Five-year survival of node-negative patients with vimentin-positive tumors was significantly worse compared with vimentin-negative tumors (P less than 0.0001).
 In the node-negative group, only 36% of patients with vimentin-positive tumors but 82% of patients with vimentin-negative tumors survived 5 years.
 Tumors of all eight node-negative patients with ductal NOS cancer who died in the first 27 months expressed vimentin.
 Multivariate analysis of the node-negative group showed a strong correlation of vimentin expression and overall survival, but weak and not significant correlation between histologic grade or size and overall survival at 5 years.
 Thus vimentin expression seems to be a strong indicator of poor prognosis in node-negative ductal NOS breast carcinomas.

657,"Downregulation of the platelet surface glycoprotein Ib-IX complex in whole blood stimulated by thrombin, adenosine diphosphate, or an in vivo wound.
 In washed platelet systems, thrombin has been demonstrated to downregulate the platelet surface expression of glycoprotein (GP) Ib and GPIX.
 In the present study, we addressed the question as to whether, in the more physiologic milieu of whole blood, downregulation of platelet surface GPIb and GPIX can be induced by thrombin, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and/or by an in vivo wound.
 Thrombin-induced downregulation of GPIb and GPIX on the surface of individual platelets in whole blood was demonstrated by the use of flow cytometry, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and, to inhibit fibrin polymerization, the peptide glycyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl-L-proline.
 Platelets were identified in whole blood by a GPIV-specific MoAb and exclusion of monocytes by light scattering properties.
 Flow cytometric analysis of whole blood emerging from a standardized bleeding-time wound established that downregulation of platelet surface GPIb and GPIX can occur in vivo.
 A GPIb-IX complex-specific antibody indicated that the GPIb and GPIX remaining on the surface of platelets activated in vivo or in vitro were fully complexed.
 Simultaneous analysis of individual platelets by two fluorophores demonstrated that thrombin-induced platelet surface exposure of GMP-140 (degranulation) was nearly complete at the time that downregulation of platelet surface GPIb-IX was initiated.
 However, degranulation was not a prerequisite because ADP downregulated platelet surface GPIb-IX without exposing GMP-140 on the platelet surface.
 Inhibitory effects of cytochalasins demonstrated that the activation-induced downregulation of both GPIX and GPIb are dependent on actin polymerization.
 In summary, downregulation of the platelet surface GPIb-IX complex occurs in whole blood stimulated by thrombin, ADP, or an in vivo wound, and is independent of alpha granule secretion.

 BACKGROUND.
 In both animal and epidemiologic studies, exposure to dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD) has been associated with an increased risk of cancer.
 METHODS.
 We conducted a retrospective cohort study of mortality among the 5172 workers at 12 plants in the United States that produced chemicals contaminated with TCDD.
 Occupational exposure was documented by reviewing job descriptions and by measuring TCDD in serum from a sample of 253 workers.
 Causes of death were taken from death certificates.
 RESULTS.
 Mortality from several cancers previously associated with TCDD (stomach, liver, and nasal cancers, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) was not significantly elevated in this cohort.
 Mortality from soft-tissue sarcoma was increased, but not significantly (4 deaths; standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 338; 95 percent confidence interval, 92 to 865).
 In the subcohort of 1520 workers with greater than or equal to 1 year of exposure and greater than or equal to 20 years of latency, however, mortality was significantly increased for soft-tissue sarcoma (3 deaths; SMR, 922; 95 percent confidence interval, 190 to 2695) and for cancers of the respiratory system (SMR, 142; 95 percent confidence interval, 103 to 192).
 Mortality from all cancers combined was slightly but significantly elevated in the overall cohort (SMR, 115; 95 percent confidence interval, 102 to 130) and was higher in the subcohort with greater than or equal to 1 year of exposure and greater than or equal to 20 years of latency (SMR, 146; 95 percent confidence interval, 121 to 176).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 This study of mortality among workers with occupational exposure to TCDD does not confirm the high relative risks reported for many cancers in previous studies.
 Conclusions about an increase in the risk of soft-tissue sarcoma are limited by small numbers and misclassification on death certificates.
 Excess mortality from all cancers combined, cancers of the respiratory tract, and soft-tissue sarcoma may result from exposure to TCDD, although we cannot exclude the possible contribution of factors such as smoking and occupational exposure to other chemicals.

 Digitalis toxicity continues to be a problem for pediatric patients undergoing therapy with cardiac glycosides for heart failure or arrhythmias, as well as in accidental ingestions.
 In this article the previous use of digoxin-specific antibody Fab fragments to treat digitalis overdose or intoxication in children is reviewed.
 The case reports cited in the medical literature and the 57 pediatric cases gathered as a result of the multicenter clinical trial and postmarketing surveillance study reported here indicate that digoxin-specific antibody Fab fragments are effective in ameliorating signs of digitalis poisoning in children.
 Not only can Fab fragments rapidly eradicate potentially life-threatening arrhythmias and conduction defects, but they are also effective in treating hyperkalemia and other noncardiac manifestations of digitalis toxicity.
 In the small samples of patients studied to date, complications have been minimal and no allergic reactions to digoxin-specific Fab fragments have been observed.
 Recommendations for the management of digitalis intoxication in children are outlined.

 From July 1986 to December 1989, 33 patients (29 men, 4 women) with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent 45 operations.
 Twenty-eight patients had an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, and five patients had a thoracoabdominal aneurysm.
 The abdominal aortic aneurysm ranged in transverse diameter from 3.0 to 8.5 cm (average 5.6 cm).
 Twenty-seven patients underwent a single operation, and six patients had two or more (range of 1 to 6).
 Operations performed were abdominal (13); cardiothoracic (9); head/neck (2); other vascular (11); urologic (7); amputation (2); breast (1).
 General anesthesia was used in 29 procedures, spinal/epidural in 6, and regional/local in 10.
 One postoperative death occurred from cardiopulmonary failure.
 One patient died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at 20 days after coronary artery bypass (1/33 patients [3%]; 1/45 operations [2%]).
 Fourteen patients had repair of their abdominal aortic aneurysm at a later date, an average of 18 weeks after operation.
 Four patients had abdominal aortic aneurysm considered too small to warrant resection (average 3.6 cm).
 Four patients were considered at excessive risk for elective repair.

 Recent data have generated some interest in technetium-99m-(99mTc) glucaric acid as an in vivo viability marker.
 We studied 99mTc-glucaric acid retention in canine models of myocardial ischemia (20-min occlusion of the LAD/40-min reperfusion), acute myocardial infarction (MI) (90-min LAD occlusion/3-hr reperfusion), and chronic MI (90-min occlusion and either 48-hr or 10-day reperfusion).
 Regional myocardial blood flow was measured by radiolabeled microspheres.
 No preferential uptake of glucaric acid was observed in ischemic but viable myocardium.
 The compound showed high affinity for necrotic myocardial tissue for several days following injury.
 The preferential uptake in infarcted tissue disappeared by 10 days following injury.
 This study shows that 99mTc-glucaric acid acts exclusively as a marker of necrosis in canine models of MI.

 There is now a better understanding of the natural history of colorectal cancer, which has provided a basis for intervention to influence outcome.
 The possible interventions include earlier detection of colorectal cancer, removal of premalignant adenomas, demonstration of the mucosal field defect that precedes neoplasia to evaluate baseline risk and its change with dietary modification, and identification of inherited and dietary risk factors.
 Five controlled trials evaluating early detection of colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood testing have enrolled more than 309,000 patients.
 Early stage cancers with improved survival has been observed, but data on mortality reduction have not as yet been reported.
 Studies of patients with adenomas have demonstrated high synchronous and metachronous rates as a basis for complete colon evaluation initially and a surveillance follow-up program.

 Esophageal ultrasound allows the esophageal wall to be viewed as five discrete layers.
 Lymph nodes are easily identified, and their size, shape, margin, and internal structure can be assessed.
 This provides an alternative method of preoperative (clinical) evaluation of the primary tumor [T] and the regional lymph nodes [N] of patients with carcinoma of the esophagus.
 Esophageal ultrasound was attempted in the clinical staging of 28 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus.
 Six patients (21%) were not assessed because of the inability to pass the esophageal ultrasound probe through the malignant stricture.
 The staging system for carcinoma of the esophagus developed by the International Union Against Cancer and the American Joint Committee on Cancer was used.
 Twenty-two patients had the true T determined by pathologic review of the resected esophagus.
 Esophageal ultrasound correctly identified T in 13 patients (59% accuracy).
 In four patients (18%) the disease was overstaged by esophageal ultrasound; all these patients had early T1 tumors confined to the submucosa.
 In five patients (23%) the disease was understaged by esophageal ultrasound; all of these patients had advanced tumors (four T3 and one T4) that invaded beyond the esophageal wall.
 Seven of the nine incorrect esophageal ultrasound determinations were called T2 (three T1, three T3, one T4), which suggests that the borders of the muscularis propria require careful attention when evaluated by esophageal ultrasound.
 Twenty patients had the true N determined by pathologic review of the resected specimen.
 Esophageal ultrasound correctly identified N in 14 patients (70% accuracy).
 Three patients were falsely identified as having N1 disease and three were falsely identified as having N0 disease.
 The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for N assessment by esophageal ultrasound were 70%.

668,"A simplified diagnostic approach to pheochromocytoma. A review of the literature and report of one institution's experience.
 Pheochromocytoma is an unusual but potentially devastating tumor.
 Although a high index of suspicion is necessary, the likelihood of a pheochromocytoma is lower in the absence of the typical symptoms and findings.
 Nonetheless, screening must be broadened to include patients with a lower risk of the disease, such as those with resistant or labile hypertension who are minimally symptomatic.
 Extensive diagnostic evaluations should be reserved for those whose clinical or laboratory findings are more suggestive.
 Symptoms in a group of patients in whom a pheochromocytoma was seriously considered but excluded overlap symptoms in patients with a pheochromocytoma.
 Certain symptoms are useful: flushing to suggest a non-pheochromocytoma illness; visual symptoms, flank pain, and pallor to suggest that a pheochromocytoma is more likely.
 Combinations of symptoms can be of value: 2 or more symptoms from the triad of headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis were present in the majority of pheochromocytoma patients, but in a smaller number of non-pheochromocytoma patients.
 The presence of the entire triad is more specific, but less sensitive.
 New hypertension, or hypertension associated with unexplained orthostatic hypotension, are suggestive of an underlying pheochromocytoma.
 Twenty-four-hour urine studies are consistently abnormal in patients with a pheochromocytoma, but are also elevated in a significant proportion of non-pheochromocytoma patients.
 Values greater then 1.5-2-fold above the upper limit of normal are very suggestive that a pheochromocytoma is present, and warrant a more intensive subsequent evaluation.
 Imaging studies are reliable in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, and can help to confirm or exclude the disease.
 Patients with a higher clinical likelihood and any elevated urinary testing, or with a lower clinical likelihood and persistently and/or significantly elevated urinary testing, should have imaging studies performed.
 This combination of clinical screening, 24-hour urinary testing, and imaging studies is a useful and reliable approach to patients suspected of harboring a pheochromocytoma.

669,"Splenectomy for the massively enlarged spleen.
 The experience at the National Cancer Institute from 1955 to 1988 with 46 cases of splenectomy for massive splenomegaly (greater than or equal to 1,500 grams) was reviewed to assess the indications, pathology, operative, and postoperative course for this procedure.
 The median age was 51 years.
 Thirty-one splenectomies (67.4%) were performed for malignancy (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 11; chronic myelogenous leukemia, 10; lymphoma, 9; hairy cell leukemia, 1), 11 for myeloid metaplasia, and four for other nonmalignant conditions.
 Indications for splenectomy included hypersplenism (32 patients), symptoms (6), diagnosis (3), and splenic rupture (3).
 A midline incision (30 patients) was most commonly used.
 Median operative time was 2 hours, 50 minutes.
 Median operative blood loss was 1,300 ml (range, 100 ml-60 units).
 The splenic artery was ligated initially in 16 patients (34.8%) but did not correlate with blood loss or operating time.
 The median splenic weight was 2,030 grams (range, 1500-5320 gm).
 The postoperative complication rate was 39.1 per cent (21 complications in 18 patients).
 This included infection in 10 patients, bleeding in six patients.
 Six patients required reoperation (bleeding, 4; abscess, 1; small bowel obstruction, 1 patient).
 The 30-day operative mortality was 19.6 per cent (9 patients).
 Excluding operative deaths, 35 patients were available for follow-up evaluation.
 Twenty-nine patients had improvement in parameters for which splenectomy was indicated.
 Six patients had no change in their course after splenectomy.
 These findings indicate that many patients with massive splenomegaly benefit from splenectomy, however, the procedure is associated with a high risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality.

670,"Monoclonal antibody-purged autologous bone marrow transplantation therapy for multiple myeloma.
 Eleven patients with plasma cell dyscrasias underwent high-dose chemoradiotherapy and anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody (MoAb)-treated autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT).
 The majority of patients had advanced Durie-Salmon stage myeloma at diagnosis, all were pretreated with chemotherapy, and six had received prior radiotherapy.
 At the time of ABMT, all patients demonstrated good performance status with Karnofsky score of 80% or greater and had less than 10% marrow tumor cells.
 Eight patients had residual monoclonal marrow plasma cells and 10 patients had paraprotein.
 Following high-dose melphalan and total body irradiation (TBI) there were seven complete responses, three partial responses, and one toxic death.
 Granulocytes greater than 500/mm3 were noted at a median of 21 (range 12 to 46) days posttransplant (PT) and untransfused platelets greater than 20,000/mm3 were noted at a median of 23 (12 to 53) days PT in 10 of the 11 patients.
 Natural killer cells and cytotoxic/suppressor T cells predominated early PT, with return of B cells at 3 months PT and normalization of T4:T8 ratio at 1 year PT.
 Less than 5% polyclonal marrow plasma cells were noted in all patients after transplant.
 Three of the seven complete responders have had return of paraprotein, two with myeloma, and have subsequently responded to alpha 2 interferon therapy.
 Eight patients are alive at 18.9 (8.9 to 43.1) months PT and four remain disease-free at 12.3, 17.5, 18.9, and 29 months PT.
 This preliminary study confirms that high-dose melphalan and TBI can achieve high response rates without unexpected toxicity in patients who have sensitive disease, and that MoAb-based purging techniques do not inhibit engraftment.
 Although the follow-up is short- and long-term outcome to be determined, relapses post-ABMT in these heavily pretreated patients suggest that ABMT or alternative treatment strategies should be evaluated earlier in the disease course.

671,"Psychosocial adjustment in women with breast cancer.
 There is a plethora of studies investigating psychosocial adjustment in women with breast cancer, its correlates, clinical course, and prognosis.
 These studies have been conducted with varying degrees of methodologic rigor.
 An assessment has been made of the quality of this existing evidence to identify from the best evidence the factors which predict the adjustment status of women with breast cancer.
 Studies have been reviewed, using methodologic standards for the critical appraisal of studies on prognosis, developed by Sackett and colleagues in the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada).
 Few of the studies investigating psychosocial adjustment of women with breast cancer meet all of the criteria for reviewing studies of clinical course and prognosis.
 This review focuses the direction and methodologic rigor required in future investigations.
 In particular, studies are needed that employ prospective designs and that deliberately measure or control for the extraneous prognostic variables that may affect adjustment.
 Future investigations need to incorporate adequate precision in measurement so that measures of the psychosocial variables are objective, reliable, and valid.

672,"Mechanisms of vein graft atherosclerosis: LDL metabolism and endothelial actin reorganization.
 We have explored the effect of arterial hemodynamics on endothelial cell morphology and low-density lipoprotein metabolism in human saphenous vein segments harvested from tissue donors.
 An arterial pulsatile perfusion system was used to impose physiologic pressures and flows for 20 hours on saphenous vein and companion (control) femoral artery segments.
 A venous perfusion apparatus was also employed for the perfusion of a second (control) saphenous vein segment for the same period of time.
 Calculations of fluid shearing and wall tensile stresses were performed and related to induced changes in endothelial cell geometry and cytoskeletal actin organization and the incorporation, degradation, and localization of intact low-density lipoprotein within the vessel wall.
 Our results indicate that, compared with native arteries and veins, a 20-hour exposure of test saphenous veins to arterial hemodynamics induced (1) a significant increase in endothelial cell luminal surface area and perimeter independent of alignment with flow, (2) disassembly of the dense peripheral band of actin with a concomitant assembly of stress fibers, and (3) a two- to fourfold elevation in the undegraded low-density lipoprotein content, localized primarily within the subendothelial intima.
 Although the exact mechanisms underlying these results are uncertain, the focal accumulation of intramural low-density lipoprotein may be related to the loss of normal barrier function during endothelial cell enlargement, which is accompanied by transient cytoskeletal reorganization during the adaptation to arterial flow.

674,"Molecular characterization of erythrocyte glycophorin C variants.
 Human erythrocyte glycophorin C plays a functionally important role in maintaining erythrocyte shape and regulating membrane mechanical stability.
 Immunochemical and serologic studies have identified a number of glycophorin C variants that include the Yus, Gerbich, and Webb phenotypes.
 We report here the molecular characterization of these variants.
 Amplification of glycophorin C mRNA from the Yus phenotype, using two oligonucleotide primers that span the coding domain, generated a 338-bp fragment compared with a 395-bp fragment generated by amplification of normal glycophorin C mRNA.
 Sequencing of the mutant 338-bp fragment identified a 57-bp deletion that corresponds to exon 2 of the glycophorin C gene.
 Similar analysis showed deletion of 84-bp exon 3 in the Gerbich phenotype.
 In contrast to the generation of shorter than normal DNA fragments from mRNA amplification in the Yus and Gerbich phenotypes, amplification of mRNA from the Webb phenotype generated a normal-sized fragment.
 Sequencing of this DNA fragment showed an A----G substitution at nucleotide 23 of the coding sequence, resulting in the substitution of asparagine by serine.
 This modification accounts for the altered glycosylation of glycophorin C seen in this phenotype.
 These results have enabled us to characterize glycophorin C variants in three different phenotypes that involve deletions of exons 2 and 3 of the glycophorin C gene, as well as a point mutation in exon 1 that results in altered glycosylation of this protein.

 Etoposide (VP16-213, NSC 141540) induces a complete response (CR) in 15% to 25% of previously treated patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) when used as a single agent.
 Etoposide has been used successfully in combination with cytarabine, daunorubicin, and amsacrine for salvage and consolidation therapies.
 Previously untreated ANLL patients 15 to 70 years of age were randomly assigned to cytarabine (100 mg/m2) on days 1 to 7 plus daunorubicin (50 mg/m2) on days 1 to 3 (7-3) or to the same drugs plus etoposide (75 mg/m2) on days 1 to 7 (7-3-7).
 Patients achieving a CR received two consolidation courses (5-2, attenuated 7-3 or 5-2-5).
 Among 264 eligible patients, there was a 56% CR rate with 7-3 therapy and a 59% CR rate with 7-3-7 therapy.
 Remission duration was significantly improved with 7-3-7 (median, 12 months with 7-3 and 18 months with 7-3-7; P = 0.01), but survival was not.
 Subset analysis in patients younger than 55 years of age revealed prolonged remission (median, 12 months with 7-3 and 27 months with 7-3-7; P = 0.01) and survival (median, 9 months with 7-3 and 17 months with 7-3-7; P = 0.04) with the 7-3-7 regimen.
 Hematologic toxicity was similar for both regimens during induction, but significantly more severe for 7-3-7 during consolidation therapy.
 Etoposide is active in ANLL and prolongs remission when used in induction therapy.

676,"Second primary cancer following Hodgkin's disease: updated results of an Italian multicentric study.
 The risk of second primary cancer (SPC) was evaluated in 947 patients treated for Hodgkin's disease (HD) during the period January 1969 to December 1979.
 The median follow-up of this series was 10.5 years (range, 9 to 19).
 Treatment categories included radiotherapy (RT) alone (115 patients, 12%), chemotherapy (CHT) alone (161 patients, 17%), combined RT plus CHT (381 patients, 40%), and salvage treatment for resistant or relapsing HD (290 patients, 30.6%).
 Fifty-six SPCs were observed, occurring between 1 and 17 years from initial treatment.
 Among these, secondary acute nonlymphoid leukemia (s-ANLL) was the most frequent SPC (23 cases).
 Secondary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (s-NHL) occurred in 5 patients, whereas a secondary solid tumor (s-ST) was observed in 28 patients.
 The calculated actuarial risk (+/- SE) of developing SPC was 5.0% (+/- 0.9%) and 23.1% (+/- 5.8%) at 10 and 19 years, respectively.
 Concerning treatment modalities and s-ANLL risk, no cases were observed in the radiotherapy group, whereas CHT plus RT and salvage groups showed the highest actuarial risk.
 This was, in fact, at 10 and 19 years, 3.1% (+/- 0.9%) and 8.1% (+/- 4.0%) in the former group, and 1.8% (+/- 1.0%) and 16% (+/- 9.0%) in the latter.
 A statistically significant difference was observed when the CHT plus RT group was compared with CHT and RT groups (P = .04).
 Concerning the relationships with chemotherapeutic regimens, 12 s-ANLL cases occurred in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) plus RT group, and only one case in the group receiving doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) plus RT.
 A statistically significant difference of s-ANLL actuarial risk was found comparing patients receiving MOPP plus RT to all other treatment groups (P = .04).
 With respect to s-ST, the actuarial risk at 10 and 19 years was 2.0% (+/- 0.6%) and 13.0% (+/- 3.8%), respectively.
 No significant differences were found among groups treated with different modalities.
 These data were confirmed by a multivariate analysis, which indicated treatment modality and age as independent variables for s-ANLL and s-ST development, respectively.
 Based on the prolonged follow-up analysis, the actuarial SPC risk at 10 years hereby reported should reflect the real SPC incidence in our series.

677,"Detection of loss of heterozygosity in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens by the polymerase chain reaction.
 A polymerase chain reaction-based procedure was used for the detection of DNA length polymorphisms generated by naturally occurring genetic deletions or insertions of known sequence.
 This method consists of a simple one-step assay that does not require any restriction enzyme analysis or Southern blot hybridization, allowing identification in ethidium bromide-stained gels.
 The procedure described here was used to detect loss of heterozygosity at various loci, including the Hbb beta-globin gene cluster, in chemically induced mouse skin tumors, using a variety of tissue preparations, including microdissection of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, short-term cultures, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting of epithelial populations.

678,"Sequencing in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in programming and controlling movement.
 Central programming deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) were studied in two reaction time (RT) experiments.
 In Experiment 1, PD patients and controls performed sequences of hand postures that varied in length, the number of different postures (repetitive vs heterogeneous), and the delay interval before movement.
 Before movement, the PD group planned repetitive movements like controls whereas for heterogeneous sequences RT increased less with sequence length for the PD group, implying less preprogramming.
 The interresponse time (IRT) data from repetitive sequences showed that the PD group had difficulty controlling movement such that IRTs were faster when sequences were longer, thus allowing more time to schedule the termination of the sequence during the course of movement.
 For heterogeneous sequences, the PD group made more errors and were slower than controls when changing hand postures, suggesting a deficit in switching between different responses.
 While RT decreased with a longer delay similarly for both groups, IRT1 continued to improve only for the PD group but similarly for both types of sequences, suggesting a deficit specific to programming the first response.
 In Experiment 2, subjects made decisions about the number of different hand postures contained within a sequence.
 PD patients' decision times improved more with a longer delay only for heterogeneous sequences, suggesting a problem in identifying the number of different hand postures.
 The results have implications for levels of motor dysfunction in PD which emphasize the influence of sequence length and complexity.

 Forty two (33%) of patients experienced side effects, which were predominantly neurotropic.
 In 28 (22%), the drug was withdrawn because of these side effects.
 The commonest side effects were drowsiness and behavioural change.
 The remaining 100 patients were followed for a mean of 30 weeks (range 12-75).
 Forty one of these patients showed a marked improvement in seizure frequency (a 50% or more reduction when compared with the pre-trial period), and nine (7%) were rendered seizure free.
 Apparent tolerance to the effects of the drug were noted in five patients.
 An exacerbation of seizures may occur if the drug is withdrawn too quickly.

 This study was undertaken to determine the appropriateness of celiotomy in 100 consecutive patients who underwent celiotomy solely because of positive diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) following blunt (B) or stab (S) abdominal trauma.
 A total of 32 (32%) patients had positive DPL by laboratory criteria: blunt trauma: greater than 100K RBC/mm3, greater than 500 WBC/mm3; stab trauma: greater than 50K RBC/mm3, greater than 250 WBC/mm3.
 DPL in 68 patients was positive by gross inspection; 18 of these 68 patients' DPL laboratory results returned after surgery and did not satisfy the laboratory definition of positive DPL.
 In all 61 per cent underwent therapeutic celiotomy (TC) and 39 per cent underwent nontherapeutic celiotomy (NTC).
 Grade I and II spleen and/or liver injuries led to 79 per cent of NTCs.
 Positive DPL, determined by gross inspection or by laboratory testing, has a very poor accuracy rate when evaluated in light of evolving beliefs that promote nonoperative therapy for grade I and II liver and spleen injuries.
 When positive DPL is the sole indication for celiotomy in patients with blunt or stab abdominal trauma, an unacceptably large number of NTCs will be performed.
 DPL should have a limited role in the evaluation of patients with abdominal trauma.

683,"Spontaneous alterations in coronary blood flow velocity before and after coronary angioplasty in patients with severe angina.
 Cyclic coronary artery flow variations with a spontaneous decline in coronary blood flow to very low levels have been documented in stenosed canine coronary arteries with endothelial injury.
 These flow variations are associated with transient platelet aggregation and dislodgment and the release of selected mediators, including thromboxane A2 and serotonin.
 However, cyclic or spontaneous flow variations have not been demonstrated in stenosed coronary arteries in humans.
 In this study, the hypothesis was tested that spontaneous coronary blood flow velocity variations occur in some patients with stenosed coronary arteries before or after coronary artery angioplasty.
 Thus, 13 patients with severe and limiting angina underwent intracoronary pulsed Doppler velocimetry of their dilated artery immediately before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, whereas 9 control patients underwent velocimetry of an angiographically normal coronary artery.
 A 3F catheter with a 20 MHz Doppler crystal was positioned to achieve a maximal stable signal, and the flow velocity signal was recorded continuously for 20 min.
 Spontaneous flow velocity variations (greater than or equal to 38% change in Doppler frequency shift with wide morphologic changes) were present in 3 of the 13 patients tested.
 Spontaneous flow velocity variations occurred before angioplasty in one patient, after angioplasty in another and both before and after angioplasty in a third.
 In addition, 2 of the 13 patients, 1 with spontaneous coronary artery flow velocity variations before angioplasty, had frank vasospasm in an adjacent area just distal to the area of coronary dilation immediately after balloon inflation.
 These data establish that spontaneous coronary artery flow velocity variations occur in some patients with severe and limiting angina before and after coronary angioplasty.
 These variations may be related to platelet aggregation or coronary vasoconstriction, or both, at sites of endothelial injury resulting from plaque fissuring or ulceration and endothelial and medial injury occurring during coronary angioplasty.

 The 82-residue amino-terminal sequences of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (TAg) and small tumor antigen (tAg) are identical.
 Genetic analysis of TAg lacking amino acids 1-82 revealed that it was transformation-defective, as revealed by the agar growth assay, except when introduced in the presence of tAg.
 Since the latter, alone, lacks overt transforming activity, it would appear that the function of the sequence common to TAg and tAg is necessary, but not sufficient, for TAg transforming activity and that tAg can provide that function or its equivalent in trans.
 Thus, tAg may, in part, be viewed as a ""portable"" copy of a TAg functional domain.

 rev-regulated expression of HIV-1 envelope proteins from a simian virus 40 late replacement vector was found to be dependent on the presence of a 5' splice site in the env mRNA in spite of the fact that this mRNA remains unspliced.
 When the 5' splice site upstream of the env open reading frame was deleted or mutated, expression of envelope protein was lost.
 RNA analysis of cells transfected with 5' splice-site mutants showed a dramatic reduction in the steady-state levels of env mRNA whether or not rev was present.
 Envelope expression could be restored in one of the 5' splice-site mutants by cotransfection with a plasmid expressing a suppressor U1 small nuclear RNA containing a compensatory mutation.

 The question as to whether reduction of plasma catecholamine concentration contributes to the beneficial effects of upper thoracic epidural anesthesia on survival during hemorrhagic shock was examined.
 Twenty-six dogs were anesthetized with halothane and nitrous oxide, and blood was withdrawn to reduce the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) to 40 mmHg.
 The 12 dogs in group A received both upper thoracic epidural anesthesia before the hemorrhage and intravenous infusion of epinephrine (450 ng.kg-1.min-1) and norepinephrine (150 ng.kg-1.min-1) during hemorrhage.
 The 14 dogs in group B received none of these.
 At 20 min after the start of the bleeding, plasma catecholamine concentrations were increased in both groups more than ten-fold.
 There were no significant intergroup differences with respect to these concentrations at any point during the experimental period.
 During the 100-min period of hemorrhage, 1 of the 12 animals in group A and 10 of the 14 in group B died.
 A significant difference in survival was seen between the two groups over the 100-min hypotensive period (P less than 0.01 by the generalized Wilcoxon test).
 These results suggest that the survival benefit of upper thoracic epidural anesthesia cannot be explained simply by differences in the level of catecholamines in the plasma, and that perhaps differences in the level of catecholamines at the nerve endings or other factors may be more important.

 STUDY OBJECTIVE: The need for clinical toxicology resources by emergency physicians is unclear and may have implications for future training and resource availability.
 This study was designed to assess current emergency physician use of available resources.
 DESIGN: Prospective evaluation by mail using a 49-item questionnaire.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All 170 emergency physicians in Utah.
 INTERVENTIONS: None.
 RESULTS: The response rate was 75.3% (128 of 170).
 Resources ""outside their own fund of knowledge"" were consulted ""occasionally"" to ""frequently"" by 98.3%.
 They used the following resources ""occasionally"" to ""frequently"": poison control center (PCC) (93.7%), toxicology textbook (77.6%), ""expert colleague"" (34.0%), and ""in-house POISINDEX"" (23.9%).
 They often contacted the PCC for toxicity information (93.7%) and management recommendations (87.3%) and for acute, symptomatic overdose cases (88.3%).
 They ""almost never"" contacted the PCC for adverse drug reactions (76.6%), pill identification (70.2%), consultation with physician toxicologist (68.1%), asymptomatic exposures (62.9%), chronic toxicity (50.4%), or solely to report the case to the American Association of Poison Control Centers data base (90.2%).
 Those who had access to in-house POISINDEX often did not consult the PCC (82.6%).
 Of those who did not have in-house POISINDEX, 42.8% contacted the PCC to access it.
 Providing access to physician toxicologist consultations was thought to be an important role for the PCC by 86.7%, but only 32% of physicians were using this option.
 CONCLUSION: The vast majority of emergency physicians in Utah consult the PCC only for acute, symptomatic overdoses.
 They view access to physician toxicologist consultation as an important role for the PCC but seldom use it.
 The availability of in-house POISINDEX decreases the likelihood of PCC consultations from emergency departments.
 The frequency of emergency physician consultation with the PCC may decrease as POISINDEX becomes available at more hospitals.

691,"Control of interleukin-1 beta expression by protein kinase C and cyclic adenosine monophosphate in myeloid leukemia cells.
 We have examined the signal transduction pathways leading to the expression of the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) gene in human myeloid leukemia cells lines.
 Two cell lines representing different stages of differentiation were used (HL-60, promyelocytic, and THP-1, mature monocytic).
 In accordance with previous studies, it was observed that a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), was a sufficient stimulus for induction of the IL-1 beta messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and IL-1 beta protein production in both of these cell lines.
 A structural analog of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) or agents elevating the endogenous cAMP levels (prostaglandin E2, forskolin) were not alone able to induce IL-1 beta expression, but they strongly enhanced the PMA-induced IL-1 beta production and IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation.
 Nuclear run off analysis showed that this elevation in IL-1 beta mRNA levels was due to an increased rate of transcription.
 If dbcAMP was added 6 hours before PMA to the cultures, no enhancement in the IL-1 beta production was seen, implying that for this enhancing effect both of these signals must be present simultaneously.
 PKC inhibitor, H7, also blocked effectively the PMA plus dbcAMP induced IL-1 beta production, while the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, HA1004, had no effect, suggesting that PKA activation is not involved in the mechanism of action of cAMP in this case.
 Collectively, the present findings show that cAMP-dependent signals can have a positive regulatory effect on the PKC-dependent activation of the IL-1 beta gene in cells derived from different stages of myeloid differentiation.

692,"The oncologic risks of skin preservation at mastectomy when combined with immediate reconstruction of the breast.
 Most oncologic surgeons agree that removal of the nipple, the areola and any recent scar at the site of the biopsy is necessary during a mastectomy for treatment of carcinoma of the breast.
 There is less agreement about what should be done with the remaining uninvolved mammary skin.
 Its preservation facilitates the performance of immediate reconstruction of the breast and can lead to improved aesthetic results, but many oncologists fear that this practice could lead to an increased incidence of local tumor recurrence.
 To determine if that fear was justified, 87 patients who had undergone unilateral or bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction for treatment of early carcinoma of the breast were studied.
 Preservation of uninvolved skin was used in all instances.
 All patients had a documented follow-up study of 12 months or more; the average follow-up time was 23.1 months.
 One peripheral local recurrence was observed.
 This 1.2 per cent rate of early local recurrence is lower than that reported from several series using modified radical mastectomy without skin preservation or immediate reconstruction, and suggests that skin preservation does not confer additional risks of local recurrence of carcinoma of the breast in properly selected patients.

693,"Extramammary Paget's disease of the bronchial epithelium.
 We report the first case, to our knowledge, of extramammary Paget's disease of the bronchial epithelium.
 The tumor displayed Paget's cells scattered within the bronchial epithelium in most of the lesion, but infiltrating into the bronchial submucosa and pulmonary parenchyma with microglandular and papillary patterns in some area.
 In addition to the histologic findings of coexistence with adenocarcinomatous components, in situ involvement into bronchial glands and ducts by Paget's cells was observed, suggesting that extramammary Paget's disease of the bronchial epithelium may be a variant of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, which is associated with bronchial glands.

694,"The mec-4 gene is a member of a family of Caenorhabditis elegans genes that can mutate to induce neuronal degeneration 
 Three dominant mutations of mec-4, a gene needed for mechanosensation, cause the touch-receptor neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans to degenerate.
 With deg-1, another C.
 elegans gene that can mutate to induce neuronal degeneration and that is similar in sequence, mec-4 defines a new gene family.
 Cross-hybridizing sequences are detectable in other species, raising the possibility that degenerative conditions in other organisms may be caused by mutations in similar genes.
 All three dominant mec-4 mutations affect the same amino acid.
 Effects of amino-acid substitutions at this position suggest that steric hindrance may induce the degenerative state.

695,"p53 mutations in colorectal cancer.
 Immunohistological staining of primary colorectal carcinomas with antibodies specific to p53 demonstrated gross overexpression of the protein in approximately 50% of the malignant tumors examined.
 Benign adenomas were all negative for p53 overexpression.
 To determine the molecular basis for this overexpression we examined p53 protein expression in 10 colorectal cancer cell lines.
 Six of the cell lines expressed high levels of p53 in ELISA, cell-staining, and immunoprecipitation studies.
 Direct sequencing and chemical-mismatch-cleavage analysis of p53 cDNA by using the polymerase chain reaction in these cell lines showed that all cell lines that expressed high levels of p53 were synthesizing mRNAs that encoded mutant p53 proteins.
 In two of those four cell lines where p53 expression was lower, point mutations were still detected.
 Thus, we conclude that overexpression of p53 is synonymous with mutation, but some mutations would not be detected by a simple immunohistochemical analysis.
 Mutation of the p53 gene is one of the commonest genetic changes in the development of human colorectal cancer.

696,"Detection of residual leukemia after bone marrow transplant for chronic myeloid leukemia: role of polymerase chain reaction in predicting relapse.
 We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect residual leukemia-specific mRNA in blood and marrow from 37 patients in complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission after allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
 Our two-step PCR method involved the use of ""nested primers"" in the second step and could detect one K562 cell diluted into 10(5) normal cells.
 Elaborate measures were taken to exclude false-positive and false-negative results.
 In nine patients whose blood and marrow were studied simultaneously the results were concordant (two positive and seven negative).
 Twenty-three patients transplanted in chronic phase (CP) with unmanipulated donor marrow were studied.
 Blood cells from nine of these patients were studied 3 to 6 months post-BMT and six were PCR positive; three were negative on subsequent studies.
 Blood cells from 18 patients studied between 8 months and 8 years post-BMT were all PCR negative.
 Nine patients transplanted in CP with T-cell-depleted marrow cells were studied.
 Blood from five was positive 3 to 24 months post-BMT; blood from five was negative 3 to 6 years post-BMT.
 Four patients no longer in first CP were studied after BMT with unmanipulated donor marrow.
 Blood from all four was positive 5 to 19 months post-BMT.
 Based on the known clinical results of transplant in these three cohorts we conclude that PCR may be positive within 6 months of BMT in patients who can expect long-lasting remission, whereas PCR positivity later after BMT may indicate that the probability of cure is reduced.
 Thus, the technique may prove useful for early assessment of new transplant protocols that might inadvertently increase the risk of relapse.

697,"New directions in medical imaging of cancer. Magnetic resonance methods and single photon emission computed tomography.
 Magnetic resonance methods and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are developing technologies that provide both functional and anatomic information.
 Their role in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer is the subject of current clinical research.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) delineates organs and tissue heterogeneities using differences in the relaxation parameters of water and fat protons; both protons and other nuclei can be imaged or studied by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to provide information on the state of naturally occurring or infused molecules.
 SPECT quantifies the distribution of radiolabeled agents in tissues and organs; labeled monoclonal antibodies provide highly specific imaging of tumors.
 Spatial resolution is the limiting technologic factor.
 Proton MRI provides the highest current resolution, better than 1 mm in vivo in deep tissues, whereas the resolution of MRS and SPECT is limited to several cubic centimeters.
 Recent advances in these technologies have significantly increased their specificity and ability to detect small, deep lesions.

698,"Histologic pattern analysis of basal cell carcinoma. Study of a series of 1039 consecutive neoplasms.
 This study attempts to define histologic patterns in 1039 consecutive cases of basal cell carcinoma and to correlate these patterns with adequacy of margins of surgical excision.
 Five major histologic patterns were identified: nodular, 218 cases (21%); superficial, 181 cases (17%); micronodular, 151 cases (15%); infiltrative, 77 cases (7%); and morpheic, 11 cases (1%).
 A mixed pattern (two or more major histologic patterns) was present in 401 cases (38.5%).
 Our study indicates that nodular and superficial basal cell carcinomas can be completely removed by simple surgical excision in a high percentage of cases (93.6% and 96.4%, respectively) whereas the micronodular, infiltrative, and morpheic basal cell carcinomas have a higher incidence of positive tumor margins (18.6%, 26.5%, and 33.3%, respectively) after excision.
 Mixed patterns that consisted of combinations of the nodular, micronodular, or infiltrative types exhibited a behavior similar to the pattern that resulted in a greater chance of incomplete surgical removal.

 Portal vein aneurysm is rare and its etiology is controversial.
 A case of extrahepatic portal vein aneurysm associated with an unusually tortuous portal vein is described.
 Real-time ultrasonography showed anechoic masslike lesions at the porta hepatis communicating with the superior mesenteric vein and intrahepatic portal branches.
 This suggested the presence of two saccular portal vein aneurysms, 27 x 21 mm and 21 x 13 mm in size.
 Magnetic resonance imaging and portal venography confirmed the portal vein aneurysms and an unusually tortuous portal vein curving caudally between them.
 The liver was histologically normal and there was no evidence of portal hypertension.
 It is speculated that these portal vein aneurysms may have been congenital and that the associated tortuous portal vein might have been secondary to hemodynamic changes in the portal venous system.

703,"A new method for quantification of regurgitant flow rate using color Doppler flow imaging of the flow convergence region proximal to a discrete orifice. An in vitro study.
 While color Doppler flow mapping has yielded a quick and relatively sensitive method for visualizing the turbulent jets generated in valvular insufficiency, quantification of the degree of valvular insufficiency has been limited by the dependence of visualization of turbulent jets on hemodynamic as well as instrument-related factors.
 Color Doppler flow imaging, however, does have the capability of reliably showing the spatial relations of laminar flows.
 An area where flow accelerates proximal to a regurgitant orifice is commonly visualized on the left ventricular side of a mitral regurgitant orifice, especially when imaging is performed with high gain and a low pulse repetition frequency.
 This area of flow convergence, where the flow stream narrows symmetrically, can be quantified because velocity and the flow cross-sectional area change in inverse proportion along streamlines centered at the orifice.
 In this study, a gravity-driven constant-flow system with five sharp-edged diaphragm orifices (ranging from 2.9 to 12 mm in diameter) was imaged both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of flow through the orifice.
 Color Doppler flow images were produced by zero shifting so that the abrupt change in display color occurred at different velocities.
 This ""aliasing boundary"" with a known velocity and a measurable radial distance from the center of the orifice was used to determine an isovelocity hemisphere such that flow rate through the orifice was calculated as 2 pi r2 x Vr, where r is the radial distance from the center of the orifice to the color change and Vr is the velocity at which the color change was noted.
 Using Vr values from 54 to 14 cm/sec obtained with a 3.75-MHz transducer and from 75 to 18 cm/sec obtained with a 2.5-MHz transducer, we calculated flow rates and found them to correlate with measured flow rates (r = 0.94-0.99).
 The slope of the regression line was closest to unity when the lowest Vr and the correspondingly largest r were used in the calculation.
 The flow rates estimated from color Doppler flow imaging could also be used in conjunction with continuous-wave Doppler measurements of the maximal velocity of flow through the orifice to calculate orifice areas (r = 0.75-0.96 correlation with measured areas).

706,"Skin reflectance pulse oximetry: in vivo measurements from the forearm and calf.
 This study describes the results from a series of human experiments demonstrating the ability to measure arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2) from the forearm and calf using a reflectance pulse oximeter sensor.
 A special optical reflectance sensor that includes a heating element was interfaced to a temperature controller and a commercial Data-scope ACCUSAT pulse oximeter that was adapted for this study to perform as a reflectance pulse oximeter.
 The reflectance pulse oximeter sensor was evaluated in a group of 10 healthy adult volunteers during steady-state hypoxia.
 Hypoxia was induced by gradually lowering the inspired fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas mixture from 100 to 12%.
 Simultaneous SaO2 measurements obtained from the forearm and calf with two identical reflectance pulse oximeters were compared with SaO2 values measured by a finger sensor that was interfaced to a standard Datascope ACCUSAT transmittance pulse oximeter.
 The equations for the best-fitted linear regression lines between the percent reflectance, SpO2(r), and transmittance, SpO2(t), values in the range between 73 and 100% were SpO2(r) = -7.06 + 1.09 SpO2(t) for the forearm (n = 91, r = 0.95) and SpO2(r) = 7.78 + 0.93 SpO2(t) for the calf (n = 93, r = 0.88).

 The genetic and cultural heritability and intercorrelation of traits related to hypertension have been carried out in 98 Utah pedigrees (2,500 person) and 58 sibships with two or more hypertensive persons (131 hypertensive persons).
 Although none of these traits has been established as a marker for ""sodium-sensitive hypertension,"" many of them are related at least indirectly to both electrolyte metabolism and risk of hypertension.
 Significant recessive monogenic effects and high total heritability (52-84%) were found for urinary kallikrein, high fat pattern index, intraerythrocytic sodium, Na-Li countertransport, and ouabain binding sites.
 Familial correlations more strongly attributable to shared environment than to genetic effects were found for Na,K-ATPase pump activity, intraerythrocytic magnesium, plasma digoxin-like factor, plasma renin activity, and plasma sodium concentration.
 All anthropometric variables tested showed highly significant genetic heritability with low and insignificant shared family environmental effects.
 Several of the genetically determined cellular cation tests also correlated with other genetic traits including plasma lipids, anthropometric measurements, and other cellular cation tests.

 An international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 2.99 was assigned to group A and 3.0 to 4.5 to group B; both groups were subsequently analyzed for thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications.
 Final evaluation included 51 and 48 patients, respectively.
 The follow-up was 626 months for group A (12.3 months/patient) and 486 months for group B (10.1 months/patient).
 The frequency of thromboembolism was equal in both groups: one transient ischemic attack in group A (a rate of 1.92/100 patient-years) and two transient ischemic attacks in group B (a rate of 4.94/100 patient-years).
 There was, however, a statistical difference in bleeding complications between the two groups (p less than 0.02).
 Two patients bled in group A, a rate of 3.9% (3.8/100 patient-years), which represents an incidence of one episode each 25.6 years of treatment; 10 patients bled in group B, a rate of 20.8% (24.7/100 patient-years) representing an incidence of one episode each 4 years of treatment.

 Between June 1987 and June 1989, 29 recurrent malignant gliomas or recurrent solitary brain metastases in 28 patients were treated in a Phase I study of interstitial irradiation and hyperthermia.
 Patient age ranged from 18 to 65 years, and the Karnofsky Performance Status scores ranged from 40 to 90%.
 There were 13 glioblastomas, 10 anaplastic astrocytomas, 3 melanomas, and 3 adenocarcinomas.
 Catheters were implanted stereotactically after computed tomography-based preplanning.
 Hyperthermia was administered before and after brachytherapy, using one to six 2450- or 915-MHz helical coil microwave antennas and one to three multisensor fiberoptic thermometry probes.
 The goal was to heat as much of the tumor as possible to 42.5 degrees C for 30 minutes.
 Within 30 minutes after the first hyperthermia treatment, implant catheters were afterloaded with high-activity iodine-125 seeds delivering tumor doses of 32.6 to 61.0 Gy.
 Most patients had no sensation of heating.
 Complications included seizures in 5 patients, reversible neurological changes in 9 patients, a scalp burn in 1, and infections in 3.
 Of 28 evaluable 2-month follow-up scans, 11 showed definite improvement in the radiological appearance of the tumor, 4 were slightly improved, 7 were stable, and 6 showed tumor progression.

 Quinapril hydrochloride is a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that has been extensively tested and found effective when administered once-a-day to hypertensive patients of both sexes and all degrees of hypertension and cardiac compromise, including those with left ventricular hypertrophy, with and without congestive heart failure.
 Observations with earlier ACE inhibitors led to reports that this class of drugs was relatively ineffective in older hypertensive patients.
 To ascertain the role of quinapril (greater than or equal to 10 mg/day) in older patients, its blood pressure-lowering effects in 1,175 hypertensive patients less than or equal to 65 years of age were compared with those in 304 patients greater than 65 years of age.
 An excellent response was observed in patients greater than 65 years of age with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic BP, 95 to 105 mm Hg) and moderate to severe hypertension (diastolic BP, 106 to 115 mm Hg).
 The reductions in blood pressure achieved with quinapril were at least comparable to those obtained in the younger hypertensives, and were numerically (but not statistically) greater in the mild to moderate group (-14 mm Hg v-12 mm Hg).
 In addition, the percentage of patients who experienced adverse experiences was lower in the greater than 65 group than in the less than or equal to 65 group (15% v 19%).
 The main adverse experiences reported included dizziness, headache, cough, fatigue, and hypotension.

 Tissue samples from 57 patients with neuroepithelial tumors (25 glioblastomas, 18 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 14 astrocytomas) were analyzed in order to evaluate the presence of estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, and androgen receptors.
 Glucocorticoid- and androgen-specific binding proteins were present in 38.6% and 21.6% of the cases, respectively.
 Only a few tumors showed estrogen or progesterone receptors.
 A correlation was found between grade of anaplasia, patient's sex and age, and presence of glucocorticoid and androgen receptors.
 The biological role of these two receptors was investigated in 10 primary cell cultures derived from neuroepithelial tumors.
 For this purpose, dexamethasone and testosterone were added to culture medium at different concentrations (from 50 to 0.016 micrograms/ml).
 A significant stimulation of the cell growth was observed in four of five glucocorticoid receptor-positive cultures when dexamethasone in doses ranging from 2 to 0.016 microgram/ml was added to the culture.
 No modulation of the growth was observed in glucocorticoid receptor-negative cultures at the same doses.
 Higher dexamethasone doses induced a significant decrease of the growth index independently from the glucocorticoid receptor status.
 All of the cultures tested for testosterone activity were negative for androgen receptors.
 This hormone induced an inhibition of the growth index at doses ranging from 50 to 0.4 micrograms/ml.

 The allocation of patients with advanced germ cell tumors (GCT) to different treatment programs based on clinical characteristics is standard in the design of clinical trials today.
 Studies have shown that substantial differences exist between entry criteria and that these differences could influence the outcome of clinical trials.
 The factors contributing to these differences are not clear due to patient selection biases.
 Two hundred five unselected and consecutive patients allocated to and treated in good-risk and poor-risk treatment programs at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were reassigned risk status by the Indiana University (IU) Classification.
 The results were compared with those of the Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SECSG).
 The results using both criteria indicated substantial agreement in total end results and the identification of good-risk patients.
 The results in poor-risk patients differed substantially, with 39 patients (19%) classified as poor-risk by MSKCC criteria and 66 (32%) by Indiana criteria.
 The major discrepancy occurred in IU Stage 7, in which 26 of 32 patients (81%) achieved a complete response.
 The major factor contributing to this difference in risk assignment was the use of serum tumor markers.
 Serum tumor markers must be incorporated into risk assignment criteria for GCT clinical trials to minimize the number of good-risk GCT patients in poor-risk trials.

 A new quantitative method for evaluating regurgitation (TR) is proposed in order to select the most suitable treatment for functional TR associated with acquired valvular heart disease.
 The regurgitant volume per beat (VTR) is calculated using two-dimensional color Doppler and continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographies.
 In a study of 48 patients, preoperative VTR showed a significant correlation with tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole, right atrial mean pressure and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
 Patients were classified into 3 groups according to preoperative VTR: Group I, VTR less than 10 cc (no.
 18); Group II, VTR = 10-20 cc (no.
 18); Group III, VTR greater than or equal to 20 cc (no.

 This classification correlated well with the intraoperative findings of TR.
 In all Group I patients, VTR decreased without any tricuspid valve repair.
 In Group II, 17 of 18 patients underwent tricuspid annuloplasty, and showed a decrease in VTR to below 10 cc after surgery.
 In Group III, 10 underwent tricuspid annuloplasty and 2 tricuspid valve replacement.
 Three of the 10 with tricuspid annuloplasty showed a significant degree of postoperative VTR (10-20 cc).
 These 3 patients as well as the 2 with tricuspid valve replacement showed a preoperative peak-to-peak pressure difference across the tricuspid valve during the ejection phase (RVsp-TAv) of less than or equal to 20 mmHg and tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole of greater than or equal to 50 mm.
 In conclusion, no tricuspid valve repair was required in Group I (TR I).
 For group II (TR II) patients, tricuspid annuloplasty was necessary and adequate for TR correction.
 For Group II (TR III) patients, a more substantial procedure like tricuspid valve replacement should be performed, especially when the preoperative RVsp-RAv is less than or equal to 20 mmHg and tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole is greater than or equal to 50 mm.

 Eighteen patients completed a 2-year and 26 patients a 5-year follow-up examination.
 The effective orifice areas of identical models of bioprosthetic valves (Hancock II) were determined in vitro in a left-sided heart pulse duplicator system.
 In vivo Doppler-derived effective orifice areas were compared with the in vitro measurements for the same valve size.
 At both the 2- and 5-year follow-up examinations, the Doppler-derived effective orifice area was significantly less than the in vitro area (p less than 0.0001 at each interval).
 Ten of 16 valves evaluated serially decreased greater than 0.20 cm2 in the Doppler-derived effective orifice area between studies.
 The mean decrease in effective orifice area in valves evaluated serially was 0.25 +/- 0.29 cm2 (p less than 0.005).
 The peak transaortic gradient increased from 21 +/- 6 to 27 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01).
 The mean transaortic gradient increased from 12 +/- 4 to 15 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.05).
 It is concluded that serial Doppler echocardiographic studies demonstrate a deterioration in the hemodynamic performance of bioprosthetic valves over time in patients with no symptoms or signs of valvular dysfunction and that Doppler echocardiography may be useful for identifying subclinical bioprosthetic valvular dysfunction.

722,"Capillary hemangiomas and treatment with the flash lamp-pumped pulsed dye laser 
 Strawberry, or capillary, hemangiomas are common vascular neoplasms, with an incidence of approximately 2.6% in neonates.
 They usually develop in the first few weeks of life, so that between 1 month and 1 year the incidence rises to between 8.7% and 10.1%.
 These lesions may grow quite large in the first year of life, and they may ulcerate or obstruct a vital organ or function.
 The great majority will spontaneously regress after the first year of life.
 Parents are often alarmed at the sight of these hemangiomas and need reassurance that the great majority will regress spontaneously.
 Treatments such as cryosurgery, irradiation, radium instillation, corticosteroid therapy, or surgical excision are often ineffective or cause significant morbidity.
 We describe 10 children with capillary hemangiomas treated with the flash lamp-pumped pulsed dye laser.
 The patients ranged in age from 7 weeks to 5.5 years at the beginning of laser therapy.
 The patients underwent 3.1 +/- 1 (mean +/- SD) laser treatments, with a mean regression of the lesions of 69.9% +/- 4.5%.
 All patients demonstrated some diminution in the size and color of their hemangiomas after the treatments, and there were no ill effects, such as ulceration, hemorrhage, infection, or scarring.
 There was no evidence of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation.
 Pulsed dye laser therapy should be considered as an option in the treatment of capillary hemangiomas, preferably prior to their full evolution.
 It is also a useful therapeutic approach in those hemangiomas that are slow to regress in older children.

 Cardiac arrhythmias are well recognized sequelae of the Fontan operation for complex congenital anomalies.
 In this study the electrophysiologic effects of the Fontan procedure were evaluated in 30 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization with electrophysiologic study 1.9 +/- 1.3 years (mean +/- SD) after modified Fontan repair for functional single ventricle.
 Abnormalities of sinus node or ectopic pacemaker automaticity were detected in 50% (15 patients) by determination of a prolonged corrected sinus node or pacemaker recovery time.
 Total sinoatrial conduction time was prolonged in 50% of the patients with normal sinus rhythm.
 Sinus node or ectopic atrial pacemaker function was entirely normal in only 43% of patients.
 The predominant atrial rhythm was normal sinus in 70% and ectopic atrial or junctional in 30%.
 Abnormalities of atrial effective and functional refractory periods were noted in 43% of patients and were most pronounced at faster paced cycle lengths.
 Atrial endocardial catheter mapping revealed intraatrial conduction delays between adjacent sites in 76% of the patients tested and in eight of nine patients with inducible intraatrial reentry.
 Programmed atrial stimulation induced nonsustained supraventricular arrhythmias in 10% of the 30 patients and sustained arrhythmias in 27%.
 Intraatrial reentry was the most common inducible arrhythmia and was present in seven of the eight patients with sustained and two of the three patients with nonsustained atrial arrhythmias.
 Atrioventricular conduction abnormalities were noted in 10% (three patients).
 No patient had inducible ventricular arrhythmias with programmed ventricular stimulation.
 The electrophysiologic findings after Fontan repair include abnormal sinus node function, prolonged atrial refractoriness, delayed intraatrial conduction and inducible atrial arrhythmias.

 A survey of the health and social circumstances of 662 people aged 85 and over, living at home in inner London, was conducted in 1987.
 A primary aim was to analyze the structure of social support networks of the sample in relation to respondents' emotional well-being and met and unmet needs for practical help.
 The conceptual and methodological framework that was applied to the study was derived from the theory of social networks.
 In confirmation of the common assumption that people aged 85+ are different from younger elderly people, as they are the ""survivors,"" high levels of social support and informal help were given to most respondents.
 Although associations were found between social network variables and the provision of informal help, multifactorial analysis showed that health status explained more of the variation in emotional well-being.

 Two patients studied with technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells (RBCs) for gastrointestinal bleeding had positive findings only on 24-hr delayed images, at which time the site of bleeding could not be ascertained.
 In each instance, when additional delayed images suggested that active bleeding was occurring, a second aliquot of RBCs was labeled and injected.
 Sites of active hemorrhage were identified following further imaging in both patients.
 When delayed GI bleeding images are positive, further views should be obtained to ascertain if the pattern of intraluminal activity changes.
 If renewed active hemorrhage is suspected, reinjection with a second dose of labeled RBCs may identify the bleeding site.

 The CT findings regarding neoplastic invasion of adjacent organs and metastasis or enlarged lymph nodes were compared with the findings at laparotomy (85 cases) or autopsy (5 cases), thus permitting evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of CT and its usefulness for predicting resectability.
 When present, neoplastic invasion of adjacent organs was overestimated or underestimated by CT in 21 cases.
 Invasion of adjacent organs according to CT was false positive in 17 cases and false negative in 11 cases.
 When liver metastasis or enlarged regional or distant lymph nodes were present, CT overestimated or underestimated their extent in 17 cases, and the diagnosis was false positive in one case and false negative in 33 cases.
 The positive and negative predictive values of CT concerning resectability of the tumor were 81% and 64%, respectively.
 Routine preoperative CT in gastric malignancy is concluded to be of limited value and surgical exploration, when feasible, remains the method of choice.

 While avid accumulation of gallium-67 citrate and technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) occurs initially in most cases of primary Ewing sarcoma, uptake after therapy is less well defined.
 Thirty patients with Ewing sarcoma who underwent Ga-67 and bone scintigraphy at diagnosis, at completion of therapy, and at relapse from 1978 to 1988 were evaluated.
 All 30 patients showed less primary site Ga-67 activity following therapy.
 Twenty-three of 28 patients who underwent corresponding bone scintigraphy showed less uptake, but residual activity was usually more intense than with Ga-67.
 Avid reaccumulation of Ga-67 occurred in four of five patients with primary site relapse, while patients who underwent bone scintigraphy showed less change.
 It was concluded that a greater decrease in Ga-67 than in Tc-99m MDP uptake often occurs in patients successfully treated for primary Ewing sarcoma.
 Information obtained at Ga-67 scintigraphy is most likely to be helpful if results of bone scintigraphy remain abnormal or if occult relapse is suspected.

 To evaluate the influence of antiplatelet drugs on patency in femoropopliteal vein bypasses, 48 vascular surgeons recruited 549 patients to a randomized double-blind trial of aspirin (300 mg) + dipyridamole (150 mg) or placebo twice daily starting 2 days before surgery and continuing indefinitely.
 Graft occlusion measured objectively by independent coordinators and cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or stroke) were studied, expressed by life table, and analyzed statistically by log rank and confidence intervals (95% CI).
 Randomization achieved comparable groups with 60% of grafts inserted for rest pain or gangrene.
 Operative complications on aspirin plus dipyridamole included 18 reoperations for bleeding and 12 hematomas compared with 9 and 14, respectively, on placebo (NS).
 Most of the 172 graft failures occurred early with failure rates of 43/1000 patient-months in the first 3 months, reducing to 17/1000 at 6 to 12 months, and under 10/1000 in subsequent years.
 Cumulative graft patency on placebo was 72%, 62%, and 60% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively, compared with 78%, 70%, and 61% on aspirin plus dipyridamole.
 The difference in patency of 6.1% (95% CI, -3% to 15.5%) at 1 year and 8.0% (95% CI, -5% to 21%) at 2 years failed to achieve significance (p = 0.43).
 On mean follow-up of 34 months, 53 (132/1000 patient-years) cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident) occurred in patients on placebo compared with only 35 (73/1000) on aspirin plus dipyridamole, a significant difference of 59/1000 (p = 0.004).

 We examined the signal transduction mechanism responsible for the IFN-gamma-induced HLA class II molecule expressions on glioblastoma cell lines, T98G and A172.
 A series of experiments demonstrated that the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the DR and DP molecule expressions on T98G cells.
 In addition to the activation of PKC, calcium influx appeared to be involved in the DR and DP molecule expressions on T98G.
 Northern blot analyses with actinomycin D or cycloheximide revealed that these second messengers induce the transcription of DRA and B and DPA and B genes without de novo protein synthesis.
 Furthermore, we examined the region of the DPB gene that is responsible for IFN-gamma-induced gene transcription by gene transfer of a series of 5' and 3' deletion mutants in which the upstream region of the DPB was linked to a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.
 By using these deletion mutants, it appeared that the region between -152 and -126 bp contains a critical IFN-gamma-responsive element.
 Taken together, these results suggest that IFN-gamma activates PKC and stimulates calcium influx, resulting in the induction of transcription of DRA and B and DPA and B genes without de novo protein synthesis.
 In DPB gene, we speculate that preexiting protein(s) phosphorylated by PKC in the presence of Ca2+ might directly bind or indirectly interact with the region between -152 and -126 bp of the upstream sequence, leading to the induction of the transcription (possibly in concert with other nuclear protein(s) bound to the promoter sequences).

 Primary liver cancer (PLC) of the hepatic hilus was designated as a tumor situated at the main branch of the portal vein or pedicle of the hepatic veins in contact with the intrahepatic vena cava.
 That is, the main tumor located at segment I, IV, V, or VIII and concentrating on the central part of the liver was called ""the central type of PLC,"" which differed from a tumor located at segment II, III, VI, or VII; the latter was called ""the peripheral type of PLC."" Surgical treatment of the PLC has been significantly improved in the past two decades, but the resection of the central type of PLC is difficult and hazardous.
 This institution admitted 903 PLC from January 1970 to April 1988, of which 118 cases were the central type; 65 cases were resected successfully, a resectability of 55.1%.
 One patient died from sepsis within 1 month of operation (mortality 1.53%).
 The modes of operation for the different segments are described, and suggestions for improvements are presented.
 The survival rates were compared with a similar number of patients with the peripheral type of tumor in the same period and treated by the same surgeons.
 The results show noticeable differences.

 Sixty-two patients with metastatic disease were treated with continuous infusion folinic acid (leucovorin calcium; Lv) and 2-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (floxuridine; FUDR).
 Lv was given by constant intravenous (IV) infusion at 500 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 6, while FUDR was given by IV push, days 2 to 6, at 3:00 PM daily with doses ranging from 294 to 1,214 mg/m2/d.
 This program was well tolerated with dose-limiting toxicities of diarrhea and stomatitis, while hematologic toxicity was minimal.
 Eighty-two percent of the assessable patients (46 of 56) had failed at least one chemotherapy regimen.
 One complete remission lasting 9 months and 10 partial remissions ranging from 5 to 10 months were observed in this heavily pretreated patient population for an overall response rate of 20%.
 These data suggest that the combination therapy with Lv and FUDR may have clinical use.
 Because of differing patient sensitivity to this drug combination, the recommended dose of FUDR for the initial therapy cycle is 500 mg/m2/d, days 2 to 6, with subsequent escalation to 900 mg/m2/d in those patients without extreme sensitivity.

 This article explores the hypothesis that migraine with aura is associated with a state of central neuronal hyperexcitability.
 The authors propose that this central neuronal hyperexcitability involves overactivity of the excitatory amino acids, glutamate, and possibly aspartate.
 Stimuli that activate the migraine attack evoke neuronal depolarization, slow depolarization shifts, and spreading suppression of spontaneous neuronal activity possible by glutamate and K+ dependent mechanisms.
 A low brain Mg2+ and consequent reduced gating of glutamatergic receptors may provide the link between the physiologic threshold for a migraine attack and the mechanisms of the attack itself by promoting glutamate hyperactivity, neuronal hyperexcitability, and susceptibility to glutamate-dependent spreading depression.

 Radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) using an anti-CEA (A5B7) monoclonal antibody has been assessed in 52 patients (43 primary excisions and nine second look procedures) undergoing surgery for colorectal carcinoma.
 The antibody localized in 97.8 percent of primary tumours and in 88.8 percent of the principal tumor in second look procedures.
 Additional information concerning the extent of primary tumor was obtained in 11 of 43 patients (25.5 percent) undergoing excision of primary carcinoma and five of nine patients (55 percent) in the second look series.
 Incorrect information was obtained about the extent of the primary tumour in six patients (11.3 percent), whereas no incorrect information was obtained during second look procedures.
 RIGS correctly predicted the subsequent Dukes' staging in 77 percent of first look cases (sensitivity 65 percent, specificity 90 percent), although accurate identification of individual nodes was impossible.
 The technique influenced the surgical procedure performed in 2 of 43 cases (4.6 percent) in primary surgery and in three of nine patients undergoing second look laparotomy (33 percent).
 RIGS in primary colorectal carcinoma may provide additional information concerning extent of locally advanced tumors in particular and the principle that the subsequent surgery may be influenced has been established.
 The technique appears to have a greater role in second look procedures where it may help determine the extent of recurrent tumour.
 Larger follow-up series are required to define how the additional information provided by this technique may best be exploited.

741,"Metabolic considerations in the choice of therapy for the patient with hypertension.
 The objective of treating patients with hypertension is not simply to reduce blood pressure but rather to prevent the associated morbidity and mortality.
 Recent assessments of clinical trials have shown that while the risk of stroke is consistently lower with antihypertensive therapy, the same degree of success has not been demonstrated for coronary artery disease (CAD).
 Although there are many explanations of why we have not done as well in preventing CAD, one possibility is that the therapy used in clinical trials, primarily thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, has increased the patient's risk of developing coronary atherosclerosis or lethal arrhythmias.
 Four classes of antihypertensive agents are recommended for initial therapy--thiazide diuretics, beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium entry blockers.
 The metabolic effects of thiazide diuretics include electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyponatremia), dyslipidemia (increased triglycerides), abnormalities of glucose metabolism (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and peripheral insulin resistance), and hyperuricemia.
 beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers have many of the same metabolic adverse reactions.
 beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) also cause dyslipidemias (lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased triglycerides) and abnormalities of glucose metabolism (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and peripheral insulin resistance).
 beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers with ISA and third-generation beta-blockers with selective partial agonist activity (celiprolol and dilevalol) do not cause dyslipidemia and to date do not appear to induce abnormalities in glucose metabolism.
 ACE inhibitors may decrease triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and captopril may improve insulin sensitivity.
 Calcium entry blockers are metabolically neutral.

742,"The nature of opioid responsiveness and its implications for neuropathic pain: new hypotheses derived from studies of opioid infusions.
 In recent years, the observation that the response of patients to opioid drugs may be influenced by properties inherent in the pain or pain syndrome, such as its pathophysiology, has evolved into the belief that certain types of pain, e.g., neuropathic pains, may be unresponsive to these drugs.
 This concept has important implications for both clinical practice and basic understanding of opioid mechanisms.
 We critically evaluate opioid responsiveness, particularly as it relates to neuropathic pain, and propose a clinically relevant definition and a paradigm for its investigation.
 The paradigm is illustrated by analgesic responses to opioid infusion in 28 patients with neuropathic pains and by a detailed presentation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships in one of these patients, whose central pain responded promptly to an infusion of hydromorphone.
 From this analysis, we hypothesize that (1) opioid responsiveness in man can be defined by the degree of analgesia achieved during dose escalation to either intolerable side effects or the occurrence of 'complete' or 'adequate' analgesia; (2) opioid responsiveness is a continuum, rather than a quantal phenomenon; (3) opioid responsiveness is determined by a diverse group of patient characteristics and pain-related factors, as well as drug-selective effects; and (4) a neuropathic mechanism may reduce opioid responsiveness, but does not result in an inherent resistance to these drugs.
 Given the complexity of factors contributing to opioid responsiveness and the observation that outcome cannot be reliably predicted, opioids should not be withheld on the assumption that pain mechanism, or any other factor, precludes a favorable response.
 Both the clinical use of opioids and paradigms to investigate opioid responsiveness should include dose escalation to maximally tolerated levels and repeated monitoring of analgesia and other effects.

 To define a more sensitive and reliable method to determine changes in the overall cellular characteristics of erythrocytes after oxidative damage, we used a viscodiffractometric method (ektacytometry) to measure the effect of oxidative stress.
 Erythrocytes were incubated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, or cumene hydroperoxide in phosphate buffer.
 This treatment resulted in decreased cellular deformability of the intact erythrocytes.
 In addition, deformability and fragility measurements of the erythrocyte ghost membranes indicated an increased membrane dynamic rigidity and altered-mechanical stability as a consequence of oxidant stress.
 These changes were observed before the onset of hemolysis.
 The observed decrease in deformability was accompanied by oxidation of hemoglobin, alterations of membrane proteins, and lipid peroxidation.
 To continuously measure the time course of the decrease in deformability in intact erythrocytes under oxidative stress, a new ektacytometric method was developed.
 Erythrocytes were oxidatively challenged within the viscometer at a constant osmolality and shear stress.
 The change in deformability was monitored and a typical range was defined for erythrocytes from normal individuals.
 Comparison of erythrocytes from patients with sickle cell disease with those from normal individuals demonstrated a higher susceptibility of sickle red cells toward oxidative stress.

 Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is known to be increased in patients and experimental animals with chronic cardiac failure (CCF).
 The importance of an increase in biosynthesis of AVP in the hypothalamus has, however, not heretofore been investigated and is the purpose of the present study.
 CCF secondary to infarction of myocardial tissue was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and sham operated animals served as controls.
 Four weeks later hypothalamic AVP mRNA was determined by solution hybridization using sense and anti-sense strand RNA.
 The blood pressure was lower in CCF than sham animals (131.2 +/- 3.1 vs.
 112.8 +/- 4.0 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) and the total heart, and right and left ventricle weights were significantly higher in CCF rats.
 Plasma AVP was higher in CCF (sham 6.78 +/- 0.30; CCF 11.46 +/- 0.64 pg/ml, P less than 0.001) and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was also higher in CCF than sham animals (205 +/- 36 vs.

 There was no difference in beta-actin mRNA in the hypothalamus of sham and CCF rats, indicating that the AVP-mRNA increase was specific in CCF.
 These results therefore demonstrate that increased AVP biosynthesis in the hypothalamus, in addition to release of the hormone from the posterior pituitary, may occur in CCF.

 Halothane, in a dose-dependent manner, induced the release of intracellular Ca2+ in hepatocytes prepared from swine.
 The magnitude of the release induced by halothane was greater for hepatocytes prepared from animals susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH) than for those from normal swine.
 Two different methods were used to ascertain the release of Ca2+ induced by halothane: 1) the release of 45Ca2+ from nonmitochondrial stores of saponin-permeabilized hepatocytes was measured; and 2) changes in luminescence from intact hepatocytes loaded with the Ca2(+)-sensitive photoprotein aequorin were recorded.
 It was also observed that, although 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3), guanosine-5-triphosphate, and arachidonic acid all induced a significant release of 45Ca2+ from permeabilized swine hepatocytes, only the quantities of 45Ca2+ released by IP3 were significantly greater for the hepatocytes prepared from the animals susceptible to MH.
 These data indicate an abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis in hepatocytes isolated from swine susceptible to MH, which supports the hypothesis that membrane systems from multiple organs may be affected in this genetic disorder.

 Disruptions in the gene encoding the POU-domain transcription factor, Pit-1, occur in both characterized alleles of the dwarf locus.
 The data indicate that Pit-1 is necessary for the specification of the phenotype of three cell types in the anterior pituitary, and directly link a transcription factor to commitment and progression events in mammalian organogenesis.

750,"Fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count are major risk factors for ischemic heart disease. The Caerphilly and Speedwell collaborative heart disease studies 
 BACKGROUND.
 Recent studies have suggested that hemostatic factors and white blood cell count are predictive of ischemic heart disease (IHD).
 The relations of fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count to the incidence of IHD in the Caerphilly and Speedwell prospective studies are described.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 The two studies have a common core protocol and are based on a combined cohort of 4,860 middle-aged men from the general population.
 The first follow-up was at a nearly constant interval of 5.1 years in Caerphilly and 3.2 years in Speedwell; 251 major IHD events had occurred.
 Age-adjusted relative odds of IHD for men in the top 20% of the distribution compared with the bottom 20% were 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.6-6.5) for fibrinogen, 4.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-7.4) for viscosity, and 3.2 (95% confidence interval, 2.0-4.9) for white blood cell count.
 Associations with IHD were similar in men who had never smoked, exsmokers, and current smokers, and the results suggest that at least part of the effect of smoking on IHD is mediated through fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count.
 Multivariate analysis shows that white blood cell count is an independent risk factor for IHD as is either fibrinogen or viscosity, or possibly both.
 Jointly, these three variables significantly improve the fit of a logistic regression model containing all the main conventional risk factors.
 Further, a model including age, smoking habits, fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count predicts IHD as well as one in which the three hemostatic/rheological variables are replaced by total cholesterol, diastolic pressure, and body mass index.
 CONCLUSION.
 Jointly, fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count are important risk factors for IHD.

751,"Ovarian metastases are rare in stage I adenocarcinoma of the cervix.
 Over a 32-year period at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center, all cases of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix were reviewed to determine the incidence of ovarian metastases in stage I disease.
 One of 25 patients (4.0%) who underwent an exploratory laparotomy and radical hysterectomy had a microscopic ovarian metastasis.
 A literature review identified nine additional patients who had ovarian metastases and stage I adenocarcinoma of the cervix.
 Including our series, the overall reported rate of ovarian metastases is 1.8%.
 All ten patients had at least one of the following additional characteristics: They were postmenopausal, they had adnexal pathology, or they had positive pelvic lymph nodes.
 Thus, ovarian preservation is warranted in premenopausal patients who do not have ovarian pathology or evidence of other metastatic disease at surgery.
 Bilateral oophorectomy may be performed if frozen-section examination of enlarged or suspicious nodes documents metastases.
 If the ovaries are left in the pelvis at the completion of the surgical procedure and microscopic spread to other pelvic tissues is documented, pelvic irradiation can be administered.

752,"Characterization of spontaneous termination of sustained ventricular tachycardia associated with coronary artery disease.
 To characterize the change in cycle length and QRS morphology before spontaneous termination of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), electrocardiograms were recorded and VT cycle length measured for the periods 31 to 21 and 11 to 1 beats before termination in 55 episodes from 28 patients with coronary artery disease.
 Beats 31 to 21 were designated as a period of stable arrhythmia and served as a reference for changes occurring just before termination.
 Forty-four episodes of VT occurred in the setting of antiarrhythmic drug therapy; 11 episodes occurred in patients not treated with antiarrhythmic drugs.
 Variability in cycle length was indexed by the standard deviation of the mean cycle length and by the percentage of consecutive cycles varying by greater than or equal to 40 ms (% greater than or equal to 40 ms).
 There was greater variability just before termination (standard deviation of the mean cycle length, 25.8 ms; % greater than or equal to 40 ms, 16.7%) than during the stable period (standard deviation of the mean cycle length, 8.5 ms; % greater than or equal to 40 ms, 5.4%; p less than 0.001 for both).
 This was true irrespective of antiarrhythmic drug use, although the differences in the standard deviation of the mean cycle length for beats 11 to 1 and for beats 31 to 21 were greater for the antiarrhythmic drug group (29.6 vs 8.9 ms, p less than 0.001) than for the group not receiving antiarrhythmic drugs (11.0 vs 6.7 ms, difference not significant).
 No specific patterns of cycle length variability characteristic of VT termination were found.

753,"Patient-controlled analgesia in children and adolescents: a randomized, prospective comparison with intramuscular administration of morphine for postoperative analgesia.
 A randomized, prospective trial of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), that is, a method of analgesia administration involving a computer-driven pump activated by patients to receive small doses within defined limits was performed in 82 children and adolescents after major orthopedic surgery to compare (1) intramuscularly administered morphine, (2) PCA morphine and (3) PCA morphine with a low-dose continuous morphine infusion (PCA-plus).
 Patients receiving PCA and PCA-plus had lower pain scores and greater satisfaction than patients receiving intramuscularly administered morphine.
 The three groups used equal amounts of morphine and most measures of recovery were identical in the groups.
 In particular, PCA and PCA-plus did not increase the incidence of opioid-related complications, and patients receiving PCA-plus were less sedated than patients receiving intramuscular therapy.
 We conclude that PCA and PCA-plus are safe and effective methods of pain relief in children and adolescents after orthopedic surgery, are better accepted than intramuscular injections, and do not increase perioperative morbidity.

 From 1976 to 1988, 35 patients were treated for Stage IE and Stage IIE primary gastric lymphoma (non-Hodgkin's).
 Pain and weight loss were the predominant symptoms, physical findings were usually absent and 20 per cent of the patients were anemic.
 The results of gastrointestinal contrast studies suggested a malignant condition in 75 per cent, but findings were not specific for lymphoma.
 Endoscopic findings suggested a malignant process in 85 per cent, but the yield for biopsy was only 60 per cent.
 Of 28 patients undergoing operative exploration, 75 per cent were resectable.
 Nine patients received postresectional adjuvant therapy.
 Five had chemotherapy; three, radiotherapy, and one patient, a combination of the two.
 Primary nonsurgical treatment consisted of chemotherapy in 11, radiotherapy in two and combined therapy in one instance.
 Three of five recurrences were successfully treated.
 The five year survival rate was 65 per cent without significant differences between surgical and nonsurgical regimens.
 Those with tumors smaller than 7 centimeters had a five year survival rate of 100 per cent versus 50 per cent for larger neoplasms.
 Patients more than 60 years of age appeared to have a more favorable course after surgical therapy compared with those who had nonsurgical treatment.
 We concluded that endoscopy is a most useful, although limited diagnostic study and since no treatment program is obviously superior, the choice of therapy can be individualized accordingly.

755,"Elderly patients with congestive heart failure under prepaid care.
 PURPOSE: Because of concern about the quality of care received by Medicare patients in health maintenance organizations (HMOs), the care of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) in eight HMOs was compared with the care of fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare cases.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the care of 170 patients with CHF enrolled in one of eight Medicare HMOs with the care of 191 similar FFS patients.
 Panels of expert physicians developed criteria for evaluating quality of care, and specially trained nurse clinicians abstracted medical records.
 RESULTS: Outpatient evaluation and management were similar in both settings, although HMO patients were significantly more likely to be advised to restrict salt intake.
 However, FFS patients with uncontrolled hypertension were more likely to have their medication regimens changed (62% versus 36%, p less than 0.01).
 Ejection fractions were obtained equally as often, and inpatient management was similar for both groups.
 Nonetheless, HMO providers scheduled follow-up visits within 1 week of hospital discharge more often (42% versus 27%, p less than 0.01).
 CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that financial incentives of prepaid care are not detrimental to most aspects of care for CHF patients.
 More rapid follow-up after hospital discharge for patients with CHF suggests that HMOs may be more effective in delivering continuity of care for patients with chronic illness.

756,"Complete left main coronary artery occlusion: angiographic evaluation of collateral vessel patterns and assessment of hemodynamic correlates.
 An angiographic study of eight patients with total occlusion of the left main coronary artery identified six patients with chronic occlusion and two with acute complete occlusion.
 In each of six patients, there were two to six different intercoronary collateral pathways.
 Altogether, a total of 13 specific collateral channels were recognized.
 One patient had evidence of unique homocollaterals represented by enlarged vasa vasorum, which created a vascular cuff that surrounded a totally obstructed left main artery.
 The ventricular function and hemodynamic parameters in these patients not only depend on the collateral vessels but may also be affected by the severity of coronary artery disease in the artery that supplies collaterals.

 An anti-CD3 Fab' x anti-CD10 Fab' bispecific hybrid F(ab')2 antibody (Ab) was generated.
 This bispecific Ab had a molecular mass of 100 to 110 Kd, and the capacity to react with both CD3+ T cells and CD10+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells.
 We studied whether cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) could lyse patient CD10+ ALL cells after addition of the bispecific Ab.
 As effector CTLs, interleukin-2 (IL-2)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CTL clones were used.
 When IL-2-stimulated PBMCs were assayed for cytotoxicity to 61Cr-labeled CD10+ ALL cells, their activity was shown to be markedly enhanced by the addition of the bispecific Ab.
 Most of the CTL clones established lacked cytotoxicity for CD10+ ALL cells, but addition of the bispecific Ab induced a significant level of cytotoxicity.
 CTLs derived from ALL patients also showed significant cytotoxicity for autologous CD10+ ALL cells after addition of the bispecific Ab.
 However, this Ab did not affect the cytotoxicity of CTLs when CD10- leukemic cells were used as the targets.
 These findings suggest that the bispecific Ab can be used for immunotherapy in patients with CD10+ ALL.

758,"When do cerebral emboli appear during open heart operations? A transcranial Doppler study.
 The transcranial Doppler technique enabled the detection of cerebral air emboli in 10 of 10 patients during open-heart valve operations despite standard deairing procedures.
 With this technique, the occurrence of emboli in the right middle cerebral artery was followed continuously in patients undergoing aortic or mitral valve replacement.
 Membrane oxygenators were used.
 Scattered emboli were observed during the insertion of the aortic cannula, at the start of cardiopulmonary bypass, and after the declamping of the aorta with the heart beating while empty.
 During the period of aortic cross-clamping, no emboli were detected.
 Despite careful deairing procedures, the recordings indicated a large amount of emboli during filling of the empty beating heart in all 10 patients.
 Thus, this study indicates that cerebral emboli in open heart procedures are most likely to occur during the redistribution of blood from the heart-lung machine to the patient when the heart is beginning to eject actively, despite careful standard deairing procedures.
 Meticulous deairing before declamping the aorta is strongly advocated.
 In addition, a short period of filling of the beating heart before final closure of the aortic incision or vent may decrease the incidence of cerebral emboli.
 A concomitant reduction in cerebral blood flow by hyperventilation or anesthetics or both during filling of the empty beating heart may also be beneficial.

 The antihypertensive effects and safety profiles of lisinopril (10 to 40 mg) and atenolol (50 to 100 mg) were compared in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 144 patients with essential hypertension.
 After 8 weeks of therapy, seated blood pressure (BP) decreased by 26/15 mm Hg with lisinopril and by 19/14 mm Hg with atenolol.
 Lisinopril produced a greater reduction (p less than 0.05) in sitting systolic BP than did atenolol.
 Standing BP decreased by 25/15 mm Hg with lisinopril and by 19/14 mm Hg with atenolol.
 No important changes in hematologic and biochemical profiles were seen with either drug.
 Eleven patients, 7 receiving lisinopril and 4 receiving atenolol, were withdrawn because of adverse experiences; another 3 patients defaulted during treatment, 1 in the lisinopril group and 2 in the atenolol group.
 Both drugs were well-tolerated and are therefore suitable for first-line therapy in essential hypertension.

 Infants receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy undergo long-term cardiopulmonary bypass, are systemically heparinized, and frequently receive platelet transfusions.
 Prostacyclin is a powerful inhibitor of platelet aggregation as well as a potent vasodilator.
 The levels of its stable metabolite prostaglandin F1 alpha increase significantly in children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass during heart operations but decrease to preoperative levels after bypass.
 To determine the effect of long-term bypass on prostacyclin levels, multiple plasma samples were analyzed in 10 human neonates both during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy and within 24 hours after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
 Prostaglandin F1 alpha, the stable metabolite of prostacyclin, was quantitated by radioimmunoassay in picograms per milliliter.
 Prostaglandin F1 alpha levels were elevated while the patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy but decreased with duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
 In most infants, prostaglandin F1 alpha levels rose again during weaning from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and remained elevated for 24 hours after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation course influenced circulating prostaglandin F1 alpha levels.
 Fluctuating prostaglandin F1 alpha levels are of clinical significance in the management of vasomotor tone and platelet function, common problems in the care and the prevention of hemorrhage in these critically ill infants.

 The relationship between Ki-67 proliferative activity and nuclear estrogen receptor content was also investigated on adjacent tissue sections.
 Ki-67 values ranged from 1 to 75%, with a median value of 10%.
 Premenopausal patients had greater Ki-67 values (median value, 14.1%) than postmenopausal ones (median value, 9.8%).

 We studied the possibility that the complement activation product C3a des-Arg is trapped within the coronary circulation during reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium.
 In 11 patients undergoing routine coronary artery bypass grafting, arterial blood was sampled before, during and after cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Blood was drawn from the coronary sinus concomitantly with arterial blood sampling 5 and 30 min after release of the aortic cross-clamp (n = 10).
 From a preoperative value of 92 +/- 13 ng/ml, C3a des-Arg rose during CPB to a maximum of 1816 +/- 393 at the end of CPB.

 We used a monoclonal antibody specifically reactive with the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor to localize this receptor immunohistochemically in frozen sections of normal ovary and epithelial ovarian cancer.
 Normal ovarian epithelium was found to express epidermal growth factor receptor in all cases.
 Among 87 ovarian cancers, however, 23% did not express immunohistochemically detectable receptor.
 Epidermal growth factor receptor expression was not related to histologic grade or stage, but was associated with poor survival (p less than 0.05).
 The median length of survival of patients with tumors that did not express epidermal growth factor receptor was 40 months compared with 26 months in patients with tumors that did express epidermal growth factor receptor.

 The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on stroke volume (SV) at increasing submaximal exercise intensities was studied in 12 endurance-trained normotensive and 12 untrained hypertensive (diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg) men, aged 18 to 34 years.
 Subjects were assigned to each of 3 treatments in a double-blind, randomized order: placebo, propranolol (80 mg twice daily) and pindolol (10 mg twice daily) for 10 days, with a period of 48 to 60 hours from the initial dose to the first treadmill test and a 4-day washout period between drugs.
 Cardiac output was measured using the carbon dioxide rebreathing method and SV was calculated from cardiac output and heart rate as follows: SV = cardiac output/heart rate.
 Cardiac outputs were estimated at rest and while walking on a treadmill at 25, 45, 60 and 75% of the subject's previously determined maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max).
 No significant differences were found in cardiac output between either of the drugs and placebo at rest, or at any of the 4 rates of work.
 Propranolol significantly increased SV above placebo values (p less than 0.05) for both trained and untrained groups at the intensities of 45, 60 and 75%.
 Significant differences in SV were found between pindolol and placebo only at the intensities of 60 and 75% in the trained group.
 Contrary to expectations, SV showed no indication of a plateau with propranolol in the trained subjects throughout the 4 different exercise intensities, whereas a plateau was established under placebo conditions by 45% of VO2max in both trained and untrained subjects.

 The motor-evoked potentials were reevaluated in 16 of the 53 patients after substantial reduction of antiepileptic drug doses.
 The objective was to assess the effect of epilepsy and of anticonvulsant medication on the central motor system.
 In subjects receiving antiepileptic treatment, cortical threshold intensities were markedly elevated and peripheral latencies were prolonged.
 Cortical threshold intensities and peripheral latencies decreased to approach control values after anticonvulsant medication was reduced but were increased in patients treated with 2 or 3 anticonvulsant agents instead of 1.
 Additionally, high levels of interictal epileptiform activity and a high frequency of seizures significantly decreased the central motor conduction time and, in part, threshold intensities.
 The central motor conduction time was further diminished after reduction of anticonvulsant treatment and increased when several drugs were administered.
 The duration of epilepsy, the location of the epileptic focus, and the type of the epileptic seizure did not affect motor-evoked potentials.
 Conclusively, central motor pathways are endogenously facilitated by epileptiform activity even if clinical signs of their involvement are absent.
 Anticonvulsant medication exerts major reversible effects on magnetic motor-evoked potentials.

771,"Recruitment of mononuclear cells by endothelial cell binding into wounded skin is a selective, time-dependent process with defined molecular interactions.
 Wound healing involves a complex series of interactions between cells in the dermis and epidermis, and important relationships exist between keratinocytes and resident dermal cells.
 Monocytes and lymphocytes secrete cytokines that are capable of stimulating dermal repair and influencing keratinocyte and fibroblast migration and proliferation, although the mechanism by which mononuclear cells are recruited into the wound is unknown.
 We have tested the hypothesis that in wounded skin specialized endothelial cells are induced to mediate peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) emigration from the vasculature into the dermis.
 For this purpose, partial-thickness wounds made with a keratome on the backs of domestic pigs were excised 0 to 9, 12, 15, and 21 d after wounding.
 The biopsies were then tested for the capacity to adhere selectively to PBMC.
 The results indicated that PBMC overlaid onto sections of wounds from day 4 to 15 adhered selectively to dermal endothelium, with two distinct peaks of adherence observed on day 7 and day 12.
 In contrast, PBMC did not adhere to the tissue sections when overlaid onto frozen sections of normal skin or 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, and 21-d-old wounded skin.
 Additional studies on the binding properties of PBMC subsets revealed that monocytes adhered maximally at day 7, whereas T cells adhered optimally at day 12 post-wounding.
 Furthermore, the adhesion process was energy and magnesium dependent but not calcium dependent and involved surface protein and carbohydrate moieties on PBMC surface.
 Pre-treatment of PBMC with monoclonal antibodies against the LFA-1 adhesive receptors inhibited the binding by greater than 80%, suggesting that LFA-1 adhesive receptors play an important role in the binding process.
 These studies provide evidence that the recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes into wounds is an active, dynamic, and regulated process mediated at least in part by specific adhesive interactions between mononuclear leukocytes and dermal endothelial cells.

 The effect of intravenous streptokinase therapy on the time course of functional recovery was investigated in a controlled study of 64 patients randomized within 3 hours after the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
 Contrast ventriculography was performed 1 to 4 days after AMI and repeated 5 weeks later.
 Wall motion was analyzed by the centerline method in the central infarct, peripheral infarct and noninfarct regions.
 In patients with ventriculographic data at the early catheterization, streptokinase-treated patients had less severe hypokinesia in the central infarct region than control patients (-2.9 +/- 0.9 [n = 29] vs -3.4 +/- 0.7 standard deviations below normal [n = 21], p less than 0.05).
 The benefit of streptokinase was more marked in the peripheral infarct region (-1.5 +/- 0.7 vs -2.1 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.001).
 As a result, the ejection fraction was slightly higher in treated versus control groups (46 +/- 10 vs 43 +/- 7%, respectively; difference not significant).
 At 5 weeks, function in the streptokinase and control groups had diverged further because of continued improvement in the streptokinase-treated patients.
 This study shows that streptokinase benefits left ventricular (LV) function by 1 to 4 days after AMI, earlier than previously reported.
 The benefit was not limited to the peripheral infarct region, where ischemia might have been less severe, but was also seen in the central infarct region.
 The implication is that thrombolytic therapy can improve LV function during the period of myocardial stunning, while myocardial function is still recovering.

 OBJECTIVE--To investigate the relation between ventilatory function and subsequent mortality due to cerebrovascular disease.
 DESIGN--Prospective longitudinal study.
 SUBJECTS--A total of 18,403 male civil servants aged 40-64 years at entry examination for the Whitehall study.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Mortality from cerebrovascular disease (ICD8 430-438) after 18 years of follow up.
 RESULTS--In all, 262 men with sinus rhythm at entry died due to stroke during the 18 years of follow up.
 Compared with men with a forced expiratory volume in one second of greater than or equal to 3.5 litres those with a value of less than 3.0 litres were almost twice as likely to die of cerebrovascular disease (rate ratio adjusted for age and systolic blood pressure = 1.88, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.69).
 This increased risk occurred within each tertile of systolic blood pressure.
 Nested case-control analyses were used to control precisely for confounding effects of age, height, and smoking (by matching) and employment grade and physiological risk factors (by modelling).
 The effect of forced expiratory volume in one second was independent of age, height, smoking habits, employment grade, blood pressure, weight, cholesterol concentration, glucose tolerance, electrocardiographic abnormalities, history of chest pain, and history of intermittent claudication.
 CONCLUSIONS--Measurements of ventilatory function may assist clinical decisions about whether to treat mild hypertension.

 The wall motion in Group IIIa was worse than Group II but better than Group IIIb.
 Group IIIa showed Q-wave on ECG more often (69%) than Group II (27%) (p less than 0.01), but less often than Group IIIb (85%) (p less than 0.05).
 These data indicate that the reinjection 201Tl imaging often identifies new fill-in in the areas of no redistribution on the delayed images and it may hold promise for assessing tissue viability which the conventional imaging may underestimate.

 The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of doxazosin and enalapril were compared in the general practice setting (n = 54).
 Both agents produced comparable, statistically significant (p less than 0.05) reductions in mean blood pressure with no clinically relevant changes in heart rate.
 Side effects in the two groups were mild or moderate and disappeared or were tolerated with continued treatment.
 Doxazosin, in contrast to enalapril, produced a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in the total serum cholesterol concentration, a reduction in the level of triglycerides, and a favorable increase in the high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio.
 The reduction in calculated coronary heart disease risk produced by doxazosin (-27.58%) was highly significant (p less than 0.0002) and greater than that produced by enalapril (-18.49% p less than 0.02).

778,"Dietary calcium, vascular reactivity, and genetic hypertension in the Lyon rat strain.
 In order to examine the relationship existing between dietary calcium and the development of hypertension, we developed a long-term study in the Lyon hypertensive rat strain (LH) and two control strains, the Lyon normotensive (LN) and low blood pressure rats (LL) given enriched (HCa, 2.5%), deprived (LCa, 0.03%) and normal (NCa, 0.6%) calcium diets.
 Evolution of body weight, systolic blood pressure (BP), plasma calcium and magnesium was monitored from 4 to 23 weeks of age.
 Total cardiovascular reactivity and contractile response of isolated aorta to norepinephrine were measured at 23 weeks of age.
 LH rats on HCa diet failed to develop hypertension (BP less than 150 mm Hg) whereas LH rats on LCa diet exhibited higher blood pressure levels than their controls fed the NCa diet.
 Moreover, in LN rats HCa diet slightly decreased BP whereas LCa had no effect.
 In the LL rats, on the contrary, only LCa diet slightly increased BP.
 In vivo responsiveness to NE was significantly higher in LH compared to LL and LN rats fed a NCa diet.
 HCa and LCa diets both induced a significant decrease in this response in LH rats.
 HCa diet increased the response in LN rats but decreased it in LL.
 In contrast, at the same age, the in vitro contractile response of isolated aorta to NE was significantly decreased in LH compared to LN and LL rats receiving NCa diet.
 Moreover in LH and LN rats on HCa diet the contractile response was markedly increased but no significant difference was observed with LCa diet.

779,"Risk factors and manifestations of digoxin toxicity in the elderly.
 The incidence of digoxin toxicity increases with age, largely because the two most common conditions that benefit from use of digoxin, congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation, are markedly more prevalent in old age.
 Whether the elderly are more sensitive to the effects of digoxin because of age per se is unclear.
 However, several other factors render the elderly more susceptible to digoxin toxicity.
 These include an age-related decline in renal function and a decrease in volume of digoxin distribution.
 There is also an increase in the number of comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which heighten susceptibility to digoxin toxicity.
 Moreover, treatment of these diseases with such interactive medications as quinidine and calcium channel blockers may increase the serum level of digoxin.
 Similarly, such electrolyte imbalances as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia occur more frequently in the elderly as a result of diuretic therapy.
 However, recent data suggest that manifestations of digoxin toxicity among younger and older patients do not differ.
 Similar incidences of cardiac toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and altered mental status are found in both patient populations.
 Treatment of digitalis toxicity in the elderly is the same as for younger patients.
 Response rates to Digibind are not diminished in the elderly.

 We performed a retrospective study to determine the sensitivity of mammography in detecting breast cancer arising in women with augmented breasts.
 Of eight women with breast implants in whom breast cancer developed, six had mammograms before biopsy.
 Only two of the six cancers were identified mammographically (sensitivity = 33%), and one of these two was seen only in retrospect.
 In both cases, the mammographic findings suggested a benign rather than a malignant process.
 All eight women had a palpable mass and early disease, and all are clinically disease-free at present.
 The sensitivity of mammography in detecting palpable cancers in a control group of women without implants was 92% (118 of 128).
 For tumors of 2 cm or less, the sensitivity was 88% (58 of 66).
 These results suggest that the sensitivity of mammography in detecting breast cancer is decreased when implants are present.
 Further investigations are needed to determine the effects of prostheses on mammographic evaluations.

781,"Crural artery bypass with adjunctive arteriovenous fistula. A modification in distal anastomosis.
 We carried out crural artery bypass with an adjunctive arteriovenous fistula in 8 lower extremities of 7 patients with severe ischemic symptoms and poor distal run-off.
 Mean blood flow rates in the implanted grafts ranged from 43 to 340 ml/min and those of the reconstructed crural arteries from 20 to 100 ml/min.
 A stenotic lesion was noted on postoperative angiogram in one patient and stasis symptoms caused by downward blood flow into the distal veins in another.
 The other patients have remained well with good function of the grafts 1-5 years after surgery.
 We modified the distal corner of the anastomosis as follows: three additional interrupted simple sutures were made on the anterior wall of the concomitant arteriotomy and venotomy incisions after making the common posterior wall of the vessel incisions.
 A vascular pocket formed at the distal corner of the anastomosis prevents stricture at the anastomosis.
 The vein is finally ligated just distal to the fistula to intercept downward blood flow into the distal veins.
 This modification in technique is recommended to prevent stricture of the distal anastomosis and postoperative stasis symptoms.

 A new, miniature cesium iodide/photodiode nuclear probe (the ""Cardioscint"") has been developed for continuous on-line measurement of left ventricular function and the ST-segment.
 Ejection fraction (EF) measurements in 77 patients were compared with gated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculograms.
 The probe was positioned over the left ventricle by first using a blind positioning algorithm and then by using the gamma camera.
 Background was measured both manually and automatically.
 There was good correlation between probe (positioned blind) and gamma camera EF with both manual (r = 0.80, n = 65) and automatic (r = 0.78, n = 66) backgrounds.
 Use of the gamma camera did not significantly alter the results.
 Correlation between the probe stroke counts and thermodilution-derived stroke index during atrial pacing in six subjects was also satisfactory (r = 0.69, n = 102).
 Thus, the Cardioscint is able to provide a reliable estimate of EF and can track rapid changes in cardiac volumes.

 A retrospective analysis of the long-term results of using the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial bioprosthesis in the tricuspid position was carried out on 73 patients (8 men, 65 women).
 Of these procedures, ten were tricuspid valve replacement alone and the remainder were in combination with other valve procedures.
 The mean follow-up was 9.6 years (range, 4 to 18 years).
 The mean age of the patients was 53 years (range, 27 to 78 years).
 Seventy-one of the patients suffered tricuspid valve dysfunction from rheumatic heart disease.
 There were 13 postoperative deaths (within 30 days), giving a mortality rate of 17.8%.
 The actuarial survival at 10 years was 71% +/- 4.2%.
 Of the survivors, 49 (79.6%) were in functional class I or II.
 Primary tissue valve failure in the tricuspid position occurred in 1 patient 12 years after implantation and required reoperation.
 In another patient bioprosthetic tricuspid valve endocarditis developed.
 There was no incidence of thromboembolic complications.
 We conclude that the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial bioprosthesis was a satisfactory prosthesis in the tricuspid position in patients with acquired valvar dysfunction.

 Indium-111- (111In) labeled murine monoclonal antibodies ZCE 025 (against carcinoembryonic antigen) and CYT-103 MAb B72.3 (against tumor-associated glycoprotein - 72) have been used to image patients with colorectal cancers with encouraging results.
 The objectives of this study were to assess the frequency and causes of 111In MAb localization in tumor-free, benign tissues.
 Thus, scans of 75 patients who have undergone exploratory surgery following radioimmunoscintigraphy with 111In-ZCE 025 (n = 37) or 111In-CYT-103 (n = 38) were reviewed in conjunction with operative and histopathology reports.
 Localization in non-tumored tissues was seen in 10.8% and 13.1%, respectively, of patients receiving ZCE 025 and CYT-103.
 The most common sites involved were: degenerative joint disease, abdominal aneurysms, postoperative bowel adhesions, and local inflammatory changes secondary to surgery or external irradiation.

 It has also outlined other aspects of rehabilitation, the use of continuous passive motion devices, and other forms of exercises and training that, together with bracing, may enhance patient recovery.
 Continuous passive motion devices have been used for many different orthopedic problems with good success.
 Understanding the mechanics of how these devices move the knee and the forces that can be applied to the knee is helpful in deciding on their use after ligamentous reconstructions.
 Rehabilitation of the knee following surgery requires a good understanding of the effects that each exercise has on the knee and the reconstruction.
 Gradual progression of exercises to the knee following knee ligament reconstruction will not overstress healing tissues.
 Many different types of knee braces exist, and careful evaluation of them may enhance patient recovery.

786,"Pulmonary effects of ischemic limb reperfusion: evidence for a role for oxygen-derived radicals.
 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the lung as a reperfusion target after limb ischemia-reperfusion, and to measure specifically the oxygen radical response to this reperfusion.
 DESIGN: Paired simple randomized, with continuous interval data in dependent variable and both continuous and nominal independent variables.
 SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTION: Sprague-Dawley male rats (n = 195) were anesthetized and both hind limbs occluded for 3.75 hr, the overnight LD50.
 Alveolar lavage was performed on the animals 1 hr after reperfusion or on survivors 20 hr after reperfusion.
 Groups were either undosed or pretreated with alpha-tocopherol as an antioxidant (50 mg/kg.day) 2 days before ischemia.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence was measured in both phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated and unstimulated macrophages.
 Nanomoles of superoxide radicals per 10(6) alveolar cells/min were also measured using a cytochrome c reduction assay.
 A significant (p less than .01, Student's t-test), time-dependent increase in response of cells from ischemic-reperfused rats was seen.
 Pretreatment with antioxidant had no effect at 1 hr, but significant differences were seen in the 20-hr survivors.
 CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that alveolar lavage cells, 95% macrophages, reflect the reperfusion of ischemic-reperfused hind limbs by a significant increase in oxygen radical activity, an effect partly suppressed in antioxidant-dosed survivors.

 The effect of diltiazem on long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was assessed in 2,377 patients enrolled in the Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial and subsequently followed for 25 +/- 8 months.
 The study population included 855 patients (36%) with at least 1 prior AMI before the index infarction and 1,522 patients (64%) with a first AMI, of whom 409 (27%) had a first non-Q-wave AMI, 664 (44%) a first inferior Q-wave AMI, and 449 (30%) a first anterior Q-wave AMI.
 This post hoc analysis revealed that, among patients with first non-Q-wave and first inferior Q-wave AMI, there were fewer cardiac events during follow-up in the diltiazem than in the placebo group, and that the reverse was true for patients with first anterior Q-wave AMI or prior infarction.
 The diltiazem:placebo Cox hazard ratio (95% confidence limits) for the trial primary end point (cardiac death or nonfatal reinfarction, whichever occurred first) was: first non-Q-wave AMI-0.48 (0.26, 0.89); first inferior Q-wave AMI-0.66 (0.40, 1.09); first anterior Q-wave AMI-0.82 (0.51, 1.31); and prior AMI-1.11 (0.85, 1.44).
 Use of cardiac death alone as an end point gave an even more sharply focused treatment difference: first non-Q-wave AMI-0.46 (0.18, 1.21); first inferior Q-wave AMI-0.53 (0.27, 1.06); first anterior Q-wave AMI-1.28 (0.68, 2.40); prior infarction-1.26 (0.90, 1.77).

788,"Flow-volume characteristics in the pulmonary circulation.
 Isolated ferret and canine lungs were used to validate a method for assessing determinants of vascular volume in the pulmonary circulation.
 With left atrial pressure (Pla) constant at 5 mmHg, flow (Q) was raised in steps over a physiological range.
 Changes in vascular volume (delta V) with each increment in Q were determined as the opposite of changes in perfusion system reservoir weight or from the increase in lung weight.
 At each level of Q, the pulmonary arterial and left atrial cannulas were simultaneously occluded, allowing all vascular pressures to equilibrate at the same static pressure (Ps), which was equal to the compliance-weighted average pressure in the circulation before occlusion.
 Hypoxia (inspired PO2 25 Torr) in ferret lungs, which causes intense constriction in arterial extra-alveolar vessels, had no effect on the slope of the Ps-Q relationship, interpreted to represent the resistance downstream from compliance (control 0.025 +/- 0.006 mmHg.ml-1.min, hypoxia 0.030 +/- 0.013).
 The Ps-axis intercept increased from 8.94 +/- 0.50 to 13.43 +/- 1.52 mmHg, indicating a modest increase in the effective back-pressure to flow downstream from compliant regions.
 The compliance of the circulation, obtained from the slope of the relationship between delta V and Ps, was unaffected by hypoxia (control 0.52 +/- 0.08 ml/mmHg, hypoxia 0.56 +/- 0.08).
 In contrast, histamine in canine lungs, which causes constriction in veins, caused the slope of the Ps-Q relationship to increase from 0.013 +/- 0.007 to 0.032 +/- 0.006 mmHg.ml-1.min (P less than 0.05) and the compliance to decrease from 3.51 +/- 0.56 to 1.68 +/- 0.37 ml/mmHg (P less than 0.05).

790,"Prognostic significance of valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis.
 PURPOSE: Doppler ultrasound is a sensitive modality for detecting and quantitating valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis.
 Because valvular regurgitation leads to heart failure, we evaluated the prognostic significance of Doppler-detected valvular regurgitation in patients with endocarditis who had not yet developed clinical heart failure.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 65 patients with a clinical diagnosis of infective endocarditis from May 1985 to March 1990.
 A total of 49 patients were included in the study: 33 patients with native valve endocarditis and 16 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis.
 The initial Doppler echocardiogram was examined in these patients to determine the presence and degree of valvular regurgitation.
 RESULTS: Significant (moderate to severe) valvular regurgitation was detected in 23 (47%) patients.
 The presence or absence of significant valvular regurgitation did not predict the development of congestive heart failure, the need for surgery, or death (p = NS).
 The development of congestive heart failure was significantly associated with the need for surgery (p less than 0.0001) and death (p less than 0.05).
 CONCLUSION: We conclude that the detection of significant valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis who have not yet developed heart failure is not predictive of future complications nor does the absence of significant valvular regurgitation identify a group of patients with a more favorable prognosis.
 In our series, patients who developed congestive heart failure had a significantly higher incidence of surgery and death.
 Therefore, decisions regarding clinical management in patients with infective endocarditis should not be made solely on the presence or absence of echocardiographically detected valvular regurgitation.

 Surgical experience with carcinomas of the uterus and rectum has provided new insights into the surgical anatomy of a lamina, which separates the paravesical space from the pararectal space.
 It has been proved that each of the lamina consists of the cardinal and lateral ligaments and pelvic splanchnic nerves, descending in the following order.
 The cardinal and lateral ligaments, as a connective stalk, insert into the lateral walls of the uterus and rectum extending from the inner aspect of the pelvic wall.
 Clarification of this structural relationship led to the development of a new procedure for the dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy, while still preserving the lateral ligament.
 This facilitated systematic dissection of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments with posterior manipulation, leading to a reduction in blood loss and to prevention of brisk bleeding from the venous plexuses.

 Clinical study of carotid artery laser endarterectomy began April 15, 1988.
 This report describes the first 10 cases that were performed in nine patients (five men and four women, mean age 70 years).
 Indications were asymptomatic stenosis (5), transient ischemic attacks (4), and stroke in evolution (1).
 There were two emergency cases and eight elective cases (including one reoperative case).
 Surgical exposure, systemic heparinization, vascular control, and a longitudinal arteriotomy were used.
 The cleavage plane between atheromas and media was developed with argon ion laser radiation (488 and 514.5 nm) directed through a 300 microns quartz fiber at power 1.0 W.
 Laser radiation was used to cut the atheromas out of the arteries and weld the end points.
 Residual atheromatous debris were vaporized with individual laser exposures.
 Arteriotomies were closed with sutures, and blood flow was restored.
 The endarterectomies were 3.9 +/- 1.1 cm long and required 330 +/- 97 joules.
 Mean clamp time was 22.5 +/- 7.9 minutes.
 Shunts were used in two cases.
 There were no arterial perforations or injuries as a result of laser light.
 Complications were hematoma (1), respiratory arrest (1), and transient neurologic deficit (1).

793,"Transmural myocardial deformation in the ischemic canine left ventricle.
 The myocardium is a complex three-dimensional structure consisting of myocytes interconnected by a dense collagen weave that courses in different directions.
 Regional ischemia can be expected to produce complex changes in ventricular deformation.
 In the present study, we examined the effects of ischemia on two- and three-dimensional finite strains during acute transmural myocardial ischemia in 13 open-chest anesthetized dogs.
 In contrast to systolic deformation observed during the control period in which circumferential shortening exceeded longitudinal shortening, our results indicate that after 5 minutes of acute ischemia, end-systolic in-plane lengthening across the left ventricular wall occurs in approximately equal amounts in the circumferential and longitudinal directions.
 Along with these changes in extensional strains, there were significant negative transverse shearing deformations during ischemia.
 Myocardial ischemia also resulted in a loss of the normal end-systolic transmural gradients of shortening and thickening.
 Three-dimensional end-diastolic strains indicate that the left ventricular wall undergoes a significant passive reconfiguration that varies transmurally with lengthening in the epicardial tangent plane and wall thinning increasing from the epicardium toward the endocardium.
 The large systolic changes in shearing deformations with ischemia could potentially influence collateral blood flow and certainly indicate that uniaxial measurements of deformation in the ischemic myocardium, which do not account for shearing deformation, are incomplete and must be interpreted with caution.
 Moreover, normal transmural systolic gradients in deformation, which would be anticipated on geometric grounds, are lost during ischemia, implying that the material properties of ischemic tissue or the loading conditions imposed on the ischemic region by partially impaired adjacent myocardium vary transmurally.

 The patients presented after the 1st year of life and had not undergone surgical intervention.
 All except one were in functional class II.
 No patient had preexcitation on the surface ECG, but abnormal tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias were seen in five patients on 24 h ECG monitoring.
 Subnormal exercise performance was observed in five patients.
 Echocardiography demonstrated typical variable tricuspid valve displacement and paradoxic interventricular septal motion.
 Left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions were normal in all patients, but posterior wall motion was reduced in two.
 Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation with a Doppler jet velocity less than 2.5 m/s was demonstrated in eight patients.
 Left ventricular radionuclide scintigraphy revealed a subnormal ejection fraction (less than 50%) in 5 of 10 patients; these 5 had previously shown suboptimal exercise performance.
 The two youngest patients (less than 15 years) had no arrhythmia, normal exercise performance and normal left ventricular ejection fraction.
 There was no correlation between the degree of tricuspid valve displacement or regurgitation and the presence of rhythm disturbance, exercise performance or radionuclide left ventricular function.
 Late evaluation of patients with Ebstein's anomaly may demonstrate significant unsuspected abnormalities in cardiac rhythm, exercise performance and left ventricular function.

 To determine how well physical examination findings suggestive of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) correlate with echocardiographic evidence of MVP, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 104 patients referred to an Air Force Cardiology Clinic for echocardiography to rule out MVP.
 In each case, the referring physician's specialty and his findings on cardiac physical examination were recorded.
 All patients had M-mode echocardiography, and half of the patients had two-dimensional echocardiography.
 Sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios for the physical examination were calculated using echocardiography as the comparison standard.
 The combination of a systolic click and a systolic murmur was the physical examination finding most predictive of echocardiographic MVP, with a positive likelihood ratio of 2.43.
 Other combinations of physical findings yielded likelihood ratios close to 1.
 No differences were found based on the specialty of the examining physician.
 We conclude that when practicing physicians find a systolic click and murmur, MVP is likely to be present on echocardiography, though one third of the patients will have normal echocardiograms.
 Other combinations of physical findings are of little help in predicting echocardiographic MVP.

 In an exploratory study of 1031 persons observed to progress from normotension to essential hypertension and 1031 matched subjects who remained normotensive, the initial leukocyte count (WBC) was found to be related to the development of hypertension, with risk increased 40% (95% confidence interval 12-82%) in persons in the highest as compared to the lowest quartile of WBC.
 This relationship proved to be largely independent of body mass index, body fat distribution, alcohol and tobacco consumption, and parental history of hypertension.
 An increased WBC may reflect greater sympathetic tone or may directly increase peripheral vascular resistance by impeding circulation through small blood vessels.
 If confirmed, this study adds another condition to the growing list for which the WBC is predictive.

 Fifty eight consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were given 30 U of anistreplase intravenously within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms.
 A fall in the plasma concentration fibrinogen to less than 1.0 g/l 90 minutes after administration of anistreplase was considered to reflect a systemic lytic state.

 Patency rates were significantly different in patients with a systemic lytic (83% (43/52)) and a systemic non-lytic state (0% (0/6)).
 The absence of a systemic lytic state after anistreplase administration seemed to be highly predictive of the failure of coronary thrombolysis.

 Axillary and rectal temperatures were obtained with an electronic thermistor probe (Diatek 500), and tympanic membrane temperatures were obtained with a noncontact, infrared sensing device (First TEMP).
 Patients were stratified by age, ear canal patency, presence of otitis media, and rectal temperature.
 RESULTS: Of 224 patients enrolled, 87 (39%) were febrile.
 Overall correlation of axillary and tympanic membrane measurements to rectal for all strata was .75 (P = .001) and .81 (P = .001), respectively.

 BACKGROUND.
 Abnormalities in coronary blood flow are responsible for stress-induced reductions in contractile function in pressure overload hypertrophy.
 Less is known about coronary blood flow in volume overload.
 In this study, we tested the hypothesis that coronary blood flow abnormalities were responsible for contractile abnormalities in experimental volume overload hypertrophy.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 We examined coronary blood flow at rest and during pacing in seven dogs with contractile dysfunction secondary to chronic experimental mitral regurgitation (average regurgitant fraction at 3 months, 0.58 +/- 0.05).
 After 3 months of mitral regurgitation, left ventricular mass had increased from 92 +/- 8 g at baseline to 118 +/- 10 g (p less than 0.002).
 The slope of the end-ejection stress-volume relation, one of our indexes used to estimate contractile function, had fallen from 5.4 +/- 0.3 at baseline to 3.0 +/- 0.3 at 3 months of mitral regurgitation (p less than 0.001).
 In the mitral regurgitation dogs, coronary blood flow at rest was similar to that of control dogs (endocardial blood flow: control dogs, 1.33 +/- 0.12 ml/min/g; mitral regurgitation dogs, 1.16 ml/min/g, p = NS; epicardial blood flow at rest: control dogs, 1.30 +/- 0.16 ml/min/g; mitral regurgitation dogs 1.13 +/- 0.2 ml/min/g, p = NS).
 With pacing-induced stress, coronary blood flow increased appropriately in control and mitral regurgitation dogs.
 Ultrasonic dimension gauges placed in the endocardium and epicardium demonstrated no further deterioration in ventricular function during pacing in the mitral regurgitation dogs.
 In a separate group of five control dogs and five dogs with mitral regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction, coronary blood flow was examined in the conscious closed-chest state at rest, during adenosine infusion, and during rapid atrial pacing (240 beats/min).
 Blood flow increased similarly in both groups during pacing and adenosine infusion.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 We conclude that in dogs with mitral regurgitation that have developed contractile dysfunction, abnormalities in coronary blood flow do not explain the resting contractile dysfunction.
 Furthermore, studies during pacing-induced stress and coronary vasodilation with adenosine demonstrate that substantial coronary blood flow reserve is present in this type of volume overload hypertrophy.

801,"The role of diencephalic pathology in human memory disorder. Evidence from a penetrating paranasal brain injury.
 A patient (B.J.) is reported who developed severe memory impairment following a penetrating brain injury caused by a snooker cue which entered through his left nostril into the basal regions of the brain.
 Initially, his memory disorder had the clinical features of a dense amnesic syndrome, with both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, but B.J.
 subsequently showed significant recovery of memory function.
 Formal memory testing was carried out 21 months after injury.
 This demonstrated marked verbal memory impairment, as severe as that seen in patients with the amnesic syndrome.
 On nonverbal memory tests, his impairment was relatively mild and patchy.
 His retrograde amnesia had regressed mainly to affect a 6 month period before the injury.
 On other cognitive tasks, he performed at an average or above average level, and there was no neuropsychological evidence of frontal lobe dysfunction.
 Neuroradiological investigations at various stages after his injury failed to demonstrate a lesion in any of the thalamic nuclei.
 Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion in the hypothalamus in the region of the mamillary bodies.
 Our study demonstrates that marked, relatively focal, memory disorder after diencephalic injury can occur without direct pathology to the body of the thalamus.
 It also indicates that structures in or adjacent to the hypothalamus, such as the mamillary bodies, may play a more important role in human memory functioning than has hitherto been considered.

 Research on the relevance of social support to cancer has been plentiful since the first American Cancer Society workshop on methodological issues in behavioral and psychosocial science.
 Nonetheless, critical shortcomings continue to characterize the attempt empirically to establish such things as the extent to which social support predicts adjustment to cancer diagnosis and treatment.
 Prominent among these is the failure to adequately address large elements of the social structure, such as social class and urbanization, and to investigate how they shape the well being of persons with or at risk for cancer and their caregivers.
 We recommend that more psychosocial research on the link between social support and cancer be conducted within populations beset by poverty and without adequate access to health care.

804,"Intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia resulting from compound heterozygosity of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutations.
 Four subjects with thermolabile methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were discovered among 16 ""obligate"" heterozygotes for severe MTHFR deficiency and their family members.
 All four subjects had less than 25% of normal mean MTHFR specific activity in lymphocyte extracts.
 Three of them with normal serum folate and cyanocobalamin had intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia, and one with high serum folate and cyanocobalamin had no excessive accumulation of serum homocysteine.
 The biochemical features in these four subjects are distinguishable from subjects homozygous for the thermolabile MTHFR, whose specific activity is approximately 50% of the normal mean, and from heterozygotes for severe MTHFR deficiency, in whom the enzyme is thermostable and has a specific activity of about 50% of the normal mean.
 We propose that these four subjects are genetic compounds of the allele for the severe mutation and the allele for thermolabile mutation of the MTHFR gene.
 It is postulated that subjects with this genetic compound are more susceptible to the development of intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia despite normal folate and B12 levels.
 Nonetheless, hyperhomocysteinemia due to this compound heterozygosity is correctable by oral folic acid therapy.

805,"Hemodynamic profiles of prostaglandin E1, isoproterenol, prostacyclin, and nifedipine in experimental porcine pulmonary hypertension.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We compared the hemodynamic effects of four vasodilators in experimental embolic pulmonary hypertension in a randomized controlled trial, using nine pigs weighing 16 to 23 kg.
 After anesthesia induction and cannulation with arterial, central venous, and thermodilution output pulmonary artery catheters, animals were repetitively embolized with glass beads (60 to 160 mu) in order to establish pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] doubled from baseline).
 Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), isoproterenol, prostacyclin (PGI2), and nifedipine were compared at doses producing equivalent reduction in systemic BP.
 RESULTS: Only PGE1 and PGI2 decreased both PAP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).
 PGE1 decreased PAP from 39 +/- 1 to 33 +/- 1 mm Hg; prostacyclin decreased PAP from 38 +/- 1 to 31 +/- 1 mm Hg and produced the largest increase in cardiac output (Qt).
 Isoproterenol did not change PAP, markedly increased heart rate (162 +/- 8 to 216 +/- 11 beats/min), and resulted in significant arrhythmias.
 Nifedipine increased PVR from 1044 +/- 113 to 1125 +/- 100 dyne.sec.cm-5 and decreased Qt.
 CONCLUSIONS: Vasodilators demonstrate unique hemodynamic drug profiles.
 Isoproterenol infusion is characterized by tachycardia and arrhythmias.
 Both PGE1 and PGI2 effectively decrease PAP and PVR.
 Nifedipine depressed Qt significantly in this glass-bead embolization model of acute pulmonary hypertension.

 Mass closure of midline incisions with a running large-bore permanent monofilament polypropylene suture has been used in general surgery and gynecology patients with a reported small incidence of fascial dehiscence.
 Late-occurring wound sinus formation is one problem reported with the use of this permanent suture material.
 Over a 22-month period, 285 patients had midline incisions closed with a continuous, running no.
 1 polyglyconate monofilament delayed absorbable suture.
 Closely spaced bites (about 1.5 cm apart) were taken and placed 2 cm lateral to the fascial edge.
 Over 60% of the patients had surgery because of gynecologic cancer.
 Other high-risk factors included obesity in 62%, diabetes in 19%, and previous irradiation or chemotherapy in 22%.
 An ovarian cancer staging procedure was done in 16% of the patients.
 Of the remaining patients, almost half had extensive operative procedures that ranged from exenterations to hysterectomies with lymph node dissection.
 Wound complications were noted in nine patients (3.2%).
 Seven had superficial infections, one had an evisceration, and one developed a ventral hernia.
 Wound sinuses did not occur.
 The closure technique is safe and expedient and distributes tension equally over a continuous line.
 It has the additional advantage of eventual absorption of the suture material, thereby avoiding the wound sinus problems occasionally reported with large-bore permanent sutures.

807,"Cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in patients with vascular dementia of the Binswanger type.
 We performed clinical and neuroradiologic studies, including positron emission tomography, in five patients with vascular dementia of the Binswanger type.
 The clinical features of these cases consisted of slowly progressive dementia, together with vascular risk factors such as hypertension and often a history of minor stroke, and characteristic white matter lesions on brain computed tomograms or magnetic resonance images.
 Digital subtraction angiography of the cervical and intracranial arteries demonstrated no occlusive lesion in any patient.
 Both cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were markedly reduced in the white matter (54-77% of control values), and both were decreased in the parietal (73% of control), frontal (74-80%), and temporal (74-83%) cortices, where no abnormalities were detected by brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.
 We conclude that vascular dementia of the Binswanger type may be caused by disconnection between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures due to ischemic damage in the white matter.

808,"Corticotropin-releasing factor modulates the immune response to stress in the rat.
 We examined the role of CRF, a key mediator of the endocrine response to stress, in modulating immunosuppression during the subacute stress of intermittent electrical shock over 1 h.
 Administration of shock to intact rats resulted in a 74% decrement in T-lymphocyte proliferation and a 59% decrease in natural killer cytotoxicity.
 Similar suppression of these two parameters of immune function in response to shock was noted in adrenalectomized rats as well.
 The immunosuppressive effects of this shock were significantly and comparably blunted when both intact and adrenalectomized animals were pretreated 1) iv with either a highly potent polyclonal CRF antibody or a specific CRF antagonist or 2) intracerebroventricularly with either a high affinity monoclonal antibody to CRF or a specific CRF antagonist.
 An immunomodulatory role for CRF is further supported by the findings that administration of exogenous CRF, either iv (10 micrograms/animal) or intracerebroventricularly (1 microgram/animal), resulted in significant decrements in lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer cytotoxicity, similar to those seen with the stress paradigm.
 Our observations indicate that CRF plays a significant role in modulating the immune response to subacute stress, largely by adrenal-independent mechanisms.

810,"Vasodilatory beta-blockers: systemic and regional hemodynamic effects.
 The systemic and regional hemodynamic alterations in hypertension and of the beta-adrenergic receptor inhibiting agents are reviewed.
 Hemodynamically, hypertension may be regarded as persistent elevation of arterial pressure associated with increased total peripheral resistance.
 In early or mild essential hypertension, however, increased total peripheral resistance may not readily be recognized because of the overriding effect of increased cardiac output.
 Clearly, the hemodynamics of blood pressure control are complex, and the mechanisms of antihypertensive agents must be used appropriately.
 The early beta-blockers reduced heart rate and cardiac output immediately after intravenous administration without immediately reducing arterial pressure, and calculated total peripheral resistance was increased.
 With prolonged oral treatment, arterial pressure decreased while maintaining a reduced heart rate and cardiac output.
 Total peripheral resistance, however, remained elevated.
 Recent beta-blockers, such as celiprolol, provide an improved physiologic response by instantly reducing arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance without reducing heart rate or cardiac output or expanding intravascular volume.

 The present study investigates the nature of humoral component(s) generated in tumor-bearing hosts to induce immune dysfunction of T cells.
 Cell-free ascitic fluid and culture supernatant (SN) were obtained from the ascites and cultures allowing MH134 hepatoma cells to grow.
 These ascites and SN samples were tested for their abilities to influence the generation of CTL responses to TNP and alloantigens.
 The generation of the anti-TNP CTL responses that require self H-2-restricted CD4+ Th cells was markedly suppressed by addition of the ascites or SN under conditions in which these samples did not inhibit anti-allo CTL responses capable of using alternate pathways of allo-restricted CD4+ and CD8+ Th.
 The activation of CD8+ CTL precursors and CTL activity were also resistant to the ascites or SN.
 The ascites- or SN-induced suppressive effect to which CD4+ Th were most susceptible was found to be mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activity, because: 1) the TGF-beta activity was detected in the MH134 ascites and culture SN; 2) the suppression of CD4+ Th function required for anti-TNP CTL responses was almost completely prevented by addition of anti-TGF-beta antibody to cultures and; 3) rTGF-beta also induced similar patterns of immunosuppression to those observed by ascites or SN.
 These results indicate that TGF-beta produced by tumor cells induces deleterious effects on T cell, especially on the CD4+ Th subset, and provide an explanation for the molecular mechanism underlying the previously observed CD4+ Th-selective suppression in the tumor-bearing state.

 Twenty-three patients with angina who were undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization underwent cardiac pacing with simultaneous hemodynamic and Doppler echocardiographic evaluation to assess the effects of pacing-induced ischemic on mitral valve velocity.
 Seventeen patients had significant coronary artery disease, and six patients had normal coronary arteries.
 Doppler and hemodynamic measurements were performed at rest and immediately after pacing was discontinued to 91% +/- 7% of maximal predicted heart rate.
 Seven patients experienced new or significant increases in severity of mitral regurgitation after pacing as revealed by Doppler examination.
 This group had a significant increase (p = 0.007) in early but not in late peak filling velocities immediately after pacing was discontinued, with a resultant decrease in late to early ratios, which decreased from 1.01% +/- 0.12 to 0.70% +/- 0.19 (p = 0.006).
 Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased significantly from 16.7% +/- 6.8 mm Hg to 29.4% +/- 5.3 mm Hg after cardiac pacing (p less than 0.001).
 Patients with coronary disease who did not develop mitral regurgitation also had significant increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 18.7% +/- 5.8 mm Hg to 24.3% +/- 8.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.05).
 There were no changes in late or early wave amplitude, late to early ratio, or other Doppler measurements in any of the other groups.
 We conclude that mitral regurgitation caused by pacing-induced myocardial ischemia normalizes Doppler indices of mitral inflow, which in turn, may mask persistent or worsened left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

815,"Experiential phenomena of temporal lobe epilepsy. Facts and hypotheses.
 Experiential phenomena that occur in temporal lobe seizures and can be reproduced by electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures typically encompass perceptual, mnemonic and affective features, either in combination or in isolation, which commonly relate to the patient's individual past experience.
 These phenomena raise interesting questions concerning brain mechanisms involved in human psychophysiology.
 The anatomical substrates for the evocation of these phenomena are widely distributed within the temporal lobe and include temporal isocortex and limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus).
 Arguments are presented which indicate that experiential phenomena are positive expressions of temporal lobe and limbic function and do not result from its ictal paralysis.
 Recent concepts of parallel distributed processing (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986) and the importance of parallel distributed cortical networks for higher cognitive functions (Goldman-Rakic, 1988a, b) provide a theoretical framework on which a hypothesis explaining experiential phenomena can be based.
 In conformity with these concepts the hypothesis assumes that temporal lobe epileptic discharge or electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures can induce the elaboration of patterns of excitation and inhibition in widely distributed neuronal networks, some of which are capable of forming a specific matrix representing the substrate of a given experience.
 Neuronal networks engaged in parallel distributed processing (1) have the capacity to recreate the totality of a given experience when only a fragment of the network is activated, and (2) they tolerate a great deal of degradation by random inactivation of its components or by interference through random noise without serious loss of information content.
 These features are compatible with the assumption that localized epileptic neuronal discharge or electrical stimulation involving some temporal lobe structures could create a matrix representing features of individual experience of the kind activated in the course of temporal lobe seizures.
 Such an experience could, up to a certain limit, resist the degrading influence of mounting noise which inevitably must attend seizure discharge.

 Intraoperative endoscopy (IOE) is accepted as the ultimate diagnostic procedure for completely evaluating the small bowel in patients with obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.
 Small bowel enteroscopy (SBE) has been reported useful in the nonsurgical evaluation of the small intestine in these patients, but findings may be limited because of incomplete small bowel intubation and a lack of tip deflection.
 Twenty-three patients underwent 25 SBE exams and subsequently had 25 IOE exams during surgical exploration for continued bleeding.
 Patients' bleeding histories averaged 2 yr, with an average transfusion requirement of 27 units.
 Findings on IOE were the same as with SBE in 17/22 (77%) of examinations.
 We conclude that SBE and IOE are comparable in depth of insertion and ability to detect small vascular ectasias.
 Both procedures missed pathology due to limited visibility and the evanescent nature of ectasias.
 Long-term success in abolishing bleeding with these combined techniques can be expected in 55% of these patients.
 SBE should precede surgery, since the finding of diffuse ectasias precludes any benefit from operative intervention.

 One of two patients with uncertain clinical status of the nodes preoperatively had positive deep nodes.
 In prophylactic node dissection, frozen section of the inguinal group of the nodes does not provide a reliable method, because of sampling errors, in determining microscopic involvement of the nodes and in deciding whether a superficial or radical groin dissection is to be done.

 The optimal model was selected for each group of classifications with equal stage number, thus giving the greatest prognostic information on 5-year survival according to the Akaike criterion.
 The results showed that (1) 13% of the total classifications, including 85% of the 3-stage classifications, were better than the Dukes system in predicting our patients' outcomes; (2) the T-level was a stage-determinant even more important than the N-level; and (3) major changes in prognosis occurred at more advanced stages than the classical ""turning points"".

 The findings obtained from the aspirated cells with the use of the fluorescent cytochemical technique were compared with results obtained from the cell population of the same tumor after removal with the use of both the fluorescent cytochemical technique and the biochemical dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay.
 For the needle aspirates, there was 89% concordance for estrogen receptor and 86% concordance for progesterone receptor between biochemical and cytochemical results.
 A high degree of correlation was also demonstrated between fine-needle aspirates and imprint preparations with the use of the cytochemical technique.

 To determine the frequency, pattern, and time course of tumor recurrence in the breast, the outcome of 38 women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy between 1976 and 1985 was studied.
 Surgery typically consisted of local excision without evaluation of the microscopic margins of resection.
 The median radiation dose to the tumor site was 6400 cGy.
 With a median follow-up time of 81 months, eight patients (21%) have experienced a recurrence in the breast.
 The time course to recurrence was protracted in some cases, with failures occurring at 17, 27, 43, 63, 71, 83, 92, and 104 months.
 The 5-year and 8-year actuarial rates of tumor recurrence in the breast were 8% and 27%, respectively.
 Seven patients had a recurrence at or near the primary tumor site, four with invasive carcinoma, and one had an invasive recurrence at a site elsewhere in the breast.
 No clinical or pathologic factor was significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrence, but the number of patients in the study population was small.
 The authors reached the following conclusions for patients with DCIS treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy without careful mammographic and pathologic evaluation: (1) recurrence in the breast may be seen in at least one fifth of the patients; (2) recurrence typically occurs at or near the primary site; and (3) recurrence can occur long after treatment.
 Careful mammographic and pathologic assessment may be useful in reducing the local recurrence rate and should be considered essential if patients are considered for conservative surgery and radiation therapy.

 Complaints of poor memory by patients may be an early symptom of a pathologic process like Alzheimer's disease.
 It is therefore important to determine if patients' complaints of memory impairments are an accurate reflection of real memory disturbance.
 The relationship between memory complaints (metamemory) and objective memory performance, mood, age, verbal intelligence, and sex was examined in a group of 199 healthy, community dwelling adults (39 to 89 years old).
 Memory complaints demonstrated a stronger association with depressed mood than with performance on memory tests.
 Increasing reports of depressive symptoms were associated with more overall memory complaints.
 Verbal intelligence, age, and sex also contributed to memory complaints.
 Patients with higher verbal intelligence reported fewer complaints and placed less emphasis on forgetting.
 Older individuals reported greater frequency of forgetting and greater frequency of using memory techniques.
 Specific types of memory complaints, seriousness of forgetting, and types of memory aids employed are also described.
 These results showed that self-rating of memory disturbance by older adults may be related more to depressed mood than to poor performance on memory tests.

 Because life-style patterns affect many cancer risks, research on health-risk behavior and behavior change is critical to cancer prevention.

 Such research must be theoretically driven and should aim to develop broad principles applicable to diverse health behaviors.
 Studies that include relevant process data on various stages of behavior change are considered more desirable than simple outcome studies.
 Epidemiologic investigations should be expanded to include measures of relevant behaviors, so that their impact on clinical outcomes might be established.
 More research is needed on lay perception of health risks and on individual and health-system barriers to effective cancer prevention and detection.
 Studies that address the needs of minority and underprivileged populations are crucial.

829,"Lacunar transient ischaemic attacks: a clinically useful concept?
 Lacunar ischaemic stroke syndromes are clinically, pathophysiologically, and prognostically distinguishable from cortical ischaemic stroke syndromes.
 Could cerebrovascular transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) share similar heterogeneity? 130 patients with TIAs were prospectively studied, 71 of whom underwent carotid angiography.
 Symptoms were associated with a 50% or greater stenosis of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery in 36 (67%) of 54 patients with presumed cortical TIAs, but in only 1 (6%) of 17 patients with presumed lacunar TIAs (p less than 0.0001).
 These findings support the view that cortical TIAs are associated with ipsilateral extracranial internal carotid artery atheromatous disease, whereas patients with lacunar TIAs may have absent or insignificant large-vessel disease, and probable intracranial small-vessel disease.
 Accurate distinction between lacunar and cortical events may have implications for investigation and treatment of patients with TIAs.

 Three patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics state IIIC ovarian adenocarcinoma underwent CO2 laser vaporization of large-volume (5-6 cm) and miliary right hemidiaphragmatic metastases at the conclusion of standard debulking surgery to effect optimal cytoreduction.
 Destruction of diaphragmatic metastases was accomplished rapidly with no added morbidity or blood loss.
 The hand-held CO2 laser is a useful modality for removal of isolated large- and small-volume diaphragmatic disease, particularly if only the peritoneum is involved, and avoids the morbidity that may accompany entry into the pleural space.

832,"The impact of physician compliance on screening mammography for older women.
 Screening mammography is underutilized, even for women older than 50 years for whom there is a general consensus that regular annual screening is appropriate and necessary.
 To evaluate reasons for this underutilization, we studied a random sample of 517 women in Los Angeles, Calif who were older than 50 years.
 All women were found to be underscreened, especially women older than 65 years.
 For example, approximately 35% of women 50 to 64 years old and 47% of women aged 65 years and older never had had even one mammogram.
 Analyses revealed that the most important factor that predicted whether a women ever had had a mammogram was whether her physician had talked to her about mammography.
 Women were between four and 12 times more likely, depending on their age group, to have had a mammogram at some time if their physicians discussed it with them.
 The discussions did not need to be lengthy or complex.
 These results indicate that physicians need to know that discussing screening mammography with their patients has a major impact on breast cancer screening behaviors.

 Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is the treatment of choice in aborting the acute attack of migraine.
 Although its efficacy has been known for 40 years, its mechanism of action is still disputed.
 Data regarding the site of action of dihydroergotamine may provide an insight into its mechanism of action and thus identify a locus of potentially abnormal pathophysiology in migraine.
 By using in vitro and ex vivo autoradiographic techniques, the localization of specific binding sites for 3H-dihydroergotamine in the cat brain has been examined.
 Binding was seen in the dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord, in the medulla, associated with the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, area postrema, and descending spinal trigeminal nucleus, and in the mesencephalon and the cerebral cortex.
 The highest density of binding sites was found in the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei of the midbrain.
 Furthermore, these same brain regions were also labeled after intravenous administration of 3H-dihydroergotamine.
 It is important that the brain areas specifically labeled are key nuclei involved in cranial pain transmission, suggesting that dihydroergotamine may act at these central sites in migraine.

835,"Effect of intracoronary serotonin on coronary vessels in patients with stable angina and patients with variant angina 
 BACKGROUND.
 Serotonin, a major product of platelet activation, has potent vasoactive effects in animal models, but its role in human coronary artery disease remains largely speculative.
 METHODS.
 Using quantitative coronary angiography, we compared the effects of the intracoronary infusion of graded concentrations of serotonin (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol per liter) on coronary vessels in two groups of patients with different clinical presentations of coronary disease (nine with stable angina and five with variant angina), with the effects in a control group of eight subjects with normal vessels on angiography.
 RESULTS.
 Normal coronary vessels had a biphasic response to intracoronary serotonin: dilation at concentrations up to 10(-5) mol per liter, but constriction at 10(-4) mol per liter.
 Vessels in patients with stable angina constricted at all concentrations, with mean (+/- SEM) maximal decreases in diameter of 23.9 +/- 3.6, 33.1 +/- 3.9, and 41.7 +/- 3.1 percent from base line in proximal, middle, and distal segments at a serotonin concentration of 10(-4) mol per liter.
 Smooth segments constricted more than irregular segments (42.0 +/- 4.6 vs.
 21.1 +/- 1.6 percent).
 Four patients with stable angina had a marked reduction in collateral filling.
 All the patients with stable angina had angina during the intracoronary infusion of serotonin, and electrocardiographic changes were noted in six.
 All the patients with variant angina had angina, electrocardiographic changes, and localized occlusive epicardial coronary-artery spasm at concentrations of 10(-6) (n = 2) or 10(-5) (n = 3) mol per liter.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Patients with stable coronary disease do not have the normal vasodilator response to intracoronary serotonin, but rather have progressive constriction, which is particularly intense in small distal and collateral vessels.
 Patients with variant angina have occlusive coronary-artery spasm at a dose that dilates normal vessels and causes only slight constriction in vessels from patients with stable angina.
 These findings suggest that serotonin, released after the intracoronary activation of platelets, may contribute to or cause myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease.

836,"Pancreatic tumor pathogenesis reflects the causative genetic lesion.
 Transgenic mice in which c-myc expression is targeted to pancreatic acinar cells develop mixed acinar/ductal pancreatic adenocarcinomas between 2 and 7 months of age.
 This contrasts with the effect on pancreas of the simian virus 40 tumor antigen or activated ras, which in adult mice causes lesions composed exclusively of acinar-like cells.
 Furthermore, during an early stage of myc-induced pathology, transformed acinar-derived cells appear within islets, suggesting that islet hormones may influence the progression of these exocrine pancreatic tumors.
 These findings demonstrate that the initial oncogenic alteration can influence the pattern of subsequent tumor pathogenesis and, given that human exocrine pancreatic tumors are predominantly ductal adenocarcinomas, support the suggestion that transformed acinar cells may contribute to the genesis of this serious disease in man.

 One hundred patients, aged twenty to ninety-two years, underwent 111 procedures for removal of bladder calculi.
 Most patients (88) had some type of bladder outlet obstruction.
 Two types of stones were identified: those that had apparently formed in the upper tract and been trapped in the bladder (17 cases) and those that appeared to have formed in the bladder in the presence of various types of outlet obstruction.
 Stone analysis revealed uric acid stones in 50 percent, calcium oxalate stones in 19 percent, and stones of mixed composition in 31 percent.
 Five patients had metabolic abnormalities predisposing to stone formation; in 2 cases, these abnormalities were discovered during the evaluation for stone disease.
 Treatment depended on stone characteristics, associated pathology, and the general health of the patient.

838,"Down-regulation of a calmodulin-related gene during transformation of human mammary epithelial cells.
 A human cDNA library obtained from cultured normal mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) was searched by subtractive hybridization for genes whose decrease in expression might be relevant to epithelial transformation.
 One clone identified by this procedure corresponded to a 1.4-kilobase mRNA, designated NB-1, whose expression was decreased greater than 50-fold in HMECs tumorigenically transformed in vitro after exposure to benzo[a]pyrene and Kirsten sarcoma virus.
 Sequence analysis of NB-1 cDNA revealed an open reading frame with a high degree of homology to calmodulin.
 NB-1 expression could be demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction amplification in normal breast, prostate, cervix, and epidermal tissues.
 The presence of NB-1 transcripts was variable in primary breast carcinoma tissues and undetectable in tumor-derived cell lines of breast, prostate, or other origins.
 NB-1 mRNA expression could be down-regulated in cultured HMECs by exposure to reconstituted extracellular matrix material, while exposure to transforming growth factor type beta increased its relative abundance.
 The protein encoded by NB-1 may have Ca2+ binding properties and perform functions similar to those of authentic calmodulin.
 Its possible roles in differentiation and/or suppression of tumorigenicity in epithelial tissues remain to be examined.

 One hundred seventy-four women with invasive cervical carcinoma were interviewed about their cervical smear histories to assess the accuracy of self-reporting and to relate the smear history with patient and tumor characteristics.
 Patients reported significantly more frequent, more recent, and more normal smears than were documented in medical records.
 The interval between onset of cancer symptoms and previous smear correlated directly with advanced stage.
 Sixteen women with normal smears within 36 months had significantly more advanced cancers than did 25 women with recent abnormal smears.
 Women with recent normal and abnormal smears had similar sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics.
 Because of inaccuracies in patients' self-reported smear histories and cancers developing in women with recent normal smears, we conclude that a specific screening interval should not be relied upon.

 The results confirm previous research pointing out that married people tend to receive assistance from their spouse.
 Among nonmarrieds, children are named most frequently as the primary caregiver.
 After children, however, those who live alone tend to receive assistance from friends, and those who live with nonspousal others receive assistance from siblings.

 Cultured Schwann cells derived from adult mouse dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves were transfected with a plasmid containing SV-40 large T antigen gene, and 25 colonies of stable transformants were obtained, one of which was expanded and recloned.
 This transfected cell line, designated MS1, expressed SV-40 large T antigen and showed continuous cell growth with a doubling time of 27 hours.
 The MS1 cells had distinct Schwann cell phenotypes such as S-100 protein, laminin, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase and P0 protein, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy.
 When MS1 cells were exposed to dibutyryl cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (dbc AMP), they extended long bipolar processes two- to ten-fold longer than those of untreated MS1 cells and frequently formed whorl-like alignments similar to palisade formations or organoid patterns observed in human Schwannomas and neurofibromas.

 Two hundred consecutive patients with femoral neck fractures (FNF) and 200 controls matched by age, sex, nursing home residency and number of admissions within the last 2 years, were interviewed about recent drug use.
 The matching criteria were chosen to achieve case and control groups that were comparable with regard to overall physical disability.
 Thus a preliminary study had shown FNF to be strongly associated with nursing home residency and to be correlated with the number of recent hospital admissions.
 FNF was found to be negatively associated with use of coronary drugs (OR = 0.27; 95% CI = 0.11-0.70) and positively associated with drug use in general (OR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.04-3.05).
 The OR for the various classes of psychotropic drugs was consistently greater than 1., although this was not statistically significant.
 An inherent problem in interpreting such findings is that underlying disease may predispose the subject to both FNF and drug use, thus creating a non-causal relationship.

 Cesarean delivery has become the most frequently performed major operation in the United States.
 Widespread use of vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery could potentially eliminate up to one-third of cesareans.
 However, many physicians have been reluctant to adopt this policy without large studies conclusively demonstrating its safety.
 This study evaluated the maternal and perinatal outcomes of over 5000 cases of labor after previous cesarean delivery.
 This multicenter study began in 1984 and initially included nine California hospitals.
 During the first 2 years, there were 1776 trials of labor resulting in 1314 vaginal births.
 In January 1986 two additional hospitals joined the collaborative project.
 Over the next 3 years, there were 3957 trials of labor resulting in 2977 vaginal births at the 11 participating hospitals.
 During the entire study period, 5733 patients opted for a trial of labor and 4291 (75%) delivered vaginally.
 There were no maternal deaths in the trial-of-labor group, and perinatal mortality was not significantly different from that of the general obstetric population.
 These results support the findings of numerous smaller studies that have concluded that the policy of routine repeat cesarean delivery should be abandoned.

 In patients with extensive full-thickness burns, wound coverage may be accelerated if skin can be expanded to produce a skin replacement that reproducibly supplies blood to the wound and has good structural qualities.
 In addition, development of skin replacements may benefit patients who require reconstruction or replacement of large areas of abnormal skin.
 We have developed a composite skin replacement composed of cultured human keratinocytes (HK) and fibroblasts.
 Cultured human fibroblasts are seeded into the interstices, and cultured HKs are applied to the surface of a matrix composed of type I collagen crosslinked with a glycosaminoglycan, which has a defined physical structure.
 After HKs reach confluence on the matrix surface, the composite grafts are placed on full-thickness wounds on the dorsum of athymic mice.
 Graft acceptance, confirmed by positive staining with antibodies specific for human HLA-ABC antigens on HKs, is approximately 90%.
 A defined skin structure is present histologically by day 10 after grafting, with a differentiated epithelium and a subepidermal layer densely populated by fibroblasts and capillaries without evidence of inflammation.
 Fluorescent light microscopy to identify laminin and type IV collagen and electron microscopy confirm the presence of basement membrane components by 10 days after grafting.
 Attachment of the graft to the wound is similar with and without the addition of human basic fibroblast growth factor, a potent angiogenic agent, to the skin replacement before graft placement on wounds.

 The membrane interaction and hydrophobicity of the normal (PrPC) and infectious isoform (PrPSc/CJD) of scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease amyloid precursor proteins was studied.
 The normal isoform of hamster and human scrapie amyloid precursor protein was found on the microsomal/synaptosomal membranes anchored solely by the C-terminal glycolipid.
 Glycolipid cleavage resulted in dissociation from the membranes and change of behavior from a highly hydrophobic to a hydrophilic protein, susceptible to proteases.
 In contrast, the PrPSc/CJD isoform was resistant to release by glycolipid-cleaving enzymes.
 A part of PrPSc/CJD was released from the membranes after prolonged trypsin treatment, yielding a further protease-resistant product of 27-30 kDa.
 The results demonstrate the proteolytic resistance of the membrane-bound PrPSc/CJD isoform and also indicate the presence of a different, apparently disease-induced mechanism of membrane interaction in the scrapie- and CJD-infected microsomal and synaptosomal membranes.

 In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), compared with age-matched and young healthy control subjects, visual deficits in the following functions were observed: color, stereoacuity, contrast sensitivity, and backward masking (homogeneous and pattern).
 Critical flicker fusion thresholds were normal, relative to age-matched healthy subjects.
 For color, the majority of the errors were tritanomalous (blue axis).
 Color and stereoacuity deficits were unrelated to severity of dementia, in accordance with models of vision that describe these functions as modular rather than diffuse for cortical localization.
 Although contrast sensitivity was depressed throughout the frequency range in AD, more patients were impaired at low than at high spatial frequencies, contrasting with the observed normal aging pattern of high-frequency loss.
 Healthy elderly subjects showed depressed critical flicker fusion thresholds and reduced contrast sensitivity at high frequencies, relative to the young group; differences between these groups were not found for the other vision tests.
 A subset of the AD group received detailed neuro-ophthalmological examination, and no abnormalities were found.
 This finding, taken together with normal thresholds for critical flicker fusion, suggests that the widespread visual dysfunction reported here is more likely to be related to known pathological changes in primary visual and association cortex in AD than to changes in the retina or optic nerve.

 In the management of the patient with intra-abdominal recurrence of colorectal carcinoma, surgery remains the primary mode of therapy when cure or significant palliation is anticipated.
 Appreciation of the importance of close follow-up after primary resection coupled with improved diagnostic modalities has allowed the surgeon not only to detect earlier recurrence but also to select the patients most likely to benefit from resection of recurrent disease.
 Improved surgical techniques with resultant decreases in the rates of morbidity and mortality have allowed safe hepatic resection of metastatic disease.
 In selected patients, this procedure produces 5-year survival rates approaching 50%.
 Although a clear consensus has not been reached, most studies agree that positive prognostic indicators include absence of extrahepatic disease, a small number of intrahepatic lesions, a low CEA level, and a better Dukes stage of the primary.
 Likewise, in the patient with recurrent disease locally, surgery provides the only means of cure and also plays a significant role in palliation.
 Aggressive resection with generous surgical margins in patients with contained disease may yield 5-year survival rates approaching 35%.
 In patients with unresectable disease and even in those with carcinomatosis, palliation can be obtained by surgical therapy.

 In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at baseline study, regional myocardial blood flow was 1.14 +/- 0.43 ml/min per g in the hypertrophied (20 +/- 3 mm) interventricular septum and 0.90 +/- 0.35 ml/min per g (p less than 0.05 versus septal flow) in the nonhypertrophied (10 +/- 2 mm) left ventricular free wall.
 These were not statistically different from the corresponding values in control subjects (1.04 +/- 0.25 and 0.91 +/- 0.21 ml/min per g, respectively, p = NS).

 This paper reviews reports of phantom limb sensations which resemble somatosensory events experienced in the limb before amputation.
 It also presents descriptions of this phenomenon in 68 amputees who took part in a series of clinical studies.
 These somatosensory memories are predominantly replicas of distressing pre-amputation lesions and pains which were experienced at or near the time of amputation, and are described as having the same qualities of sensation as the pre-amputation pain.
 The patients who experience these pains emphasize that they are suffering real pain which they can describe in vivid detail, and insist that the experience is not merely a cognitive recollection of an earlier pain.
 Reports of somatosensory memories are less common when there has been a discontinuity, or a pain-free interval, between the experience of pain and amputation.
 Among the somatosensory memories reported are cutaneous lesions, deep tissue injuries, bone and joint pain and painful pre-amputation postures.
 The experience of somatosensory memories does not appear to be related to the duration of pre-amputation pain, time since amputation, age, gender, prosthetic use, level of amputation, number of limbs amputated, or whether the amputation followed an accident or illness.
 The results suggest that somatosensory inputs of sufficient intensity and duration can produce lasting changes in central neural structures which combine with cognitive-evaluative memories of the pre-amputation pain to give rise to the unified experience of a past pain referred to the phantom limb.
 Implications for pre- and post-operative pain control are discussed.

 A study on the value of a commercially available desk-top digital magnifier-contrast enhancer (DETECT System) was made in a series of 550 patients presenting with an acute wrist injury.
 Four radiologists, of varying experience, independently reviewed the radiographs on a conventional lightbox and later with the digitizer.
 In the scaphoid series (350 cases), the performance of the two more experienced radiologists was marginally better with the digitizer, whereas the less experienced radiologists performed slightly worse.
 Overall the digitizer improved the confidence of the radiologists in diagnosing correctly the presence of a scaphoid fracture but, for the less experienced radiologists, this was at the expense of identifying normality.
 In the wrist series (200 cases), the use of the digitizer resulted in a minor increase in the true positive and decrease in the false negative observations, but this was offset by a concomitant minor increase in the false positive and decrease in the true negative categories.
 Evaluation of the soft-tissue planes around the wrist joint showed a limited value in the identification of a scaphoid fracture with an overall positive predictive value of 0.26.
 Correlation of soft-tissue changes and the presence or absence of a scaphoid fracture was slightly worse with the digitizer.

 Although behavioral performance (button-press accuracy, reaction time, and running counts) was comparable across all groups (although accuracy was worse for those in the left temporal group), patients showed tremendous variability in both the amplitude and latency of the P300 response.
 Particularly notable was the observation that more slow wave activity was present among the patients than among the control subjects, and those scheduled for a left temporal resection evinced more amplitude reduction than those scheduled for a right temporal resection.
 In addition, a number of patients appeared not to show a P300 response at all.
 These results are discussed in the context of the utility of using noninvasive event-related potential measures to examine both memory impairment and the integrity of the neural structures that mediate memory functioning in certain patient populations.

861,"Progress in psychosocial and behavioral cancer research. The need for enabling strategies.
 A major component of the Second Workshop on Methodology in Behavioral and Psychosocial Cancer Research was a discussion of enabling strategies, that is, strategies by which future goals and needs in the area of psychosocial and behavioral oncology might be accomplished.
 This report describes and comments on the discussion that took place at a special plenary session at which representatives from four funding agencies, the American Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Mental Health, and National Science Foundation, presented their views and their agencies' programs for promoting research in psychosocial and behavioral oncology.
 It is concluded that much progress has been made in the field and that strategies are in place for ensuring continued progress.
 However, suggestions are also made for new strategies that might accelerate and broaden that progress.

 Fifteen men, mean (means) age 44 years, were investigated.
 Their means body mass index was 21.9 kg/m2, and all of them had a respiratory disturbance index below 5 and had good nocturnal oxygen saturation.
 The subjects were monitored several nights both with and without the following devices: a tight-fitting facial mask, a pneumotachometer, and an esophageal balloon.
 They were also monitored with and without nasal continuous positive airway pressure.
 The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was administered after three of the experimental nights (after the baseline nights and after the second nasal CPAP night).
 Determination of short EEG arousals during nocturnal sleep, which lasted 2 to 10 s, was performed.
 The relationship between short EEG arousals, the esophageal pressure nadir, and airflow decrease was investigated.
 We also determined the relationship between clinical reporting of decrease in daytime alertness and MSLT results, and the relationship between MSLT results and the frequency of EEG arousals.
 The monitoring indicated that heavy snorers may present significant increase in Pes nadir with abrupt decrease in flow leading to EEG arousals.
 The frequency at which EEG arousals occur has an impact on MSLT scores.
 Nasal CPAP improves MSLT scores and eliminates these respiration-related EEG arousals.
 Some heavy snorers without obstructive sleep apnea syndrome may be at risk of having a decrease in daytime alertness.

863,"Effects of bucindolol on neurohormonal activation in congestive heart failure.
 To examine the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on neurohormonal activation in patients with congestive heart failure, 15 men had assessments of hemodynamics and supine peripheral renin and norepinephrine levels before and after 3 months of oral therapy with bucindolol, a nonselective beta antagonist.
 At baseline, plasma renin activity did not correlate with any hemodynamic parameter.
 However, norepinephrine levels had a weak correlation with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01), stroke volume index (r = 0.61, p less than 0.02) and pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.54, p less than 0.05).
 Plasma renin decreased with bucindolol therapy, from 11.6 +/- 13.4 to 4.3 +/- 4.1 ng/ml/hour (mean +/- standard deviation; p less than 0.05), whereas plasma norepinephrine was unchanged, from 403 +/- 231 to 408 +/- 217 pg/ml.
 A wide diversity of the norepinephrine response to bucindolol was observed with reduction of levels in some patients and elevation in others.
 Although plasma norepinephrine did not decrease, heart rate tended to decrease (from 82 +/- 20 vs 73 +/- 11 min-1, p = 0.059) with beta-adrenergic blockade, suggesting neurohormonal antagonism at the receptor level.
 No changes in I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake occurred after bucindolol therapy, suggesting unchanged adrenergic uptake of norepinephrine with beta-blocker therapy.
 Despite reductions in plasma renin activity and the presence of beta blockade, the response of renin or norepinephrine levels to long-term bucindolol therapy did not predict which patients had improved in hemodynamic status (chi-square = 0.37 for renin, 0.82 for norepinephrine).

864,"Are universal precautions effective in reducing the number of occupational exposures among health care workers? A prospective study of physicians on a medical service 
 Using a daily questionnaire, we prospectively studied 277 physicians from two hospital medical services for incidents of exposure to blood and body fluids and barrier use before and after the implementation of universal precautions.
 We found that implementation significantly increased the frequency of barrier use during exposure incidents from 54% before implementation to 73% after implementation of universal precautions.
 Implementation led to a decrease in the number of exposure incidents that resulted in direct contact with blood and body fluids (actual exposures), from 5.07 to 2.66 exposures per physician per patient care month, and to an increase in averted exposures in which direct contact was prevented by the use of barrier devices, from 3.41 exposures per patient care month before implementation to 5.90 exposures per patient care month after implementation.
 Implementation affected neither the types of body fluid or procedures involved nor the overall rate of exposure incidents (8.5 per patient care month) but, through an increase in barrier use, it did prevent direct contact with blood and body fluids and thus converted what would have been an actual exposure into an averted one.
 We conclude that universal precautions were effective in reducing the risk of occupational exposures among physicians on a medical service.

 In a review of pooled data from five double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of nimodipine in acute ischemic stroke, we compared the effect of 120 mg nimodipine given orally with that of placebo.
 In the five studies, 871 patients were followed, and 781 adhered to entry and inclusion criteria.
 End points were mortality and outcome at the end of the treatment period (21 or 28 days).
 Outcome was assessed with Mathew's scale and the physician's clinical judgement.
 The treatment and control groups were well matched with respect to demographic data, risk factors, and baseline Mathew scores.
 In the treatment group, 34 patients (7.9%) died during the treatment period, whereas 54 (12.3%) in the control group died, corresponding with a mortality reduction of 36%.
 Significantly less neurologic impairment at the end of the treatment period was documented under nimodipine treatment, and this impairment improved more in patients with moderate-to-severe stroke (baseline Mathew score less than 66) if administration of nimodipine occurred within 12 hours after stroke onset or if the patient was more than 65 years old.
 The overall incidence of adverse reactions was relatively modest, and these were of minor severity; only a few appeared to have more than a remote relation to the study medication.

867,"Fluosol: an oxygen-delivery fluid for use in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
 Fluosol (20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion) is an oxygen-carrying emulsion used to deliver oxygen to ischemic myocardium during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).
 Fluosol is composed of two perfluorochemicals, perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine.
 It has a high capacity for oxygen solubility, a low viscosity, and a small particle size.
 Following administration, the perfluorochemicals in fluosol are not metabolized.
 Rather, most are expired as gaseous particles through the lungs; the remainder are taken up by the organs of the reticuloendothelial system and later expired.
 When administered during balloon inflation in PTCA, fluosol preserves ventricular wall motion and global left ventricular ejection fraction.
 In addition, it minimizes ST segment changes and preserves cardiac output.
 Fluosol may be especially useful in patients who have poor contractile reserve, multivessel disease, or serious underlying illness.
 Other uses under investigation include limitation of myocardial infarct size and chemosensitization or radiosensitization of malignant tumors.
 Adverse effects secondary to the use of fluosol include ventricular arrhythmias, pruritus, bradycardia, chest pain, dyspnea, and increased respiratory rate.
 Fluosol must be thawed, admixed, warmed to body temperature, and oxygenated prior to intracoronary administration.
 The usual administration rate is 60 mL/min during each balloon inflation.

 Attempted suicide by the elderly is a major psychiatric problem.
 Ninety-five patients between 60 and 90 years of age were evaluated by a psychiatric consultation service after a suicide attempt.
 Characteristics of this group included (1) a high degree of premeditation, (2) a tendency toward firearm use and wounds to the head, (3) male sex, (4) coexisting medical problems, (5) serious intent that increased by decade, (6) solitary living arrangements, (7) presence or history of a major psychiatric illness, and (8) ill health reported as a precipitant to suicidality.
 Major depression was the most common psychiatric diagnosis, with congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the most frequently noted physical ailments.
 This elderly population of attempters resembled older persons who actually completed suicide and differed significantly from 1630 persons aged 16 to 59 years who attempted suicide.
 Heightened investigation of depressive features, treatment of alcohol abuse, early referral for psychiatric care, limited access to firearms, and strategies aimed at decreasing social isolation are recommended to decrease the likelihood of completed suicide in the elderly.

 The use of microvascular endothelial cells derived from omental tissue has been advocated to seed vascular grafts with autologous endothelial cells in high density.
 The purpose of our study was to evaluate the precise origin of these cells.
 Therefore we have compared cellular characteristics of these cells with those of endothelial cells isolated by collagenase treatment of human umbilical veins.
 The omental cells were isolated from from omental tissue from four different patients by incubation in a collagenase-dispase solution.
 Part of the material was processed by Percoll density gradient centrifugation in an attempt to purify the isolates.
 Cellular characteristics of both types of cells were determined by studying the morphologic features of the cells and by determining the presence of von Willebrand factor, antigens EN-4 and PAL-E specific for endothelial cells, cytokeratins 8 and 18, vimentin and desmin, and uptake of diI-acetylated low-density lipoprotein.
 Epitheloid cells from omental tissue, isolated after collagenase treatment and either purified or nonpurified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, differed from human umbilical vein endothelial cells with respect to the presence of surface microvilli, the expression of von Willebrand factor, EN-4 and PAL-E, and the presence of cytokeratins 8 and 18 and desmin.
 von Willebrand factor (in a granular staining pattern) and the presence of EN-4 and PAL-E were only detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
 Vimentin was present in both cell types, whereas cytokeratins 8 and 18 and desmin were only present in cells derived from omentum.
 From these data we conclude that the so called microvascular endothelial cells from omentum are not endothelial but mesothelial in nature.

 Since the cloning of the cDNA for X-linked ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) in 1984, diagnostic accuracy of OTC deficiency for prenatal and carrier detection has been greatly improved by the use of linkage analysis.
 However, the use of RFLP-based diagnosis is limited in this and in other new mutation diseases.
 Here we report both the use of direct mutation detection by new PCR-based techniques and our experience with linkage-based diagnosis in 18 families.
 We have previously reported the use of chemical mismatch cleavage to detect mutations first in amplified mRNA and then in genomic DNA of patients.
 This technique has now been utilized for prenatal diagnosis.
 Primers for specific amplification of OTC exons 1, 3, 5, 9, and 10 have been developed and been employed to map deletions of the OTC gene in two families.
 These primers also have been used to detect alterations in the TaqI sites found in exons 1, 3, 5, and 9.
 Four novel mutations of the OTC gene leading to abolition of a TaqI site in the OTC cDNA were discovered.
 One of these mutations is in exon 1; two lie in exon 3; and one is in exon 9.
 In addition, we have used the PCR products as probes to identify the exon-specific bands seen on Southern blots and to map the polymorphic BamHI and MspI sites, which are commonly used for linkage analysis.
 This information will facilitate the interpretation of altered band patterns seen in deletion cases and in cases of point mutations affecting restriction sites.
 Utilization of the appropriate combination of these molecular techniques permitted accurate diagnostic evaluations in 17 of 18 families.

875,"Regression of coronary artery disease as a result of intensive lipid-lowering therapy in men with high levels of apolipoprotein B 
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS.
 The effect of intensive lipid-lowering therapy on coronary atherosclerosis among men at high risk for cardiovascular events was assessed by quantitative arteriography.
 Of 146 men no more than 62 years of age who had apolipoprotein B levels greater than or equal to 125 mg per deciliter, documented coronary artery disease, and a family history of vascular disease, 120 completed the 2 1/2-year double-blind study, which included arteriography at base line and after treatment.
 Patients were given dietary counseling and were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: lovastatin (20 mg twice a day) and colestipol (10 g three times a day); niacin (1 g four times a day) and colestipol (10 g three times a day); or conventional therapy with placebo (or colestipol if the low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level was elevated).
 RESULTS.
 The levels of LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol changed only slightly in the conventional-therapy group (mean changes, -7 and +5 percent, respectively), but more substantially among patients treated with lovastatin and colestipol (-46 and +15 percent) or niacin and colestipol (-32 and +43 percent).
 In the conventional-therapy group, 46 percent of the patients had definite lesion progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11 percent.
 By comparison, progression (as the only change) was less frequent among patients who received lovastatin and colestipol (21 percent) and those who received niacin and colestipol (25 percent), and regression was more frequent (lovastatin and colestipol, 32 percent; niacin and colestipol, 39 percent; P less than 0.005).
 Multivariate analysis indicated that a reduction in the level of apolipoprotein B (or LDL cholesterol) and in systolic blood pressure, and an increase in HDL cholesterol correlated independently with regression of coronary lesions.
 Clinical events (death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization for worsening symptoms) occurred in 10 of 52 patients assigned to conventional therapy, as compared with 3 of 46 assigned to receive lovastatin and colestipol and 2 of 48 assigned to receive niacin and colestipol (relative risk of an event during intensive treatment, 0.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.77).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 In men with coronary artery disease who were at high risk for cardiovascular events, intensive lipid-lowering therapy reduced the frequency of progression of coronary lesions, increased the frequency of regression, and reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events.

 In a retrospective analysis 139 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were followed up for 8.9 years (range 1 to 28 years).
 Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 consisted of 60 patients with medical therapy and Group 2 of 79 patients with surgical therapy (septal myectomy).
 Groups 1 and 2 were subdivided according to the medical treatment.
 Group 1a received propranolol, 160 mg/day (n = 20); Group 1b verapamil, 360 mg/day (n = 18); and Group 1c, no therapy (n = 22).
 Group 2a received verapamil, 120 to 360 mg/day, after septal myectomy (n = 17) and Group 2b had no medical therapy after surgery (n = 62).
 In Group 1, 19 patients died (annual mortality rate 3.6%) and in Group 2, 17 patients died (mortality rate 2.4%, p = NS).
 Of the patients who died, approximately one half to two thirds in both Groups 1 and 2 died suddenly and the other one half to one third died because of congestive heart failure.
 The 10 year cumulative survival rate was 67% in Group 1, significantly smaller than that in Group 2 (84%, p less than 0.05).

 Innovative advances in both morphologic and functional imaging have led to a dramatic improvement in our ability to diagnose and monitor human cancer.
 Frequently, anatomic detail can be demonstrated in ways that exceed views at surgery, and functional biochemical imaging is being used to show the metabolic activity and receptor status of normal and pathologic states.
 In vivo functional and biochemical studies differentiate normal from neoplastic or nonviable tissue, and make it possible to measure progression or regression of the disease.
 Because physiologic changes often precede morphologic findings in many disease processes, the use of in vivo biochemical probes can demonstrate disease before anatomic abnormalities become evident.
 Gross changes in anatomy are no longer adequate endpoints for therapy protocols.
 Today, using physiologic imaging, we can evaluate the response to treatment within hours of administration of therapy.

 The effects of infusing human alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide were studied in eight patients with congestive heart failure, five normal rabbits and five rabbits with adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.
 In patients with heart failure, calcitonin gene-related peptide caused a dose-dependent increase in cardiac output and decrease in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure.
 The systemic blood pressure and right atrial and pulmonary wedge pressures decreased only at the highest infusion rate (16 ng/kg per min).
 Heart rate remained unchanged.
 Plasma epinephrine increased (p less than 0.05), whereas aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide and prolactin concentrations decreased (p less than 0.05).
 Plasma norepinephrine, renin activity, cortisol and growth hormone concentrations remained unchanged.
 In both groups of rabbits, the drug decreased blood pressure and increased cardiac output and heart rate.
 There was a significant increase in renal blood flow (p less than 0.05).
 The peptide did not affect the contraction amplitude of human and rabbit ventricular myocytes.
 These findings suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide is a vasodilator in the rabbit and humans with little direct effect on ventricular myocardium.

 To investigate the influence of orifice geometry on the three-dimensional shape of jets, an in vitro Doppler color flow study was performed.
 Jets were formed by discharging blood through round orifices and through orifices with major/minor axis ratios of 2:1, 3:1 and 5:1.
 These were repeated with orifice areas of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 cm2.
 For turbulent and laminar jets formed by these orifices, Doppler color flow images were obtained from two orthogonal scanning planes aligned with the major and minor orifice axes.
 Jet width was measured at 1 cm intervals from 0 to 5 cm from the orifice and used to calculate jet eccentricity (ratio of major to minor axis widths) and the rate of divergence of the jet walls.
 Jets were observed to diverge more rapidly along walls aligned with the orifice minor axis rather than along the major axis.
 This differential spreading led to the development of circular symmetry at a short distance from the orifice.
 Jet divergence (theta) occurred more rapidly for turbulent jets and for jets formed by larger orifices: theta (zero) = 0.80 + 6.3.A + 7.0.T + 0.47.E-OR (r = 95, p less than 0.0001, n = 48), where A is orifice area (cm2); T is 0 for laminar jets, 1 for turbulent jets and E-OR combines orifice eccentricity and scanning orientation, ranging from -5 for 5:1 orifices imaged along the major axis, 0 for circular orifices to 5 for 5:1 orifices imaged along the minor axis.
 Within the jet, eccentricity decayed approximately exponentially with distance from the orifice, more rapidly for turbulent jets, more slowly for the larger and more eccentric orifices.

 ER, SA, and LC did not alter patient management.
 Thirty-four patients had serum sodium, 36 potassium, and 33 chloride and bicarbonate determinations.
 Sodium, potassium, and chloride levels were uniformly normal; bicarbonate and leukocyte counts were uniformly abnormal in initial evaluations.

882,"Intravascular ultrasound imaging of human coronary arteries in vivo. Analysis of tissue characterizations with comparison to in vitro histological specimens.
 BACKGROUND.
 Intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed in 27 patients after coronary balloon angioplasty to quantify the lumen and atheroma cross-sectional areas.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 A 20-MHz ultrasound catheter was inserted through a 1.6-mm plastic introducer sheath across the dilated area to obtain real-time images at 30 times/sec.
 The ultrasound images distinguished the lumen from atheroma, calcification, and the muscular media.
 The presence of dissection between the media and the atheroma was well visualized.
 These observations of tissue characterization were compared with an in vitro study of 20 human atherosclerotic artery segments that correlated the ultrasound images to histological preparations.
 The results indicate that high-quality intravascular ultrasound images under controlled in vitro conditions can provide accurate microanatomic information about the histological characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques.
 Similar quality cross-sectional ultrasound images were also obtained in human coronary arteries in vivo.
 Quantitative analysis of the ultrasound images from the clinical studies revealed that the mean cross-sectional lumen area after balloon angioplasty was 5.0 +/- 2.0 mm2.
 The mean residual atheroma area at the level of the prior dilatation was 8.7 +/- 3.4 mm2, which corresponded to 63% of the available arterial cross-sectional area.
 At the segments of the coronary artery that appeared angiographically normal, the ultrasound images demonstrated the presence of atheroma involving 4.7 +/- 3.2 mm2, which was a mean of 35 +/- 23% of the available area bounded by the media.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Intravascular ultrasound appears to be more sensitive than angiography for demonstrating the presence and extent of atherosclerosis and arterial calcification.
 Intracoronary imaging after balloon angioplasty reveals that a significant amount of atheroma is still present, which may partly explain why the incidence of restenosis is high after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.

 Significant reductions in potassium excretion (control 100 +/- 11 mmol/day vs 69 +/- 6 with GH; p less than 0.01) and phosphorus excretion (31 +/- 5 mmol/day vs 18 +/- 3; p less than 0.025) also occurred during GH.
 The protein-conserving effects of GH were sustained during several weeks of treatment.
 Growth hormone enhanced the efficiency of administered protein and facilitated nitrogen retention without clinically significant adverse effects in this small patient group.
 Controlled trials are indicated to determine whether use of this anabolic hormone reduces hospitalization time and improves other clinical outcomes in severely injured patients when combined with appropriate nutritional support.

884,"Atrioventricular plane displacement in severe congestive heart failure following dilated cardiomyopathy or myocardial infarction.
 Echocardiographic recording of the atrioventricular (AV) plane displacement during the cardiac cycle was used to assess left ventricular (LV) global function in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).
 The study population consisted of 70 patients with chronic CHF (NYHA functional groups III and IV) following dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or myocardial infarction (MI), and 35 age-matched healthy subjects.
 The AV plane displacement was recorded from the apical 4- and 2-chamber views at four LV sites located about 90 degrees apart and representing the septal, anterior, lateral and posterior parts of the LV wall.
 A mean value was calculated from the above sites (AV-mean).
 Patients with CHF showed a significant generalized reduction of AV plane displacement compared to healthy subjects (5.6 mm vs.
 14.5 mm, P less than 0.001).
 Thirty CHF patients also underwent radionuclide angiography in order to determine the ejection fraction (EF).
 The correlation between AV-mean and EF was good (r = 0.82, P less than 0.001).
 The selection of an AV-mean of less than 7 mm to define a severely depressed LV function (EF less than 30%) gave a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 67%.
 It is concluded that the AV plane displacement can be used to estimate LV systolic function in patients with CHF.

 An understanding of the importance of various risk factors, the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia, and the appropriate use of various noninvasive and invasive tests is essential for management of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).
 Although coronary angiography remains the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis of CAD, much of the data obtained from risk factor assessment, medical history, and various noninvasive tests provides information that may be even more important than cardiac catheterization data alone for defining prognosis and directing management.

 A prospective study of 18 patients who underwent noncardiac surgery was performed to study the use of ketamine as an analgesic during total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol.
 A comparison was made with the combination propofol/fentanyl.
 The propofol/ketamine combination resulted in haemodynamically stable anaesthesia without the need for additional analgesics.
 Postoperative behaviour was normal in all patients and none of the patients reported dreaming during or after the operation.
 Propofol seems to be effective in eliminating side effects of a subanaesthetic dose of ketamine in humans.
 We recommend the propofol/ketamine combination for total intravenous anaesthesia for surgery when stable haemodynamics are required.

887,"Genetic mechanisms of tumor suppression by the human p53 gene.
 Mutations of the gene encoding p53, a 53-kilodalton cellular protein, are found frequently in human tumor cells, suggesting a crucial role for this gene in human oncogenesis.
 To model the stepwise mutation or loss of both p53 alleles during tumorigenesis, a human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, was used that completely lacked endogenous p53.
 Single copies of exogenous p53 genes were then introduced by infecting cells with recombinant retroviruses containing either point-mutated or wild-type versions of the p53 cDNA sequence.
 Expression of wild-type p53 suppressed the neoplastic phenotype of Saos-2 cells, whereas expression of mutated p53 conferred a limited growth advantage to cells in the absence of wild-type p53.
 Wild-type p53 was phenotypically dominant to mutated p53 in a two-allele configuration.
 These results suggest that, as with the retinoblastoma gene, mutation of both alleles of the p53 gene is essential for its role in oncogenesis.

888,"The nature and course of olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the specific nature and course of olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
 Previous studies had noted impaired odor identification, but there was no unanimity about the presence of odor detection deficits.
 METHOD: Odor identification was tested in 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 57 elderly control subjects by using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test.
 Odor detection was assessed in 46 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and 40 control subjects by using a forced-choice threshold test with geraniol as the odorant.
 RESULTS: Significant deficits in olfactory identification were present in subjects who were in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment, and these deficits increased as Alzheimer's disease progressed.
 There was some overlap in individual smell identification test scores between cognitively impaired patients and normal elderly subjects.
 On the other hand, odor detection deficits did not appear until Alzheimer's disease was relatively advanced.
 Smell identification test scores were correlated with Mini-Mental State scores, but geraniol detection was not.
 CONCLUSIONS: Odor identification is impaired early in Alzheimer's disease and may be more influenced by cognitive status than is acuity of odor detection, which is not altered until later in the disorder.
 The pattern of hyposmia in Alzheimer's disease suggests that the disorder may not ""begin in the nose,"" as has been theorized previously.
 Further refinement of olfactory testing may be useful in the diagnostic evaluation of early dementia.

889,"The occurrence of accessory immunologic cells in bone induction.
 The differentiating tissues in fracture healing and in demineralized bone-powder-induced (DBP) bone formation were investigated with monoclonal antibodies with respect to the occurrence of Ia-positive cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes with interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2).
 Ia refers to molecules on the cell surface belonging to Class II of the major histocompatibility complex and is specific for the species and the individual.
 In both types of granulation tissues (fracture healing and following DBP implantation), the mesenchymal cells from the surrounding musculature were accompanied by large numbers of Ia-positive cells and common macrophages.
 The occurrence of IL-2 receptors was sparse in fracture healing but rich in DBP induction, probably because of its immunogenic properties, though weak.
 On Day 7, almost all existing cells in DBP induction were Ia-positive, signifying an immunologic effector phase apparently directed to the remaining still-passive bone powder in the periphery, while the central part of the inserted bone powder was producing cartilaginous cells and matrix.
 The presence of accessory immunologic cells in fracture healing is perhaps due to a surveillance function (a standard response on injury), but the cell differentiation might also be dependent on the active mediators emitted from Ia-positive cells and macrophages.
 This investigation strengthens the concept that induced bone development occurs in experimental fracture healing.

 Post-resectional hyperplasia is the phenomenon in which residual small bowel increases in size and absorptive capacity after segmental enterectomy.
 This experiment studied the effect of somatostatin analogue therapy on the development of two structural parameters of post-resectional hyperplasia in rats subjected to 40% proximal small bowel resection.
 Octreotide acetate-treated rats failed to develop increased villus height (902 +/- 50 microns) relative to saline-treated rats (1,103 +/- 98 microns).
 Augmentation of residual intestinal weight was also significantly impaired in analogue-treated rats (92 +/- 3 versus 118 +/- 5 mg/cm).
 We conclude that somatostatin analogue treatment during the early postoperative period does impair the growth of residual bowel in rats.
 These findings raise concern regarding the use of this drug for postoperative patients who have undergone massive small bowel resection in whom the process of post-resectional adaptation may be critical to allow sustenance with enteral nutrition.

 Reports from the United Kingdom have described increases in leukemia and lymphoma among young persons living near certain nuclear installations.
 Because of concerns raised by these reports, a mortality survey was conducted in populations living near nuclear facilities in the United States.
 All facilities began service before 1982.
 Over 900,000 cancer deaths occurred from 1950 through 1984 in 107 counties with or near nuclear installations.
 Each study county was matched for comparison to three ""control counties"" in the same region.
 There were 1.8 million cancer deaths in the 292 control counties during the 35 years studied.
 Deaths due to leukemia or other cancers were not more frequent in the study counties than in the control counties.
 For childhood leukemia mortality, the relative risk comparing the study counties with their controls before plant start-up was 1.08, while after start-up it was 1.03.
 For leukemia mortality at all ages, the relative risks were 1.02 before start-up and 0.98 after.
 For counties in two states, cancer incidence data were also available.
 For one facility, the standardized registration ratio for childhood leukemia was increased significantly after start-up.
 However, the increase also antedated the operation of this facility.
 The study is limited by the correlational approach and the large size of the geographic areas (counties) used.
 It does not prove the absence of any effect.
 If, however, any excess cancer risk was present in US counties with nuclear facilities, it was too small to be detected with the methods employed.

 A review of nine studies of prophylactic knee braces worn by players in American tackle football lends some support for the use of double-hinged braces at the high-school level.
 Evidence for their use at the college level seems less persuasive.
 Caution should be exercised in interpreting these studies owing to the probable presence of bias and confounding variables and to difficulty in generalizing results beyond the study populations.
 The two studies that assigned braces randomly found lower injury rates for knees and knee ligaments among high-school and high-school size players.
 Conversely, a large, multiteam collegiate study found a significantly higher rate of knee injuries among brace users, a difference that remained when controlled for position, skill, and previous injury.

 T-associated maternal effect (Tme) is the only known maternal-effect mutation in the mouse.
 The defect is nuclear-encoded and embryos that inherit a deletion of the Tme locus from their mother die at day 15 of gestation.
 There are many genomically imprinted regions known in the mouse genome but so far no imprinted genes have been cloned.
 The Tme locus is absent in two chromosome-17 deletion mutants, Thp and the tLub2, and its position has been localized using these deletions to a 1-cM region.
 We report here that the genes for insulin-like growth factor type-2 receptor (Igf2r) and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase-2 (Sod-2) are absent from both deletions.
 Probes for these genes and for plasminogen (Plg) and T-complex peptide 1 (Tcp-1) were used in pulsed-field gel mapping to show that Tme must lie within a region of 800-1,100 kb.
 We also demonstrate that embryos express Igf2r only from the maternal chromosome, and that Tcp-1, Plg and Sod-2 are expressed from both chromosomes.
 Therefore Igf2r is imprinted and closely linked or identical to Tme.

 A randomized, double-blind, crossover study was conducted in 10 patients to assess the effect of nifedipine versus placebo on total ischemic activity and circadian distribution of ischemic episodes.
 After baseline exercise treadmill testing and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic ST-segment monitoring, patients received either nifedipine (mean dose, 80 mg/day) or placebo administered 4 times per day, with the initial dose taken immediately upon arising in the morning.
 Patients were maintained on a stable dose of each study drug for 7 days, after which they underwent repeat exercise treadmill testing and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiography.
 During exercise treadmill testing, greater exercise duration was achieved by patients receiving nifedipine than by those receiving placebo (421 +/- 121 vs 353 +/- 155 seconds, respectively; p less than 0.05).
 Time to greater than or equal to 1 mm ST depression was significantly greater with nifedipine (282 +/- 146 seconds) than at baseline (130 +/- 72 seconds, p less than 0.003) and with placebo (150 +/- 98 seconds, p less than 0.0005).
 During ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, nifedipine reduced both the total number of ischemic episodes (18 vs 54 at baseline and 63 with placebo; p less than 0.02 for both) and the total duration of ischemia (260 vs 874 at baseline and 927 minutes with placebo; p less than 0.02 for both).
 The surge of ischemia between 06:00 and 12:00 noted at baseline and during placebo therapy was nearly abolished during nifedipine treatment.

 All patients were hospitalized with conclusive ultrasonic evidence of deep venous thrombosis identified in one of four levels: I, calf only; II, calf-popliteal; III, calf-popliteal-femoral; or IV, calf-popliteal-femoral-iliac.
 Duplex scans were obtained on admission and on three subsequent occasions during therapy.
 Progression of thrombosis was defined as advancement of thrombus to the more proximal venous level.
 Demographic data, symptoms, risk factors for deep venous thrombosis, physical findings, anticoagulation regimens, and hematologic variables were ascertained.
 Adequacy of anticoagulation was defined as elevation of baseline activated partial thromboplastin time by 150%.
 Nine patients (38%) had progression of thrombosis, and 15 (62%) had stable or improving duplex scans.
 Progression occurred as follows: I----II (2), I----III (2), II----III (1), and III----IV (4).
 Of the demographic and clinical variables examined, only smoking correlated with progression of thrombus (p = 0.04).
 Average heparin dose in the stable group was 1214 +/- 294 units/hr and 1122 +/- 248 units/hr in the group that progressed (p = 0.8): activated partial thromboplastin time was 45.6 +/- 7 seconds in the stable group and 49.8 +/- 9 seconds in the progression group (p = 0.7).
 Nine patients in the stable group had consistently adequate anticoagulation, whereas six did not; six in the progression group were consistently anticoagulated, and three were not.

 A significant increase was observed in the levels of TSA, LSA, mucoid proteins, and PBH in OC patients compared with controls, normal tobacco chewers, and patients with oral PC.
 Increasing levels of all the biomarkers were found with progression of the malignant disease.
 Elevations in the levels of TSA and LSA were statistically significant in Stage IV patients compared with Stage III patients.
 The patients with metastases had higher levels of the biomarkers than the patients with primary OC.
 However, elevations only in LSA levels were statistically significant.
 These results suggest that evaluations of the serum glycoconjugate levels may be useful in diagnosis of the patients with oral PC or OC.

 Human erythroblastic precursor cells adhere to fibronectin (Fn) but the exact nature of the receptors mediating this interaction has not been characterized.
 In this study, we report data showing that immature human erythroblasts express the integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 and that both these molecules act as fibronectin receptors on these cells.
 We have recently demonstrated that adhesion to Fn of purified human CFU-E and their immediate progeny preproerythroblasts was inhibited by antibodies directed against the human fibronectin receptor (VLA-5).
 Here we have extended those results and characterized by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies the integrins expressed on surface-labeled normal human immature erythroblasts.
 A polyclonal antibody recognizing the common VLA beta 1 subunit yielded two polypeptides of 120 and 160 kD.
 Our data further demonstrate that the polypeptide of 160 kD contains alpha subunits corresponding to both alpha 4 and alpha 5.
 Thus, erythroblast lysates prepared in 0.3% CHAPS and immunoprecipitated with antibodies which specifically recognize the alpha 4 subunit showed a heterodimer with peptides of 120 (beta 1) and 160 kD (alpha 4) and the additional peptides of 70 and 80 kD which usually coprecipitate with the alpha 4 chain.
 On the other hand, specific anti-alpha 5 antibodies immunoprecipitated an alpha 5/beta 1 complex with peptides of 120 and 160 kD which under reducing conditions migrated as a single band of 130 kD.
 Similar experiments performed with an erythroleukemic cell line (KU 812) showed that these cells also coexpress both the VLA-4 and VLA-5 members of the integrin family.
 Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies recognizing the VLA alpha 4 chain blocked the adhesion of immature erythroblasts to Fn-coated surfaces, thus demonstrating that, as VLA-5, VLA-4 is also a functional Fn receptor on these cells.

 To further understand the molecular mechanisms and the biological indicators of colonic tumorigenesis, the authors examined tyrosine kinase activity in the cytosol and in the particulate fraction of the homogenates of specimens from 20 human colonic carcinomas and compared them with the adjacent normal mucosal tissues.
 Total protein tyrosine kinase activity could be precisely detected using miniphosphocellulose column purification and a synthetic peptide, Glu-asparagine (Asp)-alanine (Ala)-Glu-tyrosine (Tyr)-Ala-Ala-arginine (Arg)-Arg-Arg-glycine (Gly) (E11-G1), as an artificial substrate.
 Tyrosine kinase activity of colonic carcinoma and normal mucosa was reduced in the cytosol fraction whereas activity in the particulate fraction was elevated with respect to protein concentration.
 The average specific activity ratios were 1.95 +/- 0.27 (normal cytosolic/carcinoma cytosolic) and 0.57 +/- 0.01 (normal particulate/carcinoma particulate) for tyrosine kinase activity.
 Cellular distribution (% cytosol) of tyrosine kinase activity in normal mucosa and in carcinoma varied from 21.0% to 91.2% and from 7.0% to 61.4%, respectively.
 In nearly all cases the percentage of cytosolic tyrosine kinase activity in carcinoma tissues was lower than in normal tissues.
 There was no difference due to histologic type or the presence of adenomatous components.
 A significant decrease of cytosolic tyrosine kinases was correlated with Dukes' Stage A.
 With advancing Dukes' stage, the average specific activity ratios (normal cytosol/carcinoma cytosol) were decreased.
 This study indicates that colonic carcinogenesis might be associated with alterations in cellular levels of tyrosine kinase activity and that the average specific activity ratio (normal cytosol/carcinoma cytosol) had a possible correlation with colonic tumor growth.

 To determine the factors that influence the presence of collateral vessels during coronary occlusion, we performed standardized contrast injection of the contralateral coronary artery in 58 consecutive patients, without previous myocardial infarction, undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for 1-vessel disease (left anterior descending artery in 45, right coronary artery: in 10 and left circumflex artery in 3).
 The presence of collateral vessels during coronary occlusion, defined as partial or complete epicardial opacification by collateral vessels of the vessel dilated, was related to clinical, angiographic and electrocardiographic parameters.
 The angiographic appearance of collateral vessels during balloon inflation showed a weak, although statistically significant, correlation to the percent diameter stenosis before angioplasty (r = 0.28; p = 0.03) and the duration of angina (r = 0.37; p = 0.004).
 By combining lesion severity with the duration of angina, collateral vessels during coronary occlusion were particularly related to a lesion severity greater than or equal to 70% and duration of angina greater than or equal to 3 months (p less than 0.001).
 Furthermore, the presence of collateral vessels was associated with an absence of ST-segment shift (greater than or equal to 1 mm) during 1 minute of coronary occlusion (p less than 0.001).

 End diastolic flow velocity just beneath the aortic isthmus was measured within 72 hours of cardiac catheterisation by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 30 controls and 61 patients with aortic regurgitation.
 The end diastolic flow velocity was determined at the peak R wave on a simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram.
 In all controls there was no reverse flow at the end diastole beneath the aortic isthmus.
 In patients with aortic regurgitation the end diastolic flow velocity correlated well with the angiographic grade of regurgitation (r = 0.81) and regurgitant fraction (r = 0.82).
 The mean (SD) values were 6.3 (5.2), 12.2 (4.3), 22.1 (5.7), and 34.3 (9.3) cm/s for patients with regurgitant fraction of less than 20%, between 20% and 40%, between 41% and 60%, and greater than 60%, respectively.

 Although slight statistical differences in relative percentages of CD2 and CD3 lymphocytes were observed, these differences were probably not clinically significant.
 These data indicate that the rapid technique provides a standardized method for enumerating T and B lymphocytes in peripheral blood.

912,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor synergizes with interleukin-6 in supporting the proliferation of human myeloma cells.
 The role of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the growth of multiple myeloma (MM) was investigated in 21 patients with MM.
 In 17 patients with proliferating myeloma cells in vivo, recombinant GM-CSF significantly increased the endogenous-IL-6-mediated spontaneous myeloma cell proliferation occurring in 5-day cultures of tumor cells in vitro (P less than .01).
 Furthermore, GM-CSF was detected in 5-day culture supernatants of myeloma bone marrow cells.
 This endogenous GM-CSF was produced by the myeloma bone marrow microenvironment but not by myeloma cells and contributed to the spontaneous myeloma-cell proliferation observed in 5-day cultures.
 In fact, this proliferation was partially blocked (67%) by anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibodies.
 The stimulatory effect of rGM-CSF was mediated through IL-6 because it was abrogated by anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies.
 rGM-CSF did not reproducibly increase the endogenous IL-6 production in short-term cultures of bone marrow cells of MM patients.
 Using an IL-6-dependent myeloma cell line (XG-1 cell line), rGM-CSF was shown to act directly on myeloma cells stimulating by twofold their IL-6 responsiveness.
 rGM-CSF did not induce any IL-6 production in XG-1 cells, nor was it able to sustain their growth alone.
 Although no detectable GM-CSF levels were found in the peripheral or bone marrow blood of MM patients, it is possible that GM-CSF, produced locally by the tumoral environment, enhances the IL-6 responsiveness of myeloma cells in vivo in a way similar to that reported here in vitro.

 To investigate the possibility that cutaneous T-cell lymphomas of large cell type may be associated with human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I infection in nonendemic regions, tissue samples from six cases of large cell cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and four cases of small cell cutaneous T-cell lymphoma were screened for the presence of integrated proviral human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I DNA.
 Combined use of Southern blot hybridization and enzymatic DNA amplification revealed human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I-specific sequences in all cases of large cell cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and in none of the cases of small cell cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
 These results suggest that in nonendemic areas, a significant proportion of large cell cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cases are associated with human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I.

 We reviewed our experience with 2,809 DPL's and 1,331 CT's obtained in the resuscitative phase over a 3-year period in our trauma system to determine the significant complications associated with each modality.
 There were 25 DPL complications: eight false negatives, three false positives, and 14 technical errors.
 There were 46 CT complications including 25 false negative scans, three false positive scans, and 18 delays to the operating room from obtaining abdominal CT evaluation, with two of these delays resulting in preventable deaths.
 Although both modalities had low complication rates (0.9% DPL vs.

 A rabbit model of hind limb ischemia was designed to demonstrate that new, hemodynamically significant arterial connections will develop between ischemic skeletal muscle and an independently perfused muscle pedicle flap.
 The right common iliac artery was divided in 15 rabbits.
 In eight rabbits a muscle flap based on the left deep inferior epigastric artery was transposed to the right thigh (flap group).
 In seven rabbits a sham operation was performed where the flap was sutured to the abdominal wall (sham group).
 After 7 days angiography demonstrated arterial connections between the flap and the native limb circulation in all of the flap group animals.
 The flap increased muscle perfusion in the ischemic limb (2.99 ml/100 gm muscle/minute in the flap group, vs 2.06 ml/100 gm muscle/minute in the sham group, p less than 0.005).
 Hemodynamically significant vascular connections will develop between a well-perfused muscle flap and an ischemic limb.

 The relation between left ventricular diastolic abnormalities and myocardial blood flow during ischemia was studied in eight open chest dogs with critical stenoses of the proximal left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries.
 The heart was paced at 1.7 times the heart rate at rest for 3 min.
 In dogs with coronary stenoses, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased from 8 +/- 1 to 14 +/- 2 mm Hg during pacing tachycardia (p less than 0.01) and 16 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) after pacing, with increased end-diastolic and end-systolic segment lengths in the ischemic regions.
 Left ventricular diastolic pressure-segment length relations for ischemic regions shifted upward during and after pacing tachycardia in dogs with coronary stenoses, indicating decreased regional diastolic distensibility.
 In dogs without coronary stenoses, the left ventricular diastolic pressure-segment length relation was unaltered.
 Pacing tachycardia without coronary stenoses induced an increase in anterograde coronary blood flow (assessed by flow meter) in both the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries, and a decrease in regional vascular resistance.
 In dogs with coronary stenoses, regional vascular resistance before pacing was decreased by 18%; myocardial blood flow (assessed by microspheres) was unchanged in both the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary artery territories.
 During pacing tachycardia with coronary stenoses, regional coronary vascular resistance did not decrease further; subendocardial myocardial blood flow distal to the left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis decreased (from 1.03 +/- 0.07 to 0.67 +/- 0.12 ml/min per g, p less than 0.01), as did subendocardial to subepicardial blood flow ratio (from 1.04 +/- 0.09 to 0.42 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.01).

 PURPOSE: Prostacyclin, a potent inhibitor of platelet function and vasodilator, has been used to treat peripheral vascular disease.
 The aim of this study was to monitor the thrombotic status of patients treated by infusion of a stable prostacyclin analogue, iloprost.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with peripheral vascular disease underwent iloprost infusion for 3 days (8 hours each day) in a dose ranging from 0.5 to 2 ng/kg/minute.
 Variable parameters of thrombosis such as platelet reactivity (shear-induced hemostatic plug formation and thrombus formation on a collagen fiber), coagulation, and spontaneous thrombolysis (dislodgment of hemostatic plugs) were measured from non-anticoagulated blood samples by hemostatometry immediately before and 1 hour after the infusion and on the last day, 4 hours after initiation of the infusion.
 RESULTS: Analysis of data from all patients 1 hour after the infusion showed no changes in platelet reactivity and spontaneous thrombolysis, but coagulation was significantly enhanced.
 In four patients, significant platelet hyperreactivity was observed after the infusion.
 Four of the five patients tested while undergoing iloprost infusion showed an enhanced thrombotic reaction and markedly enhanced coagulation.
 Iloprost employed in vitro in a concentration that corresponds to the therapeutic peak blood level caused no inhibition of platelet function but significantly enhanced coagulation.
 The threshold in vitro iloprost concentration at which anti-platelet effect and increased spontaneous thrombolysis were observed was twice that of the therapeutic blood level.
 CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the view that antagonism of platelet function is an important factor of iloprost therapy.
 Furthermore, platelet hyperreactivity in some patients and markedly enhanced coagulation during and after infusion of iloprost in general, represent a risk of thromboembolism, especially as patients are already in a prethrombotic condition.

 A patient with inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver associated with acute myelomonocytic leukemia (M4) is reported.
 He had spiking fever, epigastralgia, and elevated levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).
 Ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic mass in the liver, and ultrasonically guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of the mass revealed that it was composed of fibrous connective tissue infiltrated with plasma cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils.
 Accordingly, a diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver was made.
 Marked reduction in the size of the lesion and a decrease of the levels of the CRP and ALP occurred without specific treatment.
 We emphasize the importance of ultrasonically guided aspiration biopsy in diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver without the need for surgery.

920,"The effect of the gastrin receptor antagonist proglumide on survival in gastric carcinoma.
 Gastric cancer remains a disease with a very poor prognosis, and there is no safe and effective form of therapy for advanced disease.
 Evidence is now abundant to show that gastrin stimulates the growth of both gastric and colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and that blockade of gastrin receptors can prolong survival in xenografted nude mice.
 We have thus performed a randomized, controlled study of the gastrin/cholecystokinin receptor antagonist proglumide as therapy in 110 patients with gastric carcinoma.
 Proglumide had no overall effect on survival (Mantel-Cox statistic = 0.5, P = 0.48).
 The 95% confidence interval for the proglumide treated group was 260 to 474 days compared to 230 to 372 days for the control group.
 No significant difference was seen with proglumide, which has a relatively low affinity with the gastrin receptor and also has partial agonist activity.
 Drugs that are far more specific and potent gastrin receptor antagonists are becoming available, which may have a greater effect on survival, and further clinical trials of such compounds are clearly indicated to determine the efficacy of hormonal control of gastrointestinal malignancy.

 The purpose of this study was to examine changes in subsite distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer within different age groups.
 Registration of colorectal cancer by the National Cancer Registry of New Zealand approached 100 percent by 1974.
 The present study was based on 15,395 individuals aged 25 years and over and registered for colorectal cancer between 1974 and 1983.
 Subsite distribution (right colon, left colon, rectum) for different age groups (25-49, 50-69, 70+ years) was significantly skewed, with an excess of right colonic cancer in individuals aged 25-49 years and 70+ years.
 This right colonic excess was accompanied by a relative reduction in left colonic cancer.
 Age adjusted incidence rates for the periods 1974-78 and 1979-83 were compared and stratified by age group and subsite.
 Incidence rates increased in all subsites in individuals aged 50+ years.
 This was particularly evident for right sided cancer in the elderly of both sexes.
 There was a marked reduction in the incidence of left colonic cancer and rectal cancer in individuals under 50 years.
 In contrast, the incidence of right colonic cancer remained relatively stable in young individuals.
 Time trend studies indicate that the skewed subsite distribution of large bowel cancer in different age groups may increase with time and is probably due to varying etiological factors acting on different cohorts.

 We present two cases with acute onset of vertical gaze palsy, mainly consisting of impaired downgaze and apraxia of downward head movements, together with neuropsychological deficits (hypersomnia, impaired attention and disorders of memory and affective control).
 CT and MRI revealed bilateral post-ischaemic lesions in the dorsomedial thalamus and the mesodiencephalic junction, dorsomedial to the red nucleus, thus being restricted to the territory of the posterior thalamosubthalamic paramedian artery, which includes the region of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle as the main premotor nucleus for the generation of vertical saccades.
 In our patients, oculographic examination with electro-oculography and magnetic search coil recording showed severe impairment of downward more than upward saccades and only minor deficits of vertical pursuit and the vestibulo-ocular reflex.
 Visual functions were normal, with one exception: a psychophysical test of motion perception revealed a significant deficit in the detection of vertical movements.
 This could be due to a central adaptive mechanism which, in order to minimize oscillopsia, might elevate thresholds for vertical motion perception in cases of vertical gaze palsy.
 As an alternative explanation, lesions within the midbrain tegmentum could have damaged subcortical visual pathways involved in motion perception.

 CBZ total concentrations were reduced during active FBM treatment (mean reduction 25%, range 10-42%, p less than 0.001).
 The effect was evident after the first week of treatment and reached a plateau in 2-4 weeks.
 To clarify the interaction mechanism, free and total concentrations of CBZ and its plasma metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultrafiltration in four patients.
 In these patients, FBM treatment reduced CBZ concentrations and increased CBZ-epoxide (CBZ-E) concentrations (p less than 0.01).
 Free fractions of all compounds were unmodified.
 FBM appears to be capable of inducing CBZ metabolism.

 In the majority of patients whose primary tumors have continued to elude detection, the extensive use of diagnostic imaging studies fails to produce information that alters the patients' clinical course.
 Rare exceptions will be cited, but these exceptions prove the general rule.
 Imaging studies should therefore be targeted for selected patients with disseminated malignancies in whom identification of their primary tumors could benefit quality of life or length of survival.

 Dramatic cellular changes that occur during hepatocarcinogenesis are associated with major alterations in extracellular matrix formation and in the relationships between cells and their microenvironment.
 We have studied the expression of laminin, the major noncollagenous glycoprotein of basement membrane, and the laminin receptor 32 kD laminin-binding protein in two rat (Faza 967 and HTC) and two human (HepG2 and HBGC2) hepatoma cell lines that express a variety of liver-specific functions.
 Laminin was found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of these cells when the indirect immunoperoxidase method and electron microscopic examination were used.
 Radiolabeled laminin, immunoprecipitated from both media and cell extracts, was resolved by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel in two major polypeptides that comigrated with the A and B subunits from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor laminin.
 Immunoblot analysis showed that the Mr = 400,000 polypeptide did not correspond to the A subunit of laminin.
 Northern blot analyses demonstrated large amounts of B1 and B2 mRNAs but no A chain mRNA.
 We conclude that the tumor cells produce the laminin B chains only.
 In contrast, normal adult hepatocytes from either man or rat lacked laminin mRNAs, whereas in 1-day primary culture, B chain mRNAs became detectable.
 The steady-state level of 32 kD laminin-binding protein mRNA was 10-fold and threefold higher in rat hepatoma cells than in freshly isolated and 1-day cultured normal rat hepatocytes, respectively.
 In human hepatocytes, the steady-state levels of 32 kD laminin-binding protein mRNAs varied depending on the donor and never reached the level of the human hepatoma cells.

 This study attempts to show that tolerance to alcohol is in large part a ""learned"" response, precipitated by contextual cues predictive of the unconditional drug effect.
 It also aims to show that the contextual cues integral to such ""environment-dependent"" tolerance function to increase motivational desire to drink alcohol.
 Male students (N = 40), drinking on average 10-20 units of alcohol per week, were randomly assigned to one of four groups.
 Two groups ingested 1.2ml/kg alcohol: one (AL-EXPT) with exteroceptive contextual cues typically associated with alcohol use, and the other (AL-UNEXPT) in a context not normally associated with alcohol.
 A third group (placebo) believed that they were drinking alcohol but, in fact, consumed a nonalcoholic beverage in the alcohol-expected context.
 The fourth group drank juice in the alcohol-unexpected context.
 As predicted, tolerance to the deleterious effects of alcohol on cognition and motor-performance, and subjective desire to consume alcohol, were influenced by the alcohol-predictive contextual cues.
 A physiological index (pulse rate) also tended to confirm that these cues elicited a conditioned compensatory response to alcohol.
 The implications of these findings for tolerance to and motivation to drink alcohol in a nonpathological population are discussed.

 Of 255 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction, 111 were eligible for attempted late thrombolysis.
 They were randomly assigned to either thrombolytic and antithrombotic treatment (treatment group) or routine treatment (control group).
 Patients in the treatment group received streptokinase initiated late (mean 32 hours; range 12 to 49) after the onset of symptoms, followed by heparin infusion for at least 5 days and warfarin and dipyridamole for at least 3 months.
 Patients were examined clinically and by bicycle ergometry on discharge from the hospital and after 3 and 12 months.
 The two groups did not differ with respect to deaths or reinfarctions.
 There was a trend toward a lower incidence of angina pectoris in the treatment group.
 Exercise tolerance in this group was significantly higher than in the control group (at 3 months 124 +/- 39 W vs 107 +/- 41 W; p less than 0.05).
 The difference was entirely accounted for by patients with no previous history of infarction or angina pectoris (at 3 months 142 +/- 37 W vs 112 +/- 45 W; p = 0.01).
 ECG signs of myocardial ischemia, silent or symptomatic, occurred at significantly lower levels of exercise among patients in the control group compared with patients in the treatment group.

932,"Acute tolerance in morphine analgesia: continuous infusion and single injection in rats.
 This study aimed to determine whether the decline of the analgesic effect of morphine with a continuous infusion or that after a single injection correlates with the changes in brain concentration of morphine.
 The analgesic effect of morphine and its brain and serum concentrations were determined with a continuous 8-h infusion at a constant rate and after a single subcutaneous injection of the agent.
 The analgesic effect was determined by measuring the threshold of motor response to noxious stimulation.
 Brain and serum concentrations of morphine were detected by radioimmunoassay with the use of 125I-labeled morphine.
 With the constant-rate (4 mg.kg-1.h-1, intravenous) morphine infusion, the peak of analgesia could not be maintained: the increase in the pain threshold at 2 h was 1,003 g and at 8h was 286 g (a decrease in analgesia by 72%, P less than 0.0002).
 At the same time, the brain morphine concentration tended to increase, to 278 ng/g at 2 h and 329 ng/g at 8 h.
 After the single morphine injection (6 mg/kg, subcutaneous), recovery from analgesia occurred at a much faster rate than did the decrease in morphine brain concentration; the decrease in pain threshold was 79% at 90 vs.
 30 min after the injection (P less than 0.0001), and the corresponding decrease in brain concentration was 28% (NS).
 The absence of correlation between analgesia and morphine brain concentration both with the constant-rate morphine infusion and after the single injection suggests the development of acute tolerance, which is pharmacodynamic in nature.

 Hepatomas are a common malignancy in countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis B virus infections.
 These tumors may present with severe persistent hypoglycemia.
 We have studied the possible relationship of production of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) by these tumors and the development of hypoglycemia.
 Mean IGF-II concentration was not significantly higher in 23 patients with hypoglycemia than in nine patients with euglycemia (542 +/- 61 [SE] micrograms/L vs 382 +/- 52 micrograms/L).
 Serum IGF-I was more suppressed in patients with hypoglycemia (16 +/- 3 micrograms/L) than in patients with euglycemia (57 +/- 18 micrograms/L).
 Because an increased percentage of IGF-II in serum of patients with hypoglycemia who have other tumors is present as partially processed pro-IGF-II (""big"" IGF-II), we passed sera of patients with hypoglycemia and patients with euglycemia with hepatomas through acidic Bio-Gel P-60 columns.
 We found that 57% +/- 4.6% of the IGF-II in sera from patients with hypoglycemia was present as big IGF-II compared with 22% +/- 3% in patients with euglycemia with hepatomas (not significantly different from that in normal controls).
 Four of 11 apparently healthy control subjects who were hepatitis B virus positive also had increased percentages of big IGF-II, suggesting that abnormal processing of pro-IGF-II may result from subtle changes in liver function with this infection.
 It remains to be determined whether these subjects with increased big IGF-II are at increased risk for the development of hepatomas.
 In conclusion, we have confirmed marked suppression of IGF-I in the sera of patients with hepatoma and hypoglycemia.

934,"Preliminary studies for an immunotherapeutic approach to the treatment of human myeloma using chimeric anti-CD38 antibody.
 Multiple myeloma is a disease in which conventional chemotherapy has only limited value, but which may be ideal for treatment with passive antibody against a suitable cell surface antigen on the neoplastic plasma cell.
 The CD38 antigen is known to be present on the majority of neoplastic plasma cells, and this was confirmed by detailed examination of bone marrow aspirates from three patients.
 Strong expression of CD38 was confined to cells which, by the criteria of light-scattering profiles and possession of cytoplasmic Ig, were plasma cells.
 The vast majority of neoplastic plasma cells appeared to be involved.
 Using a cell line as a model, it was found that the CD38 antigen acts as a target for a chimeric antibody prepared from the antibody OKT10.
 The chimeric antibody consists of the Fab portion of the mouse monoclonal antibody linked by a stable thioether bond to an Fc molecule derived from human IgG1, thereby forming mouse Fab-human Fc.
 In contrast to the parent antibody, the chimeric molecule mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) very efficiently with human blood mononuclear effector cells, and is effective at low concentration.
 Also, even though the CD38 antigen is present on natural killer cells, there appears to be little deleterious action of the antibody on effector cell function.
 The antibody also failed to affect the growth of progenitor cells of the granulocyte/macrophage or erythroid lineages present in normal bone marrows, despite the suspicion that these cells express the antigen.
 Other advantages of the CD38 molecule are that it is not found in the serum of patients with myeloma, and it does not appear to modulate in vitro.
 Fourteen patients with florid myeloma and on various chemotherapeutic regimes had an undiminished capacity to mediate ADCC with the chimeric antibody, when compared with normal individuals.
 The maintenance of ADCC activity, coupled with the known suppression of the antibody response in these patients, augers well for treatment with chimeric antibody.

935,"Myocardial temperature during cardiac operations: influence on right ventricular function.
 Maintenance of right heart integrity is frequently neglected during coronary operations.
 Right ventricular dysfunction sometimes limits the success of the surgical procedure, however.
 In addition to the use of cardioplegic solutions, myocardial hypothermia during ischemic cardiac arrest seems to be an important factor for guaranteeing right ventricular performance thereafter.
 This study was designed to measure myocardial temperature in patients with coronary artery disease who have significant stenosis of the right coronary artery in comparison with those who do not have stenosis of the right coronary artery and to evaluate the influence of myocardial temperature on right ventricular hemodynamics after cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Right ventricular function was assessed by thermodilution technique, which allows measurement of right ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular end-diastolic volume, and right ventricular end-systolic volume.
 Right ventricular temperature differed significantly between the two groups, with the lowest value of 15.1 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees C in the group without stenosis of the right coronary artery and a value of 22.2 degrees +/- 2.1 degrees C in the group with stenosis of the right coronary artery.
 Left ventricular and septal temperatures were without group differences within the investigation period.
 Right ventricular hemodynamics were impaired only in the group with stenosis of the right coronary artery with a decrease in right ventricular ejection fraction from 44.2% to 34.1% immediately after termination of bypass and an increase in right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (+38%) and right ventricular end-systolic volume index (+70%).
 Cardiac index decreased only in this group, too (-22.5%).
 Analysis of covariance revealed a significant correlation only between changes in right ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular end-diastolic volume, and right ventricular end-systolic volume and the course of right myocardial temperature.
 It is concluded that right ventricular hypothermia is more difficult to achieve in patients with a diseased right coronary artery.
 Constant myocardial hypothermia, however, seems to be important in guaranteeing right ventricular function, which easily can be evaluated by the thermodilution technique.

936,"Decreased osmotic stability of dystrophin-less muscle cells from the mdx mouse 
 Human X-linked Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are due to defects in dystrophin, the product of an exceptionally large gene.
 Although dystrophin has been characterized as a spectrin-like submembranous cytoskeletal protein, there is no experimental evidence for its function in the structural maintenance of muscle.
 Current hypotheses attribute necrosis of dystrophin-less fibres in situ to mechanical weakening of the outer membrane, to an excessive influx of Ca2+ ions, or to a combination of these two mechanism, possibly mediated by stretch-sensitive ion channels.
 Using hypo-osmotic shock to determine stress resistance and a mouse model (mdx) for the human disease, we show that functional dystrophin contributes to the stability of both cultured myotubes and isolated mature muscle fibres.

 Three groups of 10 ASA 1 patients were studied to determine the incidence of hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation less than or equal to 90%) using pulse oximetry during induction of 'mask' anaesthesia, and whether simple oxygenation techniques could prevent its occurrence.
 We also surveyed all anaesthetists in three major hospitals to ascertain their techniques for this method of anaesthesia.
 Anaesthesia was induced in all patients with thiopentone and maintained with nitrous oxide and isoflurane.
 The first group received 33% oxygen in nitrous oxide as carrier gases, a second group a few normal breaths of 100% oxygen during thiopentone administration followed by 33% oxygen in nitrous oxide, while a third group received 100% oxygen after loss of eyelash reflex until spontaneous breathing was established.
 No patient received positive pressure ventilation before spontaneous breathing was established.
 Six of the 10 patients in the first group became hypoxaemic compared to none in the second group, and three patients became hypoxaemic in the third group.
 Thirty-seven percent of anaesthetists who responded to the survey either did not apply positive pressure ventilation before establishment of spontaneous breathing, or only did so if apnoea was prolonged.
 Only one anaesthetist fully pre-oxygenated patients lungs.
 We conclude that to avoid the likely occurrence of hypoxaemia during induction of mask anaesthesia, a minimum of a few breaths pre-oxygenation is necessary.

 In addition, careful skeletal and muscular reconstruction of the surgical defect is necessary for a successful outcome.
 A new, universal, classification schemata (types I-VI) of shoulder girdle resections has been developed.
 This classification system is based on the bones resected, the status of the abductor mechanism, and the relationship to the glenohumeral joint.
 This system permits easy description and comparison of the various limb-sparing procedures performed.

939,"Neurovascular mechanisms and sodium balance in the pathogenesis of hypertension.
 Physiological studies have clarified the role that the brain has in the interplay between salt balance and hypertension.
 Neural mechanisms and endocrine secretions play a pivotal role in the adaptation of mammals to changes in the intake and excretion of sodium.
 Maneuvers that alter the concentration of sodium in the plasma modify the sensitivity of baroreceptor reflexes and alter vascular reactivity.
 These changes may be mediated in part by the release of vasopressin.
 The research also suggests that the brain indirectly modulates the ability of the vascular endothelium to release vasoactive factors.
 Collectively, these studies illustrate the multiple effects of the sodium ion on the peripheral neural and central endocrine mechanisms that participate in the regulation of arterial pressure.

940,"Cognitive and behavioral effects of the coadministration of dextroamphetamine and haloperidol in schizophrenia.
 OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine if an acute dose of dextroamphetamine might have positive effects on affect and cognition in schizophrenic patients maintained on a regimen of haloperidol and, if so, what variables might predict such improvements.
 METHOD: Twenty-one patients with chronic schizophrenia who were hospitalized on a research ward received a single oral dose of dextroamphetamine (0.25 mg/kg) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.
 All patients were receiving 0.4 mg/kg per day of haloperidol.
 Cognitive tests, motor tests, global ratings, mood ratings, and videotape ratings were used to determine the effect of the coadministration of these drugs.
 Ventricle-brain ratios derived from CT scans were used to predict response to the coadministration of these drugs.
 RESULTS: Amphetamine improved performance on a measure of concept formation on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test but did not result in changes in performance on tests of memory or attention.
 As a group, the patients were more active and performed psychomotor tests more quickly while receiving amphetamine.
 Six patients were judged by clinical raters to have improved in terms of affect, cooperation, and engagement with the environment.
 Improvement was associated with enlarged cerebral ventricles and increases in blink rate from the placebo to the active drug condition.
 No patient unequivocally worsened.
 CONCLUSIONS: These results may be consistent with the theory that coadministration of amphetamine and haloperidol produces relatively selective enhancement of cortical dopaminergic activity.
 However, because of the acute nature of the trial and the specialized research environment in which it was conducted, the authors do not advocate amphetamine as a routine clinical treatment of schizophrenia.

 Adherence to universal blood and body fluid precautions was studied in surgical patient care areas of a university hospital in an effort to identify potentially hazardous health care personnel practices.
 Surgical teams of an 18-unit operating room, three surgical ward patient care teams, and patient care personnel in a 16-bed surgical intensive care unit were observed during routine patient care activities before (study 1) and after (study 2) specific educational programs were held to improve universal precaution compliance.
 Overall, infractions occurred in 57% of 549 observed procedures in study 1 and in 58% of 616 observed procedures in study 2.
 In study 1, infractions occurred in 75% of operating room procedures, 30% of surgical ward procedures, and 75% of surgical intensive care unit procedures.
 Study 2 procedure infraction rates were 81%, 32%, and 40%, respectively.
 Only surgical intensive care unit compliance significantly improved.
 Noncompliance with universal precautions occurs frequently during the care of patients who have undergone surgery, with the type of infraction and specific offender varying according to patient locale.
 These violations appear unamenable to one-time educational efforts.
 Substantial overall improvement may arise from ongoing educational programs directed at specific personnel who care for patients who have undergone surgery.

 After multiple hospital admissions and an inpatient rehabilitation stay, a 68-year-old woman was transferred to our rehabilitation facility with a paraparesis of unknown etiology.
 Previous studies included four CT scans and three MRIs which did not demonstrate the lesion.
 A myelogram was noncharacteristic.
 The correct diagnosis, confirmed by selective angiography, was ultimately contingent upon recognition of the clinical features and natural history of dural spinal cord arteriovenous malformations (SCAVM).
 The unusual combination of this multitude of nondiagnostic imaging studies in the uncommon dural SCAVM served to delay diagnosis and treatment.
 Such delay may have great functional consequences.
 This report illustrates the importance of suspecting SCAVM and recognizing its features.

943,"An overview of randomized trials of sodium reduction and blood pressure 
 To test for effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure and to provide precise estimates of their magnitude, we conducted an overview of randomized clinical trials that aimed to reduce the intake of sodium in human subjects.
 We excluded from pooled analyses trials with confounded designs, those that compared intake levels beyond the usual range in the population, and those without published reports.
 Two reviewers abstracted information in duplicate and differences were reconciled.
 Twenty-three trials with outcome data from an aggregate of 1,536 subjects were included.
 Data were pooled both separately for hypertensive and normotensive subjects and for all trials combined.
 With the use of sample size weighting, blood pressure reductions (net of controls) were 4.9 +/- 1.3/2.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg (systolic and diastolic, respectively, with 95% confidence limits) in hypertensive subjects and 1.7 +/- 1.0/1.0 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in normotensive subjects.
 The combined blood pressure reductions were 2.9 +/- 0.8/1.6 +/- 0.5 mm Hg.
 These changes were associated with mean reduction of urinary sodium excretion ranging from 16 to 171 mmol/24 hr for individual trials.
 A dose-response relation across trials was found, both in normotensive and in hypertensive subjects.
 These results indicate that sodium reduction lowers mean blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals for periods of at least several months.
 The findings are highly consistent with results of observational epidemiological studies and have implications for preventive strategies of blood pressure control.

 Adults and children with brain stem gliomas have a mean survival time of 15 months after radiation therapy (XRT).
 Infants with this tumor present additional complexities for treatment because of possible neurotoxicity of the radiation to the developing brain.
 We report a 15-month-old child with biopsy-proven brain stem glioma with clinical and radiographic evidence of disease progression.
 She was treated with 24 monthly courses of carboplatin without radiation therapy and has had a 39+ month response.
 The clinical response started after 3 months and the radiographic evidence was documented at 10 months by magnetic resonance imaging.
 The toxicity was minimal.
 Longitudinal neuropsychological assessment demonstrated continued improvement at 36 months post diagnosis but with some motor functioning below expected age levels.

945,"Dietary sodium reduction for hypertension prevention and treatment.
 Nutritional-nonpharmacological approaches for the treatment and prevention of hypertension are of great interest.
 Sodium reduction is one of the primary methods recommended for these purposes.
 The general public is interested in the reduction of dietary sodium intake and has responded with a decrease in table salt use, the purchase of lowered sodium food products, and the use of food labels to help guide food purchases.
 Countervailing trends in the use of convenience foods and dining out increase the difficulty for individuals to lower sodium intake.
 Clinical trials that have used sodium reduction alone or in combination with other lifestyle therapies have demonstrated the feasibility of reducing dietary sodium intake from 30% to 50% for up to 4 years, in a variety of populations.
 Trials that used lifestyle and weight loss interventions have also achieved significant reductions in body weight and alcohol consumption and increases in physical activity.
 A variety of studies indicate that long-term sodium reduction is feasible and that it is acceptable to patients.
 No negative consequences of these interventions have been observed, and in some cases improvement in the intake of other nutrients has occurred.
 Nonpharmacological interventions have resulted in hypertension control in significant proportions of the trial populations.
 These studies demonstrate that the foregoing types of interventions can significantly contribute to hypertension treatment and prevention.

 The properties of Wilcoxon's rank sum test for fixed sample size and a Wilcoxon-type two-sample sequential test have been illustrated and compared by means of stochastic simulation.
 Data from a real fixed sample trial have been used, both for resampling from the original data, and for construction of an idealized theoretical distribution.
 The sequential and the fixed sample test obtain equal power, but the sequential test mostly includes considerably fewer patients to reach a conclusion, i.e.
 the mean and median number of patients included are both much lower than the fixed sample size.
 Under the hypotheses only a small fraction of the simulation runs exceed the fixed sample size.
 These findings exemplify results obtained in theoretical analyses and simulation studies covering a wide range of distributions.
 In our opinion sequential tests have obvious advantages and are in many cases better alternatives than fixed sample tests in clinical trials.

947,"Pharmacological characterization of LY233053: a structurally novel tetrazole-substituted competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid antagonist with a short duration of action.
 This study reports the activity of a structurally novel excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, LY233053 [cis-(+-)-4-[(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)methyl]piperidine-2-carboxylic acid], the first tetrazole-containing competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist.
 LY233053 potently inhibited NMDA receptor binding to rat brain membranes as shown by the in vitro displacement of [3H] CGS19755 (IC50 = 107 +/- 7 nM).
 No appreciable affinity in [3H]alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) or [3H]kainate binding assays was observed (IC50 values greater than 10,000 nM).
 In vitro NMDA receptor antagonist activity was further demonstrated by selective inhibition of NMDA-induced depolarization in cortical wedges (IC50 = 4.2 +/- 0.4 microM vs.
 40 microM NMDA).
 LY233053 was effective after in vivo systemic administration in a number of animal models.
 In neonatal rats, LY233053 selectively blocked NMDA-induced convulsions (ED50 = 14.5 mg/kg i.p.) with a relatively short duration of action (2-4 hr).
 In pigeons, LY233053 potently antagonized (ED50 = 1.3 mg/kg i.m.) the behavioral suppressant effects of 10 mg/kg of NMDA.
 However, a dose of 160 mg/kg, i.m., was required to produce phencyclidine-like catalepsy in pigeons.
 In mice, LY233053 protected against maximal electroshock-induced seizures at lower doses (ED50 = 19.9 mg/kg i.p.) than those that impaired horizontal screen performance (ED50 = 40.9 mg/kg i.p.).
 Cholinergic and GABAergic neuronal degenerations after striatal infusion of NMDA were prevented by single or multiple i.p.
 doses of LY233053.
 In summary, the antagonist activity of LY233053 after systemic administration demonstrates potential therapeutic value in conditions of neuronal cell loss due to NMDA receptor excitotoxicity.
 The relatively short duration of action of LY233053 may make this compound particularly advantageous as a neuroprotective agent in the treatment of acute conditions such as cerebral ischemia.

 Recent experimental studies show that the opioid system is important to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular impairment in congestive heart failure.
 Plasma beta-endorphin levels were measured in 37 patients with congestive heart failure and compared with those of 21 age- and gender-matched normal subjects.
 The relation of plasma beta-endorphin levels and cardiac function at rest and exercise capacity was assessed in 17 of the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
 Exercise capacity was determined by symptom-limited maximal treadmill exercise with expired gas analysis.
 Plasma beta-endorphin levels were elevated and correlated with the patients' New York Heart Association functional cardiac status (control: 14.0 +/- 4.4 pg/ml; class II: 17.9 +/- 3.6 pg/ml; class III: 28.3 +/- 8.8 pg/ml; class IV: 46.7 +/- 14.6 pg/ml, mean +/- SD).
 No relation was found between plasma beta-endorphin levels and left ventricular systolic performance as assessed by M-mode and Doppler echocardiography.
 Plasma beta-endorphin levels were negatively correlated with cardiac output determined by Doppler echocardiography and positively correlated with systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.733, r = 0.747, respectively, both p less than 0.001), but not correlated with calf blood flow as measured by a plethysmography.
 A good correlation was found between plasma beta-endorphin levels at rest and exercise capacity.
 The correlations with peak oxygen consumption, anaerobic threshold, and peak rate-pressure product were r = -0.721, -0.672, and -0.674, respectively (p less than 0.01).
 The data show that plasma beta-endorphin levels are elevated in patients with congestive heart failure and reflect, to some degree, the severity of the disease.

 Sites in the head and neck region (orbit, nasopharynx, nasal cavity, etc.) are among the most frequent locations for juvenile (embryonal and alveolar) rhabdomyosarcomas in patients younger than 15 years; however, comparable neoplasms in adults are very uncommon.
 A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 12 juvenile rhabdomyosarcomas in patients between the ages of 18 and 36 years is presented.
 There was a female:male ratio of 2:1.
 The orbit with or without contiguous paranasal sinus involvement, nasal cavity, sphenoid sinus, middle ear, and soft tissues of the neck and preauricular region were the primary sites.
 Seven tumors involved a parameningeal site and eight cases were alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas which together contributed to the adverse outcome.
 Only two patients were long-term, disease-free survivors.
 Six patients have died of tumor and two others are alive with persistent disease.
 Immunohistochemical study in 11 cases demonstrated reactivity for vimentin and muscle-specific actin (HHF-35) and desmin in ten cases.

 Final diagnosis of the 78 resected ampullary tumors was adenoma in five cases, carcinoma in 27 cases, and both adenoma and carcinoma in 46 cases.
 Biopsy accuracy of carcinoma (group 4 or 5) was 70% (51 of 73) overall in 73 carcinoma cases.
 Biopsy accuracy was 50% (7 of 14) in the intramural protruding type, 64% (21 of 33) in the exposed protruding type, and 88% (23 of 26) in the ulcerating type.
 The diagnostic accuracy of adenoma (group 3) was 80% (4 of 5) in five cases of ampullary adenoma.
 In 18 (25%) of the 73 carcinoma cases, biopsy diagnosis was adenoma (group 3), whereas carcinoma was found in the deeper layers of surgically resected specimens.
 Biopsy diagnosis of adenoma does not rule out the possibility of deeper carcinoma in ampullary tumors.

951,"Developments in 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor pharmacology in migraine.
 Because a satisfactory animal model for migraine does not exist, attempts to determine a common mechanism of action for effective antimigraine agents may be of benefit in elucidating the pathogenesis of this neurologic syndrome.
 The present review demonstrates that the clinical data that has developed over the past 30 years may allow for the elucidation of the role of specific 5-HT receptor subtypes in the pathophysiology of migraine.
 A large number of both acute and prophylactic antimigraine agents share an ability to interact with 5-HT receptor subtypes in human brain.
 As summarized in Table 3, acute antimigraine drugs (e.g., ergots, sumatriptan) share high affinity for 5-HTID receptors and somewhat lower affinity for 5-HT1A receptors.
 These receptors are present in certain intracranial blood vessels.
 5-HT1D receptors are also located on nerve terminals where they act to inhibit the release of 5-HT and other neurotransmitters.
 Theoretically, 5-HTID receptor agonists may acutely inhibit the release of vasoactive or pain-inducing substances in the perivascular space.
 Conceivably, drugs acting at this receptor would stop the progression of this perivascular process.
 In addition, a number of prophylactic antimigraine drugs display a relatively high affinity for both 5-HT2 and 5-HT1C receptors in human brain.
 Although these receptors are also found in certain blood vessels, they are present throughout the nervous system.
 The receptors appear to mediate neuronal depolarizations at the cellular level.
 Moreover, the 5-HT2 receptor appears to play a key role in the development of inflammation in certain smooth muscle systems.
 Theoretically, the ability of 5-HT2 antagonists to protect perivascular inflammation may account for their efficacy in the prophylactic treatment of migraine.
 These data offer a novel approach to the analysis of antimigraine agents.
 Drugs could be selected for use in clinical migraine studies based on their selectivity for a specific 5-HT receptor subtype.
 For example, an agent that displays both high affinity and selectivity for 5-HT1D receptors could be clinically evaluated.
 Its effectiveness, or lack thereof, would indicate the importance of this specific 5-HT receptor site in the pathogenesis of migraine.
 Future attempts to determine a common mechanism of action for effective antimigraine agents should facilitate the elucidation of the pathogenesis of this neurologic syndrome.

 We designed an ex vivo bone marrow treatment for breast cancer patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support (ABMS), using 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC), an active derivative of cyclophosphamide with known activity against breast cancer.
 This phase I bone marrow purging trial used ficoll-separated mononuclear cells (MNC) (devoid of granulocytes and RBCs), as opposed to the buffy coat.
 Twenty-five patients with metastatic breast cancer were studied.
 Patients received three cycles of the Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), fluorouracil, and methotrexate (Duke AFM) regimen, followed by marrow harvest.
 An MNC fraction of marrow was prepared and treated with 4-HC in concentrations of 20 micrograms/mL (four patients), 40 micrograms/mL (four patients), 60 micrograms/mL (nine patients), or 80 micrograms/mL (eight patients) and cryopreserved.
 Patients then received high-dose systemic cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine, followed by infusion of the purged marrow.
 The study end point was marrow engraftment, defined as WBC count greater than 1,000 cells per microliter.
 At the first three dose levels (20, 40, and 60 micrograms/mL 4-HC), there was no significant delay in time to engraftment (19, 20, and 23 days, respectively) compared with the unpurged historical controls (17 days).
 At 80 micrograms/mL, engraftment was significantly delayed compared with the lower concentrations (P = .027), and further escalation of 4-HC was not attempted.
 A significant correlation was observed between the time of leukocyte engraftment and the 4-HC concentration (P = .017).
 With a methylcellulose-based tissue culture assay, we demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) content in the purged marrow and the days to engraftment.

 Control and exposed rats were examined between 2 and 36 wk after exposure.
 Lavaged cells were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage with phosphate-buffered saline.
 Lung wall cells were prepared via collagenase digestion of lung tissue slices.
 Cells from lavage and lung wall were separated by Percoll density centrifugation.
 The three upper fractions, containing mostly macrophages, were cultured, and the conditioned medium was assayed for effect on lung fibroblast growth and for activity of the lysosomal enzyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase.
 Results demonstrated that the cells separated from the lung walls exhibited different reaction patterns compared with those cells recovered by lavage.
 The lung wall cells exhibited a progressive increase in the number of macrophages and lymphocytes compared with a steady state in cells of the lung lavage.
 This increase in macrophages apparently was due to low density cells, which showed features of silica exposure.
 Secretion of a fibroblast-stimulating factor was consistently high by lung wall macrophages, whereas lung lavage macrophages showed inconsistent variations.
 The secretion of NAG was increased in lung lavage macrophages, but decreased at most observation times in lung wall macrophages.

 Although gemistocytic astrocytomas are considered slow-growing astrocytomas, they often behave aggressively.
 To clarify the biological and clinical behavior of these rare tumors, the authors retrospectively identified 59 patients with gemistocytic astrocytoma whose tumors were diagnosed and treated between June, 1976, and July, 1989.
 Three patients who were lost to follow-up review were excluded, as were two whose original slides could not be obtained and three whose tumors were diagnosed at recurrence or at autopsy.
 The pathological material of the remaining 51 patients was reviewed using two sets of histological criteria.
 Thirteen patients (Group A) had ""pure"" gemistocytic astrocytoma, defined as a glial tumor with more than 60% gemistocytes/high-power field and a background of fibrillary astrocytes.
 Fifteen patients (Group B) had ""mixed"" gemistocytic astrocytoma, defined as a glial tumor with 20% to 60% gemistocytes/high-power field and a background of anaplastic astrocytes.
 Twenty-three tumors did not meet these criteria and were excluded from analysis.
 The median age of the patients was 48.5 years in Group A and 38.3 years in Group B (p less than 0.05).
 In both groups, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale score was greater than 90%.
 All patients underwent surgical procedures (four total and 19 partial resections, and five biopsies) and postoperative radiation therapy.
 The majority also had interstitial brachytherapy, chemotherapy, or both.
 Ten patients had one reoperation for tumor recurrence and one had two reoperations; other treatments for recurrence included brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and repeat irradiation.
 All four patients who originally underwent gross total resection are still alive; all five who had a biopsy have died.
 There was no significant difference in median survival times between groups: 136.5 weeks in Group A (range 10 to 310+ weeks) and 135.6 weeks in Group B (range 31 to 460+ weeks).
 Analysis of all 28 patients showed a better prognosis for patients less than 50 years of age (185 vs.
 36 weeks survival time; p less than 0.001), patients with preoperative symptoms lasting for more than 6 months (228.1 vs.
 110.2 weeks survival time; p less than 0.05), and patients with seizures as the first symptom (185.7 vs.
 80 weeks survival time; p less than 0.01).
 Survival time did not correlate with the presence of perivascular lymphocytic infiltration.
 The authors conclude that the presence of at least 20% gemistocytes in a glial neoplasm is a poor prognostic sign, irrespective of the pathological background.
 It is proposed that gemistocytic astrocytomas be classified with anaplastic astrocytomas and treated accordingly.

 The authors report the preliminary results of 14 patients with localized, mobile, resectable rectal cancer treated with local excision and postoperative radiation therapy (RT).
 All had negative surgical resection margins and two received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
 The median follow-up was 29 months (4-43 months).
 The 3-year actuarial survival was 88%.
 The incidence of local failure was 7% (only site of failure) and 21% (component of failure).
 The incidence of local failure increased with T stage (T1, 0/3 [0%]; T2, 1/7 [14%]; and T3, 2/4 [50%]) and tumor size (greater than 3 cm, 33%, versus less than or equal to 3 cm, 0%).
 Three patients developed local failure at 6, 15, and 21 months.
 Three underwent a salvage abdominoperineal resection and were locally controlled at 2 and 28 months following salvage surgery.
 One patient underwent an abdominoperineal resection for a clinically presumed local failure; however, no tumor was found in the specimen.
 Therefore, the 13 patients who either were initially locally controlled or underwent salvage or nonsalvage surgery had no evidence of disease in the pelvis at the time of last follow-up.
 Local excision and postoperative RT may be an alternative to standard surgery in selected cases.
 However, additional follow-up and more experience are needed in order to determine if this approach will ultimately have local control and survival rates similar to those of a low anterior resection or an abdominoperineal resection.

 Myocardial sulfhydryl (SH)-containing compounds, including reduced glutathione (GSH), are both defenses against and potential markers of reactive oxygen metabolite injury during ischemia and reperfusion.
 We examined the alterations in GSH and other myocardial SH pools during reperfusion in anesthetized dogs exposed to brief (15 minutes, n = 7) or prolonged (90 minutes, n = 6) regional ischemia caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.
 Ninety minutes of ischemia followed by 5 hours of reperfusion, which resulted in myocardial necrosis of 43.9 +/- 4.0% of the area at risk, caused a 22% reduction in total myocardial SH groups (p less than 0.01), a 57% decrease in nonprotein myocardial SH groups (p less than 0.01), a 56% decrease in GSH (p less than 0.01), and a 62% decrease in non-GSH, nonprotein SH groups (p less than 0.02).
 However, protein SH groups were not significantly reduced (12% decrease, p = NS).
 Also, myocardial release of GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) into the coronary venous effluent occurred during early reperfusion.
 In contrast, 15 minutes of ischemia, followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, did not alter myocardial total SH groups, protein SH groups, or GSH (9% decrease, p = NS); nor was there reperfusion release of GSH or GSSG.
 However, even with brief ischemia, nonprotein SH groups decreased 23% (p less than 0.05), due mainly to a 59% decrease in the non-GSH, nonprotein SH pool (p less than 0.05).
 These changes after brief ischemia occurred without alterations in myocardial GSSG or the GSH/GSSG ratio.

 There were two U-74006F-treated groups, receiving doses of 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg, and a placebo-treated group.
 Each monkey underwent baseline cerebral angiography followed by right-sided craniectomy and placement of subarachnoid clot around the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
 Treatment was administered intravenously every 8 hours for 6 days.
 Seven days after the experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), angiography was repeated and the animals were killed.
 In the placebo-treated group, significant vasospasm occurred in the MCA on the side of the clot (p less than 0.01).
 After U-74006F treatment at both dosages, significantly less vasospasm developed in the clot-side MCA (p less than 0.01).
 The content of malondialdehyde was measured by both the thiobarbituric acid test and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
 Comparing the two methods, HPLC proved to be more accurate than the thiobarbituric acid test, especially for measurement of low concentrations of malondialdehyde.
 In the placebo-treated group, the malondialdehyde content was significantly increased in the Day 7 clot (p less than 0.05).
 In contrast, malondialdehyde content in freshly prepared clot was very low.
 In the 0.3-mg/kg U-74006F group, the malondialdehyde content of clot was significantly less at Day 7 compared to clot from the placebo-treated group (p less than 0.05).
 Although the malondialdehyde content of clot from the 1.0 mg/kg U-74006F-treated group was less than that of placebo, it was not significantly so.
 Malondialdehyde was not detected in the actual vessel wall of the MCA of any group.
 These results suggest that lipid peroxidation in subarachnoid clot may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm and that the salutary effects of U-74006F in vasospasm may be mediated by a reduction of lipid peroxidation in SAH.

963,"The no-scalpel vasectomy.
 A refined method of delivering the vas deferens for vasectomy has been developed and used in China since 1974.
 This method eliminates the scalpel, results in fewer hematomas and infections, and leaves a smaller wound than conventional techniques.
 An extracutaneous fixation ring clamp encircles and firmly secures the vas without penetrating the skin.
 A sharp curved hemostat punctures and dilates the scrotal skin and vas sheath.
 The vas is delivered, cleaned and occluded by the surgeon's preferred technique.
 The contralateral vas is delivered through the same opening.
 The puncture wound contracts to about 2 mm., is not visible to the man and requires no sutures for closure.
 The reported incidence of hematoma in 179,741 men followed in China was 0.09%.
 No hematomas or infections were identified in the first 273 procedures performed by a surgeon in the United States.
 The operating time in China and for the last 50 United States procedures has ranged from 5 to 11 minutes.
 The disadvantage of the technique is the hand-on training and number of cases necessary to gain proficiency.
 However, the advantages for surgeons and patients should enhance the popularity of vasectomy.

 The systemic blood flow to the airways of the left lung was determined by the radioactive microsphere technique before and 17 h after smoke inhalation in six conscious sheep (smoke group) and six sheep insufflated with air alone (sham group).
 Smoke inhalation caused a sixfold increase in systemic blood flow to the lower trachea (baseline 10.6 +/- 1.7 vs.
 injury 60.9 +/- 16.1 ml.min-1.100 g-1) and an 11- to 14-fold increase to the intrapulmonary central airways (baseline range 9.5 +/- 1.9 to 13.5 +/- 3.7 ml.min-1.100 g-1 vs.

 There was a trend for this hyperemic response to be greater as airway diameter decreased from the trachea to 2-mm-diam central airways.
 In airways smaller than 2 mm, the hyperemic response appeared to diminish.
 The total systemic blood flow to whole lung is predominantly to small peripheral airways and showed no significant increase from its baseline level of 17.5 +/- 3.7 ml.min-1.100 g-1 in the lung homogenate.

 The standard suitability criteria for ablation were adhered to except that patients were treated at their first visit when the colposcopist expected that the diagnosis would be no worse than CIN 3.
 Overall 97% of the women were treated at their first visit.
 In 30 women (2%) the histology was glandular or worse than expected, but 22 of these showed no persistent cervical disease subsequently.
 Follow-up was achieved for 87% at 10 years.
 In actuarial terms the primary success rate was 95% at 1 year and 92% at 5 years, it was similar for all age groups.

 Preliminary data using B72.3 murine monoclonal antibody labeled with iodine 125 suggested that both clinically apparent as well as occult sites of colorectal cancer could be identified intraoperatively using a hand-held gamma detecting probe.
 We report the preliminary data of a multicenter trial of this approach in patients with primary or recurrent colorectal cancer.
 One hundred four patients with primary, suspected, or known recurrent colorectal cancer received an intravenous infusion of 1 mg of B72.3 monoclonal antibody radiolabeled with 7.4 x 10 Bq of iodine 125.
 Twenty-six patients with primary colorectal cancer and 72 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer were examined.
 Using the gamma detecting probe, 78% of the patients had localization of the antibody in their tumor; this included 75% of primary tumor sites and 63% of all recurrent tumor sites; 9.2% of all tumor sites identified represented occult sites detected only with the gamma detecting probe.
 The overall sensitivity was 77% and a predictive value of a positive detection was 78%.
 A total of 30 occult sites in 26 patients were identified.
 In patients with recurrent cancer, the antibody study provided unique data that precluded resection in 10 patients, and in another eight patients it extended the potentially curative procedure.

 Pacemaker migration can interfere with correct pacing system function and patient comfort.
 A Dacron pouch has been developed which may prevent these problems.
 To assess the efficacy of the pouch, we measured various factors of pacemaker mobility in 100 patients after long-term follow-up.
 The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of their dictated operative reports: group 1, no pouch or anchoring stitch; group 2, pouch only; group 3, anchoring stitch to pacemaker header or pouch.
 The average age of the study population was 74.3 +/- 11 years.
 Total follow-up time was 42 +/- 28 months (group I, 53 +/- 32 months; group 2, 36 +/- 23 months; group 3, 34 +/- 25 months).
 There were no significant differences when pacemakers were measured for movement in the inferosuperior and lateromedial directions, nor was there any difference in the distance between the incision scar and the pacemaker header in any group.
 There was a significant difference between group 1 and groups 2 and 3 when the degree of tilt of the pacemaker off the chest wall was compared.
 This was 46 degrees +/- 34 degrees for group 1 and 27 degrees +/- 26 degrees and 26 degrees +/- 27 degrees for groups 2 and 3, respectively (p less than 0.02 for both).
 These data suggest that the Dacron pouch does not restrict pacemaker mobility parallel to the chest wall during long-term follow-up but does reduce the angle to which the pacemaker can be tilted relative to the chest wall.

970,"A new method of haemodynamic assessment of mitral stenosis in atrial fibrillation: construction of a nomogram.
 Accurate haemodynamic assessment of mitral stenosis by hydraulic formulas requires measurement of the mean valve gradient and the cardiac output.
 The calculation is laborious, particularly in the presence of atrial fibrillation when averaged values obtained from multiple beat-to-beat determinations must be used.
 The relations between valve area, end diastolic gradient, and heart rate in 20 patients with mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation were examined.
 In each patient the end diastolic pressure gradient for each cardiac cycle was related linearly to the RR interval of that cycle, and this relation was unchanged on exercise.
 The slope (S) and intercept (I) of this relation correlated with the degree of mitral stenosis as measured by the Gorlin valve area.
 The regression equations describing these relations were then used to construct a nomogram relating end diastolic pressure gradient to mitral valve area at different heart rates.
 When the nomogram was applied to catheterisation data from a further 30 patients the results correlated well with direct calculation of valve area by the Gorlin formula.
 The nomogram is simple to use, does not require measurement of cardiac output, and is independent of heart rate so that it is unnecessary for the patient to exercise during catheterisation.

 In the present study, responses of long-term human coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs) to known endothelium-dependent vasodilators, acetylcholine, calcium ionophore A23187, thrombin, and histamine, as well as authentic nitric oxide, the putative endothelium-derived relaxing factor, were studied.
 Sixteen CAGBs were isolated within 1-2 hours from hearts of 14 patients receiving a cardiac transplant.
 A total of 109 ring segments were prepared from these CABGs and studied in vitro.
 The duration of the CABGs ranged from 7 months to 12 years.
 Addition of acetylcholine (0.01-10 microM), calcium ionophore A23187 (0.01-1.0 microM), thrombin (0.01-1.0 unit/ml), and histamine (0.01-1.0 microM) consistently produced a dose- and endothelium-dependent relaxation, reaching a maximum of -35.3 +/- 3.3%, -45.3 +/- 5.5%, -26.9 +/- 4.8%, and -17.8 +/- 2.5% (mean +/- SEM), respectively.
 No significant difference was observed among the CABGs with different duration of transplantation, whereas the relaxant responses of different segments along the entire length of a CABG were markedly different.
 These latter differences in the endothelium-dependent responses appear to correlate inversely with the development of intimal proliferative lesions in these CABGs.
 Addition of nitric oxide (0.01-10 microM) produced a potent dose- and endothelium-independent relaxation, which was also slightly depressed in CABGs with severe intimal proliferation.
 These results demonstrate that long-term transplanted human saphenous vein grafts retain their endothelium-dependent responses and that development of severe intimal proliferative lesions, rather than the duration of the grafts, result in marked alterations in the reactivity of these transplanted CABGs.

 We investigated the impact of the atrial communication on the mitral valve area calculation after percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy in 17 patients (15 women, 2 men; mean age 56 +/- 4 years).
 The hemodynamic measurements and mitral valve area calculations were performed with and without balloon occlusion of the atrial septal puncture site.
 The mitral valve area determined with balloon occlusion was significantly smaller than the mitral valve area determined without occlusion (1.6 +/- 0.1 vs.
 1.9 +/- 0.1 cm2, P less than 0.01), and was similar to the echocardiographically determined valve area (1.6 +/- 0.1 cm2).
 This decrease in the calculated mitral valve area with occlusion was associated with a decrease in the measured cardiac output, without a change in the mitral valve gradient or the diastolic filling period.
 Occlusion of the atrial septal puncture site may permit more accurate determination of the mitral valve area and thus provide a better reference point for future comparison should the question or restenosis arise.

973,"The transcriptional transactivator of human foamy virus maps to the bel 1 genomic region.
 The human foamy virus (HFV) genome possesses three open reading frames (bel 1, 2, and 3) located between env and the 3' long terminal repeat.
 By analogy to other human retroviruses this region was selected as the most likely candidate to encode the viral transactivator.
 Results presented here confirmed this and showed further that a deletion introduced only into the bel 1 open reading frame of a plasmid derived from an infectious molecular clone of HFV abolished transactivation.
 In contrast, deletions in bel 2 and bel 3 had only minor effects on the ability to transactivate.
 The role of the bel 1 genomic region as a transactivator was further investigated by eukaryotic expression of a genome fragment of HFV spanning the bel 1 open reading frame.
 A construct expressing bel 1 under control of a heterologous promoter was found to transactivate the HFV long terminal repeat in a dose-dependent fashion.
 Furthermore, it is shown that the U3 region of the HFV long terminal repeat is sufficient to respond to the HFV transactivator.

 OBJECTIVE--To determine whether there is sufficient benefit to be gained by offering screening for breast cancer with mammography to women aged 65-79, who are not normally invited for screening.
 DESIGN--Pilot study of women eligible for screening but not for personal invitation.
 The results of this study were compared with the results of routinely screened younger women (aged 50-64) from the same general practice.
 SETTING--One group general practice in south Manchester.
 PATIENTS--The 631 women aged 65-79 on the practice list.
 A total of 42 (7%) were excluded by the general practitioner, and 22 (4%) invitation letters were returned by the post office.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response rates to invitation for screening assessed by three indices: crude population coverage ratio, crude invited population coverage ratio, and corrected invited population coverage ratio.
 RESULTS--344 Patients aged 65-79 (61% of those invited, excluding those who could not be traced) were screened compared with 77% of women aged 50-64.
 The three response indices were higher for younger women than older: crude population coverage ratio = 66.5%, crude invited population coverage ratio = 69.3%, corrected invited population coverage ratio = 76.8% for women aged 50-64, compared with 54.5%, 58.4%, and 60.7% respectively for women aged 65-79.
 All four biopsies done in the older women gave positive results, giving a cancer detection rate of 11.6/1000 compared with 4.1/1000 among younger women.
 CONCLUSIONS--These results show that there is a potential for high attendance at routine screening by older women if they are invited in the same way as younger women.
 If these results are found elsewhere the costs and benefits of screening older women should be reassessed.

 OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to evaluate the utility of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation assays in clinical research in psychoimmunology.
 METHOD: They examined 23 depressed patients and 23 matched comparison subjects with this assay.
 There were no significant differences between these groups.
 They then combined the results of this study with the results of their previous study of 20 depressed patients and 20 comparison subjects to examine possible determinants of lymphocyte proliferation in depression.
 RESULTS: Depressed patients with lower proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects had lower depression subscale, anergia subscale, and total scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale than did patients with higher proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects.
 This finding was unexpected and unexplained.
 Depressed patients with lower proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects also had fewer obsessions and compulsions and less psychomotor agitation according to the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia interview than did patients with higher proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects.
 Stepwise discriminant analysis and cluster analysis contributed little further understanding of the determinants of in vitro lymphocyte proliferation of cells from depressed patients.
 CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal studies using multiple serial determinations of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation are the minimal design needed to make this assay useful in further evaluating any immune system changes in depression.

 The proportion of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) who are considered demented ranges from 10% to 15%.
 Because dementia may affect survival in PD, the incidence rate of dementia, rather than proportion, would be a more accurate measure of disease frequency.
 We previously estimated the proportion of patients with PD and dementia to be 10.9% from the records of a cohort with the idiopathic form of PD in a major medical center.
 We reviewed the clinical records of this cohort after 4 years and 9 months to estimate the incidence rate of dementia.
 We identified 65 new cases of dementia from the 249 patient-records available.
 Using the number of person-years of follow-up for each case as the denominator, we estimated the overall incidence rate to be 69 per 1,000 person-years of observation.
 The mean age of this cohort was 71.4 years.
 The cumulative incidence of dementia increased with age.
 By 85 years of age, over 65% of the surviving members of the cohort were demented.
 The age-specific incidence rates for dementia in this cohort of PD were significantly greater than for a similarly aged cohort of healthy elderly people.
 The age-specific standard morbidity ratios indicated that, compared with people of similar ages, patients with PD have the highest increase in risk for dementia between ages 65 and 75.

 Among 440 adult patients with tibial shaft fracture and accompanying fibular fracture there were eight cases with radiographically ununited fibulae 4 months after the injury, each with uneventful tibial union.
 Fractures with severe soft-tissue injuries were excluded from this study.
 In 293 patients the treatment method of the tibial fracture was conservative, comprising closed reduction and immobilization by long plaster cast.
 In 147 patients it was intramedullary Kuntscher nailing, and all the eight cases with delayed fibular union occurred among these, the frequency being 5.4%.
 The typical accompanying fibular fracture to develop delayed union was a comminuted one in the middle or distal third of the bone.
 At a followup examination 5 to 8 years after the original injury four of the eight fractures were found to have ultimately spontaneously united, while three showed a radiographically indisputable nonunion.
 One patient had undergone segmental fibular ostectomy because of persistent local pain but in the remaining patients the subjective symptoms were negligible.
 The occurrence of delayed fibular union in association with rigid intramedullary nailing of concomitant tibial shaft fracture is a phenomenon of which trauma surgeons should be aware even if the natural course of the condition often seems to be benign.

 The analysis of neuropsychological disorders of lexical processing has provided important clues about the general organization of the lexical system and the internal structure of the processing components.
 Reports of patients with selective dysfunction of specific semantic categories such as abstract versus concrete words, living things versus inanimate objects, animals, fruits and vegetables, proper names and so forth, support the hypothesis that the neural organization of the semantic processing component is organized in these categories.
 There are reports of selective dysfunction of the grammatical categories noun and verb, suggesting that a dimension of lexical organization is the grammatical class of words.
 But the results reported in these studies have not provided unambiguous evidence concerning two fundamental questions about the nature and the locus of this organization within the lexical system.
 Is the noun-verb distinction represented in the semantic or in the phonological and orthographic lexicons? Is grammatical-class knowledge represented independently of lexical forms or is it represented separately and redundantly within each modality-specific lexicon? Here we report the performance of two brain-damaged subjects with modality-specific deficits restricted principally (H.W.) or virtually only (S.J.D) to verbs in oral and written production, respectively.
 The contrasting performance suggests that grammatical-class distinctions are redundantly represented in the phonological and orthographic output lexical components.

 About one-half of cervical cancer patients whose tumors recur after radical surgery have negative lymph nodes and clear resection margins.
 We evaluated 95 patients with squamous cell tumors who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy between January 1975 and December 1985 and who were thought to be at low risk for recurrence to see whether other clinical or histopathologic factors were predictive of tumor recurrence.
 Detailed retrospective record review and complete pathology review were accomplished for each case.
 The 5-year actuarial survival rate was 89%.
 Nine patients developed recurrent disease (9.5%), of whom eight died.
 Several clinical features were evaluated as possible prognostic factors: patient age (P = .26), patient race (P = .60), cervical diameter (P = .24), extent of gross cervical involvement (P = .36), and presence of contact bleeding (P = .82).
 Histopathologic features were examined: depth of invasion (P = .31), number of mitoses (P = .42), character of the tumor-stromal border (P = .15), histologic differentiation (P = .02), lymph-vascular space invasion (P = .56), and width of tumor (P = .23).
 Depth of invasion did correlate with increasing tumor width (P less than .001).
 Once node- and margin-positive patients are excluded, differentiation may be the only feature useful in identifying patients at risk for recurrence.
 Because almost one-half of our patients had poorly differentiated tumors, sole use of this feature as a criterion for adjuvant therapy would have resulted in overtreatment of low-risk patients.

985,"Dietary salt and blood pressure. A perspective.
 Although dietary salt restriction is often valuable as sole or adjunctive therapy of hypertensive disorders, it is abundantly clear that hypertensive patients comprise a heterogeneous group with regard to salt sensitivity of blood pressure.
 This is apparent despite the many methodological obstacles to defining salt sensitivity in an individual patient.
 Currently, dietary trial is the only sure means of defining a given patient as responsive to salt restriction.
 Easily definable markers of salt sensitivity would allow appropriate targeting of this rather ponderous therapy.
 Promising leads include the assessment of membrane ion transporters such as sodium-lithium exchange and of the activity of the renin-angiotensin system, including the phenomenon of ""non-modulating"" hypertension and other volume regulatory hormones such as atrial natriuretic factor.
 Although less intensively studied than in hypertensive patients, the blood pressure response of normal subjects to salt restriction is also marked by great variability.
 Given the possibility of deleterious consequences of population-wide salt restriction for at least some people in a setting such as the United States, it seems imprudent to recommend such a policy before its proven worth has been demonstrated by clinical trial.
 Pending such evidence and the development of markers, salt restriction should be reserved for those in whom it is of demonstrated efficacy.

 Tumor surveillance tests are used to determine whether malignant cells are responsive or resistant to therapeutic regimens.
 For patients with neuroblastoma, conventional methods of surveillance are not sensitive enough.
 Because tumor cells are shed into the circulation, immunocytologic analysis of blood may function as a sensitive monitoring system.
 In this study, five blood samples were obtained from two patients with disseminated neuroblastoma at diagnosis and during therapy.
 These samples were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies and immunoperoxidase staining to determine whether circulating neuroblasts were present.
 In both patients, the presence or absence of circulating neuroblasts yielded information that was more sensitive than that from conventional tests.
 The authors conclude that immunocytologic analysis of blood should be included with conventional monitoring methods for surveillance of patients with disseminated neuroblastoma.

 To find out whether measurements of height made by health visitors are sufficiently accurate for use in routine screening of children we carried out an interobserver and intraobserver reliability study.
 Height measurements were made on a group of 10 children aged 3 years old and 10 aged 4.5 years old by two sets of four health visitors.
 They used a Microtoise or wall chart and the measurements were compared with those made by a trained auxologist with a Harpenden stadiometer.
 For a single assessment of height both pieces of equipment gave reasonably accurate results.
 In a child aged 3 years, with height measured on the Microtoise as 100 cm, the true height could be expected--with 95% probability--to lie between 99.2 cm-101.8 cm.
 At the age of 4.5 years, if the measurement was 110 cm, the child's true height could be expected to lie between 108.9 cm and 111.9 cm.
 The narrowest confidence interval for the growth rate from 3 to 4.5 years was achieved with the Microtoise, taking the mean of three measurements.
 We conclude that measurements made by health visitors are sufficiently accurate for routine screening of height, and the use of such measurements for the calculation of height velocity could be improved by more structured training.

 Photodynamic therapy, which consists of the selective destruction of tumors using a combination of a photosensitizer administered systemically (dihematoporphyrin ether) and an argon dye-pumped laser, has provoked profound interest amongst oncologists and has particularly titillated head and neck oncologists with its potential.
 Unfortunately, no multi-institutional trials for head and neck tumors have been introduced, and the literature is replete with anecdotal reports from individual researchers on the management of advanced cancers for palliation, superficial early cancers, and field cancerization of the mucosa (""condemned mucosa"").
 A personal 5-year experience with 41 head and neck cancers was reviewed, as was the current literature.
 An attempt was made to place in perspective the true role and future direction of this technology.

990,"Lipoprotein-related coronary risk factors in patients with angiographically defined coronary artery disease: relation to number of stenosed arteries.
 To determine whether an index estimating antagonism between low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) would improve separation between groups with and without coronary artherosclerosis, patients undergoing coronary catheterization (35 women and 99 men) were analysed for total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol (HDLc), apolipoprotein A (apo A) and apolipoprotein B (apo B).
 The subjects were categorized as groups 0, 1, 2 or 3 according to the number of stenosed arteries (greater than 75% areal stenosis).
 Thirty of the patients showed no significant coronary atherosclerosis (group 0).
 Serum apo B and TC concentrations were directly related to the number of stenosed vessels, whereas the concentrations of apo A and HDLc were negatively correlated with the number of stenosed arteries.
 An 'atherogenic Index' (ATH index) calculated as the product of serum concentrations of apo B, and TC minus HDLc divided by the product of apo A and HDLc, proved more satisfactory than individual lipoprotein components for discrimination between subjects with and without stenosis.
 Accordingly, identification of coronary groups may be improved by using the ATH index.

991,"Alternating hepatic intra-arterial floxuridine and fluorouracil: a less toxic regimen for treatment of liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
 Hepatic intra-arterial (HIA) infusion of floxuridine (FUDR) via an implanted pump has shown promise in the treatment of colorectal cancer metastasized to the liver.
 However, the potential benefit of this therapy may be offset by the high incidence of treatment-limiting biliary toxicity.
 Although weekly HIA bolus of fluorouracil (5-FU) is effective against metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver with no biliary toxicity, it is limited by systemic side effects.
 In December 1986, we began a phase II trial of alternating HIA FUDR and 5-FU via the implanted pump in an attempt to extend the duration of treatment by obviating the limiting biliary (FUDR) and systemic (5-FU) drug toxic effects.
 Patients received continuous HIA FUDR at 0.1 mg/kg of body weight per day on days 1 through 8 followed by an HIA bolus of 5-FU at 15 mg/kg given via the pump sideport on days 15, 22, and 29, with the cycle repeated every 35 days.
 Sixty-eight patients were enrolled in this trial, and 64 were fully evaluable.
 Of the 64 patients, 30 (47%) previously had received chemotherapy.
 Major response (complete response plus partial response) was observed in 32 (50%) of 64 patients, and the median survival from pump implantation in all patients was 22.4 months.
 In contrast to the experience with the single-agent HIA FUDR regimen, no patient had treatment terminated because of drug toxicity.
 Alternating HIA FUDR and 5-FU has efficacy similar to that of HIA FUDR given alone, but when closely monitored and adjusted appropriately, is not associated with toxic effects requiring treatment termination.

992,"The role of the facial nerve latency test in the prognosis of Bell's palsy.
 Eighty patients with idiopathic facial nerve palsy were evaluated by the facial nerve latency test.
 Depending on the latency time, the patients were classified into the following four groups: group A patients had normal latency times (3.25 msec); group B patients had slightly extended latency times (4 to 7 msec) and a mean of 5.6 msec; group C patients had extended latency times (10 to 14 msec) and a mean of 10.2 msec; and group D patients displayed complete disappearance of evoked compound muscle action potential (no responses).
 Under the same therapeutic regimen, it was determined that, when the latency time was normal or close to normal, the functional recovery of the nerve was complete or almost complete, and the recovery time was short.
 When the latency time was extended or there was no response, the functional recovery of the nerve was either incomplete or absent.

 Eighty-nine patients with carcinoma of the head of the pancreas underwent pancreaticoduodenectomies.
 The actuarial 5-year survival for all 89 patients was 19%, with a median survival of 11.9 months.
 The 81 hospital survivors were analyzed in an effort to determine factors influencing long-term survival.
 Negative lymph nodes and the absence of blood vessel invasion both favored long-term survival.
 The strongest predictive factor was negative lymph node status with a median survival of 55.8 months, compared with 11 months with lymph nodes involved with tumor (p less than 0.05).
 Blood transfusions were also predictive, with patients receiving two or fewer units having a median survival of 24.7 months, compared with 10.2 months for those receiving three or more units (p less than 0.05).
 The most important determinant of long-term survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer is biology of the tumor (lymph node status, blood vessel invasion).
 However, performance of the resection (units of blood transfused) also appears to be an important factor influencing survival.

995,"Leukotriene synthesis inhibition and receptor blockade do not inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in sheep.
 Several lines of evidence suggest that leukotrienes may be mediators of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV).
 However, the effect of leukotriene inhibition on HPV remains controversial.
 The present study investigated the effect of leukotriene synthesis inhibition and receptor blockade on HPV in the halothane-anesthetized sheep.
 After initial baseline measurements, the pulmonary pressor response to 15 min of global hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.13) was measured.
 A second set of baseline measurements was obtained and the sheep then received the combined cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor BW755C, the selective lipoxygenase inhibitor U60257, or the leukotriene receptor antagonist LY171883.
 Hemodynamic measurements were obtained after drug administration and during a subsequent hypoxic challenge (FIO2 = 0.13).
 Initial hypoxic challenge increased pulmonary artery pressure 68% and increased pulmonary vascular resistance 104%.
 Pulmonary hemodynamics after recovery from hypoxia were similar to initial baseline values.
 Drug administration had no significant hemodynamic effect.
 Hypoxic challenge after drug administration resulted in a pulmonary pressor response identical to the initial hypoxic challenge.
 Because leukotriene synthesis inhibition and receptor blockade did not alter the response to hypoxia, we conclude that leukotrienes are not obligatory mediators of HPV.
 A critical review of the literature supports a modulatory rather than an obligatory role for leukotrienes in HPV.

 Of 2947 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), treated during three consecutive studies of the Pediatric Oncology Group (1974-1986), 52 (1.8%) had Down's Syndrome (DS).
 Comparison of clinical and laboratory characteristics showed no significant differences in leukocyte count, racial distribution, sex ratio, platelet count, incidence of mediastinal mass, lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, or percentage of blood or bone marrow blasts for children with ALL with or without Down's Syndrome (DS-ALL or NDS-ALL, respectively).
 However, children with DS-ALL were slightly older at the time of presentation and had higher hemoglobin values.
 The relative frequency of each major immunophenotype (early pre-B, pre-B, T, or B) was also comparable for patients with or without DS.
 For this report, treatment regimens were categorized as either conventional (no consolidation therapy) or intensive.
 Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of DS, a higher leukocyte count, black race, or age older than 10 years was independently associated with a poorer event-free survival (EFS) for children treated with conventional chemotherapy.
 However, for the cohort of children who received intensive chemotherapy, DS was no longer an independent risk factor.
 In fact, event-free survival (EFS) was markedly improved to a level comparable with that observed in the children diagnosed as having NDS-ALL.
 On the other hand, serious toxicity, requiring interruption of treatment, was significantly more frequent in the intensively treated children with DS compared with similarly treated patients with NDS-ALL, although deaths resulting from toxicity occurred infrequently.

 The mean age was 5.7 +/- 4.8 years (range 1.1 to 14.8).
 Congestive heart failure was present in all as were ST-T wave changes, cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema on chest roentgenogram.
 Echocardiography demonstrated pericardial effusion in five patients and mitral regurgitation in eight.
 Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 34 +/- 12%.

 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is an insidiously developing, adult-onset, progressive anterior horn cell degeneration with associated degeneration of descending motor pathways.
 It has been recognized as an important clinical syndrome since the middle of the 19th century.
 Despite increasing clinical and research interest in this condition, its cause remains obscure, even in the broadest terms.
 Epidemiologic characteristics of the disease have been interpreted as evidence of both genetic and environmental causes.
 A major change in the view of this disease is the widely developing perception that it is a disease of elderly persons more than of middle-aged adults as was previously taught.
 Etiologic hypotheses encompass a broad range of postulated pathophysiologic mechanisms, and we review these in detail.
 The clinical limits of the disease can now be better defined by using modern diagnostic techniques.
 Although interest in supportive symptomatic therapy is growing, no intervention has yet been shown to modify the biologically determined motor system degeneration.

 The first scan showed decreased 123I-IMP uptake in the right frontal lobe.
 This abnormal image was regarded as the primary focus of his epilepsy on the basis of its regional agreement with focal epileptic discharges on EEGs.
 In the second scan, he showed normal imaging, while the third scan showed the same abnormal image as before, in the right frontal lobe.
 The frequency of his clinical seizures was almost unchanged during the intervals between scans and further EEGs recorded soon after each scan showed almost no changes in the basic activities and frequency of the epileptic discharges.

 Patients with cervical spine fractures or dislocations and those with fixed deformity were excluded.
 The clinical significance of asymmetry was determined utilizing dynamic axial CT scanning of the occiput (C0), atlas (C1) and axis (C2) with the head neutral and with 15 degrees to 30 degrees active rotation.
 Nineteen patients demonstrated greater than 5 degrees of relative motion of C1 on C2 bilaterally.

 Forced expiratory volume in 1 s adjusted for height (FEV1/Ht2) was significantly lower in smokers than nonsmokers and in persons who reported shortness of breath; FEV1/Ht2 was correlated positively with a history of strenuous physical activity, duration of exercise on the treadmill, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
 It was associated negatively with skinfold thicknesses, serum triglycerides, fasting serum insulin, and the Cook Medley scale of hostility.

1010,"Divergent effects of serotonin on coronary-artery dimensions and blood flow in patients with coronary atherosclerosis and control patients 
 BACKGROUND.
 Studies in animals have shown that serotonin constricts coronary arteries if the endothelium is damaged, but in vitro studies have revealed a vasodilating effect on isolated coronary segments with an intact endothelium.
 To investigate the effect of serotonin in humans, we studied coronary-artery cross-sectional area and blood flow before and after the infusion of serotonin in seven patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and in seven with coronary artery disease.
 METHODS.
 We measured the cross-sectional area of the coronary artery by quantitative angiography and coronary blood flow with an intracoronary Doppler catheter.
 Measurements were obtained at base line and during intracoronary infusions of serotonin (0.1, 1, and 10 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per minute, for two minutes).
 We repeated the measurements after an infusion of ketanserin, an antagonist of serotonin receptors that is thought to block the effect of serotonin on receptors in the arterial wall but not in the endothelium.
 RESULTS.
 In patients with normal coronary arteries, the highest dose of serotonin increased cross-sectional area by 52 percent (P less than 0.001) and blood flow by 58 percent (P less than 0.01).
 The effect was significantly potentiated by administration of ketanserin.
 In patients with coronary-artery atherosclerosis, serotonin reduced cross-sectional area by 64 percent (P less than 0.001) and blood flow by 59 percent (P less than 0.001).
 Ketanserin prevented this effect.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Serotonin has a vasodilating effect on normal human coronary arteries; when the endothelium is damaged, as in coronary artery disease, serotonin has a direct, unopposed vasoconstricting effect.
 When considered with other evidence, these data suggest that platelet-derived factors such as serotonin may have a role in certain acute coronary ischemic syndromes.

 To assess the extent of jeopardized myocardium in patients with single vessel coronary artery disease of variable severity and location, quantitative exercise thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography was performed in 158 consecutive patients with angiographically proved single vessel coronary artery disease.
 The extent of abnormal left ventricular perfusion was quantified from computer-generated polar maps of three-dimensional myocardial radioactivity.
 Patients with only a moderate (51% to 69%) stenosis tended to have a small perfusion defect irrespective of the coronary artery involved.
 Whereas a perfusion defect measuring greater than or equal to 10% of the left ventricle was found in 78% of patients with no prior infarction and severe (greater than or equal to 70%) stenosis, this was observed in only 24% of patients with moderate stenosis.
 Perfusion defect size increased with increasing severity of stenosis for the entire group without infarction and for those with left anterior descending, right and circumflex coronary artery stenosis.
 However, the correlation between stenosis severity and perfusion defect size was at best only modest (r = 0.38, p = 0.0001).
 The left anterior descending artery was shown to be the most important of the three coronary arteries for providing left ventricular perfusion.
 Proximal stenosis of this artery produced a perfusion defect approximately twice as large as that found in patients with a proximal right or circumflex artery stenosis.
 However, marked heterogeneity in perfusion defect size existed among all three vessels despite comparable stenosis severity.
 This was most apparent for the left anterior descending coronary artery, where mid vessel stenosis commonly produced a perfusion defect similar in size to that found in proximally stenosed vessels.

1019,"What is the best method for assessing the long-term outcome of surgery for accessory pathways and atrioventricular junctional reentrant tachycardias?
 The success of surgery for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is evaluated by a variety of methods in different hospitals.
 Unfortunately, the predictive values of these methods are not known.
 We therefore compared the various methods in 261 patients undergoing surgery for SVT at Westmead Hospital since 1981.
 Surgical outcome was assessed by early tests during the first week after surgery (serial 12-lead electrocardiograms, telemetric monitoring of the electrocardiogram, and electrophysiological study performed using epicardial wires); later tests at 6 months after surgery (12-lead electrocardiograms and electrophysiological study); and symptomatic review done by telephone interview at a median of 34 months after surgery.
 Early tests were obtained in 97%, later tests were obtained in 76%, and symptomatic review was obtained in 98% of patients.
 All of the examined tests were inaccurate methods of surgical assessment compared with the late electrophysiological study.
 A large proportion of the patients proven to be surgical failures at the late electrophysiological study were not detected by early tests (83%), by later electrocardiograms (66%), or by symptomatic assessment (41%).
 Accurate assessment of surgical outcome requires a late electrophysiological study to permit comparison of surgical techniques.
 Late electrophysiological study also provides accurate information on the current risks and benefits of proposed surgery for communication to patients to enable them to make an informed decision on future treatment.
 Most patients are willing to have a late electrophysiological study and usually benefit from clarification of their true surgical outcome.

 A case control study was conducted to identify the systemic and ocular risk factors for retinal arterial macroaneurysms.
 Forty-three patients with 52 photographically confirmed macroaneurysms were located.
 Forty-three age-matched, race-matched concurrent control patients were also identified.
 The patients with macroaneurysms had decreased visual acuity (p less than 0.0001) and a higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.037), female sex (p = 0.099), and retinal vein occlusions (p = 0.055) than controls.
 In patients with both a macroaneurysm and venous occlusion there was a 12.0 times higher prevalence of macroaneurysms in the area of retina drained by the occluded vein (p less than 0.05).
 Common findings associated with macroaneurysms included retinal haemorrhage (81% of patients), retinal exudate (70%), vitreous haemorrhage (30%), macular involvement (30%), and distal arteriolar narrowing (26%).
 Arteriolar occlusion occurred spontaneously (8%) or after laser photocoagulation (16%).

1021,"Quality assurance indicators and short-term outcome of hysterectomy.
 Fifteen gynecologic quality assurance indicators recently published by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were applied to a previously reported hysterectomy data base.
 Chart reviews were performed for the most recent 257 cases in the data base, representing an 18-month interval.
 The indicators were divided into two groups: those intended to identify morbidity and mortality and those intended to screen for appropriateness of care.
 Rates of actual morbidity and cases that failed to meet published criteria sets for hysterectomy were determined by chart review regardless of the presence of a quality assurance indicator.
 A total of 135 indicators were identified in 114 (44%) of the 257 cases, including 64 patients (25%) with morbidity indicators and 50 (19%) with appropriateness indicators.
 Actual morbidity was correctly identified in all 64 cases in which morbidity indicators were present.
 Three cases with significant morbidity were identified by chart review but not identified by the indicators, yielding positive and negative predictive values of 100 and 98%, respectively, and an overall accuracy of 99% for morbidity indicators.
 By contrast, 14 of the 50 cases in which appropriateness indicators were present actually failed to meet published criteria sets.
 An additional seven cases failing to meet criteria sets were identified by chart review and not identified by the indicators, yielding a positive predictive value of 28%, a negative predictive value of 97%, and an overall accuracy of 83% for appropriateness indicators.

 Type 1 antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency, which is the commonest form of inherited ATIII defect, is characterized by a quantitative reduction in both immunologically and functionally detectable protein.
 This condition is associated with a high incidence of thromboembolic disorder.
 Previous investigations have shown that the ATIII genes in the majority of cases are grossly intact, but the precise underlying molecular defects remain unknown.
 We have investigated the molecular basis of a type 1 ATIII deficiency in an Italian kindred by enzymatic amplification of the ATIII gene sequences in affected family members and direct sequencing of the amplified genomic DNA.
 A novel mutation, the deletion of a single T in the second position of codon 119, was identified in each of the affected individuals.
 The resulting frameshift leads to a premature termination in codon 126, effectively resulting in a null allele.

 In 175 premenopausal breast cancer patients, a history of oral contraceptive (OC) use before 20 years of age was significantly associated with higher tumor cell proliferative activity, as indicated by a higher S-phase fraction (SPF), and a higher fraction of DNA aneuploid tumors, compared with later or never users (P = 0.05 and p = 0.01, respectively).
 The higher SPF among early OC users was apparent in patients with aneuploid tumors but not in patients with euploid tumors.
 Abortions (spontaneous or induced) before the first full-term pregnancy also were associated with a higher SPF compared with other young patients with breast cancer (P = 0.03).
 Adjusting for parity and abortions or OC use, respectively, an early OC use was associated with a 43% higher SPF and early abortions were associated with 49% higher SPF.
 Younger patients had a higher SPF and a higher frequency of aneuploid tumors, but this was found to be because the users of OC had a lower median age at diagnosis.
 Among never users, no significant age relationship was seen for SPF or the frequency of aneuploidy.
 For the DNA analyses there is a selection of patients with breast cancer with larger tumors, and therefore the conclusions drawn in this article may not be generalizable to patients with smaller primary tumors, e.g., cases diagnosed at breast cancer screening.
 The higher tumor proliferative activity and frequency of aneuploidy in early OC users are in line with previously reported findings of worse prognostic indicators and a worse survival in early users of OC compared with other young women with breast cancer.

 Seven patients had delayed Williams' vulvovaginoplasty after supralevator total pelvic exenteration.
 Of the three patients who died of carcinoma of the cervix (at 2, 5, and 15 months after vulvovaginoplasty), the first died before having a chance to attempt intercourse, but the other two had reported intercourse on at least two occasions after the reconstruction.
 One of the patients described the experiences as neither pleasant nor unpleasant but stated that her husband seemed satisfied.
 The other patient described the experience as satisfactory to both herself and her husband.
 The remaining four patients are alive with no evidence of recurrent disease at 28, 42, 56, and 106 months after operation.
 Two of these patients have reported entirely satisfactory sexual relations approximating pre-exenteration frequency, but the remaining two have not had sexual relations since surgery.
 Both give the main reason for this as lack of opportunity.

 This study investigated metabolic and nutritional factors in association with athletic menstrual dysfunction (AMD).
 Three groups of women were studied: amenorrheic runners (amenorrheic), eumenorrheic runners (eumenorrheic), and eumenorrheic sedentary controls (sedentary).
 Amenorrheic and eumenorrheic were similar in age, weight, percent body fat by hydrodensitometry, training pace and mileage, best 10 km race time, years running, and maximal oxygen consumption.
 When adjusted for body weight or for fat-free mass by analysis of covariance, RMR was significantly lower in amenorrheic than in eumenorrheic and sedentary.
 The daily caloric intakes of the groups did not differ significantly, but the amenorrheic scored significantly higher than the eumenorrheic and sedentary on a scale of aberrant eating patterns.
 Amenorrheic high mileage runners seem to have a less adequate diet than eumenorrheic runners but appear to maintain energy balance and stable weight through a reduction in RMR.

 Vaginal stenosis or foreshortening following surgery or radiation therapy can lead to dyspareunia.
 This report concerns the successful use of full-thickness skin grafts taken from the flank overlying the iliac crest to treat vaginal stenosis or foreshortening.
 The operation consists of incising the involved area and creating a space which will become the recipient site.
 An elliptical piece of full-thickness skin harvested from the area overlying the iliac crest is cleared of underlying fat, trimmed to fit the recipient site, and sutured in place.
 Vaginal packing is used to keep the graft against the recipient bed.
 Ten patients have been treated successfully with this technique, without significant complications or sequelae.
 Follow-up from 6 weeks to 42 months showed excellent postsurgical vaginal capacity in all patients.
 Similarly, excellent functional results were achieved in eight patients, with distinct improvement in the remaining two.

 OBJECTIVE: To extend the knowledge on long-term effects of childhood abuse in psychiatric patients to a large sample, the authors explored childhood sexual and physical abuse in adult inpatients over 1,040 consecutive admissions.
 METHOD: The 947 patients were admitted to a tertiary-care military medical center.
 Each patient was interviewed, and abuse history, DSM-III-R diagnosis, and other characteristics were recorded.
 RESULTS: The prevalence of reported childhood abuse was 18% overall: 9% for sexual abuse (with or without physical abuse), 10% for physical abuse (with or without sexual abuse), and 3% for combined abuse.
 More female than male patients reported abuse.
 Alcohol use disorders were more common in victims of physical or combined abuse than in sexually abused or nonabused patients.
 Axis II diagnoses, particularly borderline personality disorder, were more frequent in abuse victims than in nonabused patients.
 Histories of drug and alcohol abuse were more common in patients reporting physical or combined abuse than in nonabused patients.
 Suicidality was also more frequent in abused than nonabused inpatients and was noted in 79% of the patients with histories of combined abuse.
 Combined abuse in women and physical abuse in men were associated with a family history of psychiatric illness, most commonly alcoholism in male relatives.
 CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the need for greater attention to family dynamics, aggressive diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism within the family, and, especially, determination of patients' abuse histories, even if repeated questioning is necessary.

1031,"The noncatalytic src homology region 2 segment of abl tyrosine kinase binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular proteins with high affinity.
 Several proteins implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation contain a common noncatalytic domain, src homology region 2 (SH2).
 We have used the bacterially expressed SH2 domain of abl protein-tyrosine kinase to evaluate the ability of this domain to bind to cellular proteins.
 ablSH2 specifically bound to a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from cells transformed by tyrosine kinase oncogenes in a filter-binding assay and to a subset of those proteins in solution.
 The SH2 probe bound almost exclusively to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, and binding was eliminated by dephosphorylation of cell proteins.
 Free phosphotyrosine could partially disrupt SH2 binding, suggesting that phosphotyrosine is directly involved in the binding interaction.
 These results demonstrate that an SH2 domain is sufficient to confer direct, high-affinity phosphotyrosine-dependent binding to proteins and suggest a general role for SH2 domains in cellular signaling pathways.

 Histological study disclosed a predominantly papillary tumor with hyalinized vessels.
 Tumor cells were scarcely positive with immunohistochemical stain for glial fibrillary acidic protein, extensive and diffusely positive with vimentin and neuron-specific enolase, and intensely positive with S-100 and epithelial membrane antigen in the papillary areas.
 Ultrastructural study showed abundant intermediate filaments forming bundles in tumoral cytoplasms, membrane junctions, and external laminae when cells were in contact with collagen fibers.
 Based on immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characteristics, we believe that the filaments seen in tumor cells are mainly vimentin filaments.

 Colorectal and anal sphincter motility and electrophysiology were investigated in 14 women with profound constipation following hysterectomy and compared with an asymptomatic group of control subjects.
 Twelve patients complained of significant urinary symptoms.
 No differences in the motor function of the anal sphincters were detectable.
 The latency of the pudendoanal reflex was unchanged after hysterectomy.
 Proctometrograms demonstrated significantly increased rectal volumes and compliance in the hysterectomy group together with deficits of rectal sensory function.
 In the basal state a significant proximal-to-distal sigmoid colon motility gradient existed only in the control group.
 Following stimulation with Prostigmin, this gradient was enhanced in the control group but paradoxically reversed in the hysterectomized patients, thus constituting a functional obstruction.
 Denervation supersensitivity was demonstrable in two patients tested with carbachol provocation but not in control subjects.
 These findings suggest dysfunction in the autonomic innervation of the hindgut in some patients who had undergone hysterectomy, resulting in severe constipation.

 Patients with complex or surgically difficult intracranial aneurysms are being treated with interventional neurovascular techniques.
 With neuroleptic anesthesia and a transfemoral femoral approach, a silicone micro-balloon can be flow directed through the intracranial circulation, guided directly into the aneurysm, and detached.
 The aneurysm is thus eliminated from the circulation, and the parent artery is preserved.
 For broad-based or ectatic aneurysms, test occlusion followed by permanent occlusion of the aneurysm and parent vessel can be performed.
 Since 1981, 211 patients with 215 aneurysms, including 177 cases involving the anterior and 38 cases involving the posterior circulation, have been treated with this technique.
 In 127 cases (59.1%), the parent vessel was occluded; in 88 cases (40.9%), primary occlusion of the aneurysm was achieved with preservation of the parent artery.
 Therapy-related complications included 21 deaths (9.8%) and 16 strokes (7.4%).
 Follow-up examinations were performed at 1, 3, and 12 months after treatment, and follow-up ranged from 5 months to 9 years.
 In patients in whom standard surgical therapy fails or for aneurysms in surgically inaccessible anatomic locations, interventional techniques that make use of detachable balloons may be a useful therapeutic alternative.

 PURPOSE AND PATIENTS AND METHODS: We observed a series of patients in whom the diagnosis of mitral stenosis was first discovered in the echocardiography laboratory.
 Because of this experience, we examined the records of 152 patients with echocardiographic evidence of rheumatic mitral stenosis to determine the clinical characteristics and course of patients with unsuspected mitral stenosis as well as those factors that may have obscured the diagnosis.
 RESULTS: Of these 152 patients, 18 had mitral stenosis that was unsuspected clinically until the echocardiogram.
 These patients were elderly, with a median age of 72 years.
 They were all referred for echocardiography because of cardiac symptoms.
 Eight patients were referred for evaluation of congestive heart failure.
 Five patients were referred for evaluation of aortic valve disease.
 Three patients were referred because of cerebrovascular accidents and atrial fibrillation.
 The Doppler-determined mean diastolic mitral gradient ranged from 4 to 15 mm Hg (mean: 7 mm Hg).
 Mitral stenosis ranged in severity from trivial to very severe.
 Eight patients had moderate to severe mitral stenosis with estimated mitral valve areas less than or equal to 1.5 cm2.
 Seven had mild or trivial mitral stenosis with estimated mitral valve areas greater than 1.5 cm2.
 After further evaluation, two patients underwent mitral valve surgery with improvement of congestive failure.
 In three patients, warfarin therapy was begun to prevent emboli.
 Thus, five of 18 patients had a significant immediate change in therapy because of the discovery of mitral stenosis.
 CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of mitral stenosis may not be suspected in the presence of advanced age, other serious cardiac and medical conditions, or mechanical factors that complicate the physical examination.
 In these patients, mitral stenosis may be hemodynamically significant and may cause significant symptoms.

 OBJECTIVE: To assess the complex relationship between substance abuse and personality disorders, the authors determined the prevalence of personality disorders in a group of middle-class substance abusers and compared the subjects who had personality disorders with those who did not.
 METHOD: The subjects were drawn from patients consecutively admitted to an inpatient substance abuse program in a private psychiatric hospital; they were the first 100 who agreed to participate.
 Substance dependence was diagnosed according to DSM-III-R, and the patients were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders, Alcohol Use Inventory, MMPI, Health and Daily Living Form, Shipley Institute of Living Scale, and measures of chemical use and life satisfaction.
 RESULTS: Of the 100 substance abusers, 57 had personality disorders.
 These patients differed significantly from the 43 patients without personality disorders in several ways: they had greater involvement with illegal drugs, had different patterns of alcohol use, had greater psychopathology, were less satisfied with their lives, and were more impulsive, isolated, and depressed.

1047,"Identification and preliminary characterization of protein-cysteine farnesyltransferase.
 Ras proteins must be isoprenylated at a conserved cysteine residue near the carboxyl terminus (Cys-186 in mammalian Ras p21 proteins) in order to exert their biological activity.
 Previous studies indicate that an intermediate in the mevalonate pathway, most likely farnesyl pyrophosphate, is the donor of this isoprenyl group.
 Inhibition of mevalonate synthesis reverts the abnormal phenotypes induced by the mutant RAS2Val-19 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and blocks the maturation of Xenopus oocytes induced by an oncogenic Ras p21 protein of human origin.
 These results have raised the possibility of using inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway to block the transforming properties of ras oncogenes.
 Unfortunately, mevalonate is a precursor of various end products essential to mammalian cells, such as dolichols, ubiquinones, heme A, and cholesterol.
 In this study, we describe an enzymatic activity(ies) capable of catalyzing the farnesylation of unprocessed Ras p21 proteins in vitro at the correct (Cys-186) residue.
 This farnesylating activity is heat-labile, requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions, is linear with time and with enzyme concentration, and is present in all mammalian cell lines and tissues tested.
 Gel filtration analysis of a partially purified preparation of protein farnesyltransferase revealed two peaks of activity at 250-350 kDa and 80-130 kDa.
 Availability of an in vitro protein farnesyltransferase assay should be useful in screening for potential inhibitors of ras oncogene function that will not interfere with other aspects of the mevalonate pathway.

 In this study we evaluated the effects of once-daily administration of oral doxazosin in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF).
 After a stabilization period of at least 2 weeks with digitalis and diuretics, 73 patients with chronic CHF were randomized to receive additionally either doxazosin or placebo in double-blind fashion.
 Patients underwent weekly dose adjustments with increasing doses of doxazosin (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 mg daily) or placebo for 5 weeks, and 67 were evaluated for 12 additional weeks on maximally tolerated doses of blinded study drugs.
 Treatment groups were evaluated with respect to symptoms of heart failure, indexes of quality of life and left ventricular function, frequency and type of arrhythmia, adverse events, and mortality rates.
 Doxazosin (11.9 +/- 0.9 mg) given once daily produced a favorable trend in the investigators' and patients' assessments of symptomatic change.
 Doxazosin was associated with a significantly higher level of voluntary submaximal exercise and a favorable trend on left ventricular ejection fraction (increase of 9.8% of the baseline value vs 2.7% with placebo; p = NS).
 During the 3-month steady-dosing period, patients treated with doxazosin had a significant (p less than 0.004) reduction in ventricular arrhythmias and significantly fewer morbid and mortal cardiac events (including episodes of worsening heart failure severe enough to prompt discontinuation of the study, myocardial infarction, and death).

 Dorsal root ganglionectomy has been suggested as a method for the treatment of chronic intractable radicular pain, with theoretical advantages over dorsal rhizotomy, which does not interrupt ventral root afferents.
 The indications for these procedures in patients with persistent pain following lumbosacral spine surgery are not well established.
 Long-term results have been reported infrequently, and no published series has a mean follow-up period of more than 30 months.
 The authors have reviewed their experience with a series of 13 patients with failed back surgery syndrome, in whom dorsal root ganglionectomy was performed.
 Patients were selected on the basis of clinical presentation and diagnostic root blocks suggesting a monoradicular pain syndrome.
 Follow-up data were obtained at a mean of 5.5 years following dorsal root ganglionectomy.
 Follow-up interviews to assess outcome were conducted by a disinterested third party.
 Treatment ""success"" (at least 50% sustained relief of pain and patient satisfaction with the result) was recorded in two patients at 2 years after surgery and in none at 5.5 years.
 Equivocal success (at least 50% relief, without clearcut patient satisfaction) was recorded in one patient at 2 and at 5.5 years postoperatively.
 Improvements in activities of daily living were recorded in a minority of patients.
 Loss of sensory and motor function was reported frequently by patients.
 A minority of patients had reduced or eliminated analgesic intake.
 These results suggest that dorsal root ganglionectomy has a limited role in the management of failed back surgery syndrome, and that methods to select patients to receive this procedure should be refined or alternative approaches should be considered.

1050,"New chemotherapies for ovarian cancer. Systemic and intraperitoneal podophyllotoxins.
 The epipodophyllotoxin derivatives etoposide and teniposide have been evaluated intermittently for possible use in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
 Conflicting studies suggest that variables such as dose and prior treatment have a major influence on outcome.
 Response rates ranged from 0% to 40% in five series with teniposide, and from less than a 10% overall response rate to greater than a 10% complete response rate in nine studies with etoposide.
 One study documented activity with oral etoposide.
 However, because all patients had received various prior chemotherapies, firm conclusions regarding the activity of etoposide could not be drawn.
 These results, and the expectation of synergy with etoposide and cisplatin, led to several studies that combined etoposide with platin compounds by the systemic and intraperitoneal (IP) routes.
 Various studies have used intravenous drug combinations of these agents in both previously treated and untreated patients.
 One study, which used carboplatin instead of cisplatin, reported only seven failures among 26 previously untreated patients.
 Conversely, the prominent toxicities reported by another study were discouraging, and responses did not exceed what might be expected from cisplatin alone.
 Studies of analogous combinations administered IP are ongoing.
 A favorable experience, which was initially reported by the University of California (San Diego group), is being confirmed by other investigators.
 This has prompted the incorporation of etoposide into first-line strategies.
 The pharmacologic advantage of etoposide by the IP route (related to its high protein binding) may provide appropriate dose intensity against IP disease while sparing systemic toxicities.
 Finally, systemic dose intensity with autologous bone marrow support indicates some promise for etoposide in combination with high-dose alkylating drugs.

1051,"Comparison of supraannular and subannular pledgeted sutures in mitral valve replacement 
 Ten fresh canine hearts were used to compare the peak left ventricular pressure required to disrupt prosthetic mitral valves sutured in place with horizontal mattress sutures with either subannular or supraannular pledgets.
 Each group consisted of 5 animals.
 A 29-mm Medtronic mitral valve was secured in the mitral position with ten pledgeted sutures.
 The aorta was cannulated and normal saline solution was infused into the left ventricle until valvar disruption occurred.
 The peak pressure and the location and mechanism of disruption were then noted.
 At the peak left ventricular pressure required for valvar disruption, no individual sutures were broken.
 Instead, in all specimens a subannular myocardial rupture occurred in the posterior portion of the mitral annulus along the extent of the atrioventricular groove.
 In addition, the posterior wall of the left atrium dissected upward subsequently.
 Significantly greater pressures were required in the group with subannular suture placement as compared with the supraannular group (354 +/- 37 versus 236 +/- 33 mm Hg; p less than 0.0007).
 These data suggest that placement of horizontal mattress sutures with pledgets in the subannular position is superior to the currently recommended method of supraannular suture placement in mechanical valves.

1052,"Human catechol-O-methyltransferase: cloning and expression of the membrane-associated form.
 A cDNA clone for human catechol-O-methyltransferase (hCOMT; S-adenosyl-L-methionine:catechol O-methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.6) was isolated from a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2) cDNA library by hybridization screening with a porcine cDNA probe.
 The cDNA clone was sequenced and found to have an insert of 1226 nucleotides.
 The deduced primary structure of hCOMT is composed of 271 amino acid residues with the predicted molecular mass of 30 kDa.
 At its N terminus it has a hydrophobic segment of 21 amino acid residues that may be responsible for insertion of hCOMT into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
 The primary structure of hCOMT exhibits high homology to the porcine partial cDNA sequence (93%).
 The deduced amino acid sequence contains two tryptic peptide sequences (T-22, T-33) found in porcine liver catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT).
 The coding region of hCOMT cDNA was placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter to transfect human kidney 293 cells.
 The endogenous COMT activity, which was approximately 9.98 units per mg of protein in the untransfected cells, increased to 206 units per mg of protein upon transfection with a plasmid containing the COMT cDNA.
 The COMT activity of recombinant protein was inhibited competitively (IC50 = 700 nM) by the selective COMT inhibitor Ro 40-7592.
 An anti-COMT monoclonal antibody recognized, on immunoblots, a major polypeptide with apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa, in reasonable agreement with the predicted molecular mass.
 The recombinant hCOMT was shown by immunoblot analysis to be mainly associated with the membrane fraction.
 RNA blot analysis revealed one COMT mRNA transcript of 1.4 kilobases in Hep G2 poly(A)+ RNA.

1053,"Ischemic heart disease and platelet aggregation. The Caerphilly Collaborative Heart Disease Study.
 The Caerphilly Collaborative Heart Disease Study is based on a large cohort of men (2,398) aged 49-66 years at the time of study.
 Platelet aggregation induced by collagen, thrombin, and ADP was measured in fasting blood samples and was related to prevalent angina, past myocardial infarction, and electrocardiographic evidence of ischemic heart disease.
 A number of subjects had taken aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or other drugs affecting platelet aggregation 7 days before blood sample collection; after the exclusion of these subjects, data were available for 1,811 men.
 No relations were demonstrated with angina, but significant relations were shown between past myocardial infarctions and electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia and ADP-induced aggregation (both primary and secondary) and between electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia and thrombin-induced aggregation.
 The strongest relation indicated more than a twofold increase in the odds of a past myocardial infarction in subjects of the highest fifth of ADP-induced primary platelet aggregation compared with the lowest fifth.
 No significant relations were detected with collagen-induced aggregation.
 Accounting for a number of possible confounding factors had a relatively small impact on the relations between platelet aggregation and ischemic heart disease.
 Other evidence, including the well-established effect of aspirin on reducing the incidence of ischemic heart disease, indicates that the relations we describe are unlikely to be simply an effect of IHD on platelets.

 A case of pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (PMC) with two pseudosarcomatous mural nodules (PMN) is described.
 These nodules have not been previously described in this type of tumor.
 In ovarian mucinous tumors (OMT), similar nodules have been reported, the nature of which has been discussed in detail.
 Here the similarity between the tumor described here and ovarian tumors is stressed.
 The immunohistochemical study carried out disclosed in the nodules strong positive staining for vimentin and moderate positivity for keratin and epithelial membrane antigen.
 These findings, along with histologic details, favor the epithelial nature of the nodules.
 It was concluded that the nodules are foci of anaplastic carcinoma with high proliferative cell rate, which could explain the coexpression of vimentin and keratin.

1055,"Mechanism of early ischemic contractile failure. Inexcitability, metabolite accumulation, or vascular collapse?
 The basis of early ischemic contractile failure was investigated in perfused ferret hearts at 27 degrees C.
 Isovolumic left ventricular developed pressure fell by more than 50% within 30 seconds of the onset of total global ischemia and reached zero by 5 minutes.
 Monophasic action potential recordings revealed no decrease in excitability during this period.
 Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectra obtained at 30-second resolution showed no significant changes in inorganic phosphate or phosphocreatine during the first 30 seconds of ischemia.
 Intracellular pH (pHi) and ATP changed even more slowly; therefore, none of these metabolites could account for the rapid fall in force.
 To gauge the contribution of intravascular pressure, we compared ordinary aortic flow occlusion with tissue-level ischemia induced by massive coronary microembolization at the level of the precapillary arterioles.
 Functional depression developed significantly more slowly in the microembolized hearts, despite accumulation of inorganic phosphate and protons comparable with that in ordinary ischemia.
 After microembolization, the time course of functional depression reflected much more closely the concomitant inorganic phosphate and pHi changes.
 Thus, our results provide novel evidence supporting the importance of vascular collapse in the mechanism of early ischemic contractile failure.

1056,"Acute alcohol ingestion reduces fatty acid extraction of the heart, liver, and small intestine.
 Ethanol may have profound effects on both the distribution of perfusion and substrate utilization by the liver and heart due to its vasodilating properties and the generation of high levels of circulating acetate and lactate.
 Since fatty acids are highly extracted by the heart and liver under normal circumstances, changes in the relationship of perfusion/fatty acid uptake may be a sensitive indicator of both altered perfusion and changes in metabolic substrate availability.
 To test this hypothesis, studies were performed in rats fed 3.1, 6.2, and 9.3 g/kg doses of ethanol.
 Fatty acid uptake was estimated with a 3-methyl substituted reagent with a chain length equivalent to 17 carbons.
 The methyl group in the three position prevented beta oxidation and prolonged the residence of fatty acids in the tissue.
 Eighteen hours after acute alcohol administration, fatty acid uptake was reduced in the heart and the small intestine; in the liver uptake was increased or unchanged.
 Acute ethanol administration also resulted in increased perfusion, as indicated by enhanced uptake of 201thallium by the heart, liver, and small intestine.
 The fatty acid extraction of the heart, liver, and small intestine, defined as the concentration of fatty acid divided by the concentration of 201thallium, was markedly decreased by alcohol ingestion.
 These alcohol effects were dose-dependent and temporally related.
 The data suggest that ethanol ingestion could potentially alter heart function during exercise or following a prolonged fast, when the heart relies primarily upon fatty acids extracted from the circulation to generated adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

 Guidelines for management in the asymptomatic patient with a smooth-blunt gastric foreign body are not well established in the pediatric literature.
 Questionnaires were sent to pediatricians, family practitioners, pediatric gastroenterologists and pediatric surgeons with an over-all response rate of 62.2%.
 There was no agreement in regard to how long one should observe such patients before recommending intervention.
 There was no correlation of years of clinical experience and length of observation recommended either.
 Review of the pre-endoscopic literature revealed spontaneous evacuation in 93-99% of all types of foreign bodies in 1477 pediatric patients.
 An observation period of at least eight weeks should be strongly considered in an asymptomatic patient with a smooth-blunt gastric foreign body.
 Exceptions would include an anatomic abnormality of the gastric outlet, previous gastric outlet surgery as well as a possibly toxic object.

 Five intraductal papillary neoplasms of the pancreas were analyzed for the presence of the Ras gene mutations.
 Three (60%) of the five neoplasms showed point mutations at K-ras codon 12.
 This incidence of the mutations was rather low compared with that found with ordinary pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
 The presence of the mutations did not correlate with the severity of cellular atypia, but was apparently related to the size of the tumor.
 The two neoplasms that had no mutations were smaller than the others that had mutations.
 The analysis suggested that Ras gene mutation is not the first genetic alteration of tumor progression, but that it occurs during the development of neoplasms of the pancreas.

 Emergency intubations are done for a variety of reasons in the emergency department (ED).
 In some patients, a rapid, controlled induction of anesthesia is useful to facilitate intubation and to reduce the complications of intubation.
 This is referred to a rapid sequence induction (RSI) in the anesthesia literature.
 Atropine, thiopental, fentanyl, diazepam, ketamine, vecuronium, succinylcholine, other drugs and their applications for RSI are described.
 The purpose of this article is to describe the use of RSI in the airway management of ED patients.
 Nineteen pediatric patients requiring emergency intubation were intubated using RSI with vecuronium and thiopental.
 Actual intubation difficulty using RSI was significantly less than the anticipated intubation difficulty without RSI.
 There were no complications caused by intubation or RSI that had a significant impact on patient outcome.
 We feel that a sedative in combination with vecuronium represents the most optimal means of achieving RSI in the ED setting.
 Although the induction of general anesthesia is best done by anesthesiologists, emergency physicians are often the most experienced physicians immediately available to manage an airway in a critical emergency.
 An objective protocol such as that described will make it easier for emergency physicians to perform this procedure when needed.

 In a long-term longitudinal study of gestational diabetes mellitus in Black women, risk factors that were identified were age, obesity, a family history of diabetes, and the presence of hypertension.
 Poor predictors were a history of a previous large-for-date infant, parity, and age at first pregnancy.
 The prevalence of smooth muscle and nuclear autoantibodies was higher in gestational diabetic subjects.
 Gestational diabetic subjects who required insulin for glycemic control were more obese, had a lower frequency of the Bf-F phenotype and a higher frequency of the Bf-F1 phenotype, and had a lower frequency of the type 2 allele at the polymorphic locus adjacent to the insulin gene.
 Restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms flanking the insulin and apolipoprotein A-I and C-III genes, although not associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, may be associated with hyperlipidemia and subsequent atherosclerosis.

 Thirty-eight patients with small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), size less than 20 mm, initially detected by ultrasound (US) and histologically confirmed, were examined by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, computed tomographic (CT) scan, and angiography.
 MR imaging demonstrated HCC nodules in nine (75.0%) of 12 patients with tumors less than 10 mm in diameter and in 22 (84.6%) of 26 patients with tumors 10-20 mm in diameter.
 In total, HCC nodules were detected in 31 of 38 patients (81.6%) by MR imaging.
 On the other hand, HCC lesions were found on CT scan in 14 of 26 patients (53.8%) and in 27 of 35 patients (77.1%) by angiography.
 With MR imaging, HCC nodules were demonstrated in 21 of 31 patients on both T1 and T2 weighted images, and 13 of 21 patients (61.9%) were shown to have low intensity areas or iso intensity areas on T1 weighted image, whereas the other eight patients (38.1%) were shown to have high intensity areas.
 All 21 patients were shown to have high intensity areas on T2 weighted image.
 Among 15 resected cases, four patients had a high intensity area on T1 weighted image, and a significant fatty change was noted in HCC nodules by histological study of the resected specimen.
 We suggest that MR imaging is a useful diagnostic imaging modality, even in small HCC of less than 20 mm.

 Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) inhibited the chemiluminescence (CL) from mouse peritoneal cells initiated by zymosan, carrageenin and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and CL generated by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction and the lipid peroxidation in the rat brain homogenate.
 The inhibitory activity of PQQ was more potent than that of idebenone, alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid in all the three assay systems.
 In the xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction, PQQ had no effect on the formation of uric acid at the concentration of CL inhibition.
 These results suggest that PQQ might have a radical scavenger-like activity.
 Structure-activity relationship of PQQ and its six related compounds showed that the 7- and 9-carboxyl groups of PQQ as well as the orthoquinone structure are responsible for the radical scavenger-like activity.
 In addition, the -NH group in the pyrrole ring of PQQ seemed to be essential for the antilipid peroxidative activity in the rat brain homogenate.
 When administered i.p., PQQ inhibited the development of 0.1% carrageenin-induced paw edema in rats.
 These results suggest that PQQ might have therapeutic effects on various diseases, of which development or exacerbation has been known to be associated with radical oxygens.

1065,"Heart rate changes as an autonomic component of the pain response.
 Autonomic variables have been recommended as measures of the affective-motivational component of the pain response in objective algesimetry.
 In the present study components of heart rate responses to painful heat stimuli and their relation to stimulus and sensation variables were analyzed.
 Twelve healthy subjects served.
 Sixty phasic stimuli of varying temperatures above and below pain threshold were delivered through a Marstock thermode in 1 session.
 Heart rate, respiration, and subjective stimulus ratings were recorded simultaneously.
 Phasic heat stimulation above and below pain threshold induced a tonic increase of the heart rate lasting up to more than 20 sec.
 High intensity stimulation generated steeper rises and greater mean increase than low intensity stimulation.
 In general, heart rate responses were more closely related to subjective sensation than to stimulus intensity.
 However, differential temporal analysis demonstrates that, until about 3 sec after stimulation, the autonomic response is determined solely by stimulus temperature, whereas, after approximately 6 sec, it is related only to subjective judgement.
 Accordingly, the heart rate responses reflect both a brief nocifensive reflex induced by the sensory component and, subsequently, a longer-lasting response which seems to be related to affective and/or cognitive evaluation.
 This separation of different stages of pain-processing by an autonomic indicator may be useful in clinical algesimetry.

 BACKGROUND.
 The present study was designed to evaluate the efficiency of a newly developed troponin T enzyme immunoassay for the detection of acute myocardial infarction.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 The study comprised 388 patients admitted with chest pain and suspected myocardial infarction and 101 patients with skeletal muscle damage and additional suspected myocardial cell damage.
 Troponin T was elevated to more than twice the analytical sensitivity of the assay (0.5 microgram/l) in all patients with non-Q wave (range, 1.2-5 micrograms/l) and Q wave infarction (range, 3-220 micrograms/l).
 Troponin T appeared in serum as early as 3 hours after onset of pain in 50% of the patients and remained elevated in all patients for more than 130 hours, revealing release kinetics of both free cytosolic and structurally bound molecules.
 The diagnostic efficiency of troponin T was superior to that of creatine kinase-MB (98% versus 97%) and remained at 98% until 5.5 days after admission, if patients with unstable angina were excluded from analysis.
 In the 79 patients with unstable angina, troponin T was elevated (range, 0.55-3.1 micrograms/l) in at least one blood sample from each of 37 patients (56%).
 Circulating troponin T was correlated to the presence of reversible ST segment or T wave changes on the electrocardiogram (p less than 0.005) and to the frequency of in-hospital complications.
 In the 101 patients with skeletal muscle damage and suspected additional cardiac muscle damage, troponin T was the most useful test; its efficiency was 89% or 94% (depending on the discriminator value used) as compared with 63% for creatine kinase-MB.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Thus, the data of the study indicate that the newly developed troponin T test improves the efficiency of serodiagnostic tools for the detection of myocardial cell necrosis as compared with conventionally used cardiac enzymes.

 AV reciprocating tachycardia was induced in 9 of the 22 patients with AV reciprocating tachycardia when they were in the supine position and in 17 when standing.
 The effective refractory period of the AV node markedly shortened, from 275 +/- 72 to 203 +/- 30 ms (n = 16, p less than 0.005) after standing.
 The effective refractory period of the accessory pathway shortened slightly, from 293 +/- 75 to 278 +/- 77 ms (n = 8, p less than 0.005), after standing.
 AV node reentrant tachycardia was induced in 3 of the 11 patients with AV node reentrant tachycardia when they were in the supine position and in 6 when standing.
 The effective refractory periods of the slow pathway and fast pathway shortened markedly, from 293 +/- 72 to 216 +/- 40 ms (n = 6, p less than 0.025) and from 416 +/- 85 to 277 +/- 50 ms (n = 10, p less than 0.005), respectively, after standing.
 Plasma norepinephrine levels increased during standing both in patients with AV reciprocating and in those with AV node reentrant tachycardia (n = 11, p less than 0.005, n = 8, p less than 0.005, respectively).

 In summary, a remarkably close agreement exists for the mean MEE measured in 28 studies of severe burn trauma.
 This is especially surprising given the variability in sample sizes, measurement techniques, study designs, and DPBs studied.
 The mean MEE calculated from the data published in these reports is listed in the final column of Table I.
 For more than 450 cases, an unweighted MEE is 2750 +/- 85 kcal/day.
 For those studies prior to 1980, the mean MEE exceeds 3000 kcal/day in eight of 14 reports vs only two of 14 published after 1980.
 Even so, the mean MEE for the pre-1980 reports differs by only 200 kcal/day (2960 +/- 120, n = 14).
 The accepted notion that the degree of elevation in MEE is in proportion to the % BSAB up to about 60% BSAB is useful in a general sense but must be applied with caution.
 The recent studies, which include proportionately more burns exceeding 80% BSAB, suggest an elevation in MEE in these cases.
 Nevertheless, a physiologic plateau apparently exists at or slightly below 2 x normal RMR at the peak of MEE.
 The magnitude of the MEE response results from an undefined interaction among several factors of which some have been examined while others such as inflammatory mediators are only beginning to receive study.
 The contributions to reduction in MEE from interventions to control cardiac output and peripheral cooling, core temperature, evaporative water (heat) loss, and substrate cycling have been reviewed.
 The importance of indirect calorimetry in patient care is highlighted by the large variability in similarly injured individuals and in the unexplained component of regression analyses.

 A recent increase in the popularity of selective rhizotomy for reduction of spasticity in cerebral palsy has led to a demand for more objective studies of outcome and long-term follow-up results.
 The authors present the results of gait analysis on 14 children with spastic cerebral palsy, who underwent selective posterior rhizotomy in 1985.
 Sagittal plane gait patterns were studied before surgery and at 1 and 3 years after surgery using a digital camera system.
 The parameters measured included the range of motion at the knee and thigh, stride length, speed of walking, and cadence.
 The range of motion at the knee was significantly increased at 1 year after surgery and further improved to a nearly normal range at 3 years after surgery.
 In contrast, postoperative measurements of thigh range exceeded normal values at 1 year, but decreased toward normal range at 3 years.
 While improvements in range of motion continued between Years 1 and 3, the children developed a more extended thigh and knee position, which indicated a more upright walking posture.
 Stride length and speed of walking also improved, while cadence remained essentially unchanged.
 This 3-year follow-up study, the first to examine rhizotomy using an objective approach, has provided some encouraging results regarding early functional outcome.

 The timing of Q-wave evolution and its prognostic significance was studied in 201 patients who received thrombolytic therapy for a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
 One hundred forty-one patients (70%) had evidence of a Q-wave AMI within 3 hours of the initiation of thrombolytic therapy, 31 (16%) developed Q waves after 3 hours but before hospital discharge, and 29 (14%) were discharged with a non-Q-wave AMI.
 Laboratory indicators of myocardial damage and in-hospital morbidity and mortality were greater among patients with Q-wave AMIs than with non-Q-wave AMIs.
 When these indexes were examined with respect to the timing of Q-wave evolution, the prognosis of patients with delayed Q-wave development was similar to that of patients with non-Q-wave AMIs.
 Thus, compared to patients with early (less than or equal to 3 hours) Q-wave evolution, patients with delayed Q-wave evolution or with a non-Q-wave AMI had a smaller creatine kinase peak (mean 661 to 1,081 vs 1,251 to 1,541 IU; p = 0.005), better preservation of left ventricular function as measured by radionuclide ventriculography before discharge (mean +/- standard deviation 54 +/- 11% vs 47 +/- 13%; p less than 0.01), and a lower incidence of congestive heart failure at discharge (3 vs 15%; p = 0.02).

 Specifically, if damage sustained by the central nervous system is traced to a certain structure, it may provide insight on the extent of involvement and functional role of that structure in the control of movement.

 Because of these and previous clinical and laboratory data, etoposide is now given intravenously or orally in a 3-day to 5-day schedule.
 It is generally accepted that approximately 50% of the orally administered drug is absorbed.
 The authors have initiated several etoposide studies using an extended administration schedule, believing that a prolonged schedule may be superior to the standard 3-day to 5-day schedule.
 This was initially tested in a Phase I study.
 Results showed that etoposide (50 mg/m2/d) given over 21 days was feasible and was associated with only moderate toxicity.
 Several Phase II studies have been completed or are nearing completion, including studies in patients with SCLC, NHL, germ cell tumors, soft tissue sarcoma, renal carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma.
 Responses have been seen in all of these groups, particularly in patients with SCLC, lymphoma, and germ cell tumors.
 In these groups we saw responses in patients who were clearly resistant to etoposide plus cisplatin given in a standard schedule or in some patients who were resistant to high-dose etoposide with bone marrow transplantation.
 Investigators at Indiana University Medical Center who studied oral etoposide in a similar fashion in patients with advanced germ cell tumors and SCLC achieved results similar to those reported here.
 The authors have initiated a number of combination chemotherapy programs using the chronic oral form of etoposide.
 These include patients with SCLC, non-small cell lung cancer, and elderly patients with high-grade and intermediate forms of NHL.
 In addition, chronic intravenous oral etoposide is being used in salvage approaches for patients with acute myelocytic leukemia and recurrent resistant intermediate-grade and high-grade NHL.
 Preliminary pharmacokinetic data suggest that a 50-mg/m2 oral dose is highly bioavailable (91% to 96%).
 Therefore, during a prolonged oral course at 50 mg/m2, many patients maintain a minimum plasma concentration of 1 microgram/ml.
 Further studies of multiple dose or continuous infusion etoposide to maintain a potentially critical plasma level are in progress.
 Etoposide administered in this way could represent a ""new"" drug because many of its features are different, and its activity spectrum may be broader.

1076,"Six years' audit of laboratory workload and rates of referral for colposcopy in a cervical screening programme in three districts 
 OBJECTIVE--To determine laboratory workload and rates of referral for colposcopy in a three district cervical screening programme during 1983-9 to assess the feasibility of accommodating call up of all women at risk, recall at three year intervals (now five year intervals), and investigation of women with all degrees of abnormality.
 DESIGN--Analysis of computerised screening histories dating back to 1977 of women screened in the Avon cervical screening programme.
 SETTING--Three district health authorities covering the population of Bristol and Weston-super-Mare, comprising 800,000 people, of whom 250,000 were female residents aged 20 to 64.
 SUBJECTS--196,977 Women aged 20 to 64 screened in cervical screening programme since 1983.
 RESULTS--Laboratory workload devoted to follow up of women with abnormalities increased sharply between 1987-8 and 1988-9, with increases of 54% (from 2075 to 3196) in the number of smears for follow up of severe dyskaryosis and invasive cancer, 40% (from 1925 to 2695) for mild and moderate dyskaryosis, and 49% (from 1793 to 2677) for borderline change.
 The increases were partly explained by the introduction in April 1988 of protocols for follow up and investigation based on guidance in an intercollegiate working party report.
 The proportion of women with mild and moderate dyskaryosis who were recommended for referral for colposcopy increased steadily from 9.9% in 1983-4 to 79.9% in 1988-9, and for borderline change the proportions were 3.5% and 13.6% respectively.
 Of all women tested in 1988-9, referral for colposcopy was recommended in 3%.
 CONCLUSIONS--The increase in laboratory follow up work identified, if it continued, could result in half of existing laboratory capacity in Avon being devoted to follow up work by 1993, with little prospect of maintaining call, recall, and quality control.
 Investigation of all women with minor cytological abnormalities is neither justifiable nor sustainable and will undermine the benefits of screening by increasing the rate of false positive results and the financial costs.

1077,"The influence of extracorporeal circulation on erythrocytes and flow properties of blood.
 The influence of extracorporeal circulation on red blood cells and flow properties of blood was studied in 10 patients undergoing aorta-coronary bypass grafting.
 Blood samples were drawn on admission, under general anesthesia before the operation, during extracorporeal circulation, immediately after extracorporeal circulation, and 24 hours after extracorporeal circulation.
 Echinocytes were found during and shortly after extracorporeal circulation, but disappeared within 24 hours.
 Washing the cells in buffer restored the normal discocytic shape, which indicated that a plasma factor was responsible.
 Red cell membrane lipids were not affected.
 Analysis of the membrane proteins revealed a decrease of ankyrin after extracorporeal circulation, which was prevented by protease inhibitors during preparation.
 This suggests an increased proteolytic activity of the plasma after extracorporeal circulation.
 Red cell deformability was not altered.
 Plasma viscosity and hematocrit were markedly reduced by hemodilution with the priming solution.
 Their low levels resulted in a low blood viscosity during extracorporeal circulation, which was even lower at 26 degrees C than before or after the operation at 37 degrees C.
 We conclude that the red cell is affected by extracorporeal circulation.
 The flow properties of blood, however, are not impaired, but are improved by hemodilution.

 Thirty-one arterial macroaneurysms in 23 pediatric-aged patients (16 boys and 7 girls) were treated at the University of Michigan.
 The average age at time of diagnosis was 10.2 years (range 6 months to 18 years).
 Vessels involved the aorta (4), as well as hepatic (1), splenic (2), gastroepiploic (1), renal (12), iliac (1), superficial femoral (4), popliteal (1), brachial (1), radial (2), and ulnar (2) arteries.
 Twelve children exhibited overt clinical manifestations including presence of a mass (7), local pain (3), hematemesis (1), and painless obstructive jaundice (1).
 Eleven children had asymptomatic lesions.
 Aneurysm existence was confirmed by arteriography or operation.
 All but one child underwent surgical therapy, with 20 long-term survivors (mean follow-up 3.5 years).
 One operative death occurred and one death occurred 6 years after surgery.
 This experience and a review of previously reported cases served as a basis for categorization of childhood aneurysmal disease as true aneurysms associated with (I) arterial infection, (II) giant-cell aortoarteritis, (III) autoimmune connective tissue disease, (IV) Kawasaki's disease, (V) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or Marfan's syndrome, (VI) other forms of noninflammatory medial degeneration, (VII) arterial dysplasias, (VIII) congenital-idiopathic factors, as well as (IX) false aneurysms associated with extravascular events causing vessel wall injury or disruption.
 Knowledge of the varied clinicopathologic characteristics of arterial aneurysms in children is important in treating these patients.

 A brother and sister with long-standing symptoms of postural hypotension are described.
 They were considerably worse in the morning, after exercise and in warm weather.
 In the male, erection was unaffected but ejaculation was prolonged or absent.
 Both had nocturia, but there were no urinary bladder, bowel or sweating abnormalities.
 Autonomic function tests confirmed sympathetic adrenergic failure with spared sympathetic cholinergic and intact parasympathetic function.
 There were no other neurological abnormalities.
 Noradrenaline and adrenaline were undetectable in the plasma, but plasma dopamine was elevated.
 Urinary levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline metabolites were below detection limits, but dopamine metabolites were normal or elevated.
 Dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was undetectable in the plasma.
 Immunohistochemical studies of perivascular cutaneous tissue confirmed normal peptidergic and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, with absent dopamine beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity.
 The findings were consistent with an enzymatic deficit in the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline.
 The parents were clinically and biochemically normal.
 Treatment of both patients with the synthetic amino acid, d-l-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine, which contains a hydroxyl group and is converted to noradrenaline by dopa-decarboxylase, reduced symptoms and signs of postural hypotension and increased levels of plasma noradrenaline and its urinary metabolites.
 In the male, ejaculation became possible.
 Behavioural changes included a feeling of confidence and optimism, with a tendency to be argumentative.
 The laevo isomer also raised blood pressure and plasma noradrenaline levels.
 The drug had no direct pressor effects, as its actions were prevented by the dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa.

 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine physiologic responses and efficacy of 2, 1, and 1 mg/kg IM meperidine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine (MPC), respectively, in children.
 DESIGN: Prospective, unblinded trial.
 SETTING: A university and community emergency department.
 PATIENTS: Sixty-three hemodynamically and neurologically stable children.
 INTERVENTION: Single dose of IM MPC.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serial respirations, heart rate, arterial systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and Glasgow Coma Scale were measured at 30-minute intervals.
 Effectiveness was assessed by two independent observers using separate visual analog scales for cooperation and sedation.
 Times to sleep (27 +/- 24 minutes), sitting upright (103 +/- 87 minutes), ED discharge (4.7 +/- 2.4 hours), eating (11 +/- 7.9 hours), and normal behavior (19 +/- 15 hours) were acceptable.
 Minor, but statistically significant, changes in respiration rate (-1.9 +/- 0.4), heart rate (+4.5 +/- 1.8), oxygen saturation (-0.7 +/- 0.3%), and Glasgow Coma Scale (-2.5 +/- 0.6) occurred for 120 minutes after MPC.
 No serious complications or resuscitation were required.
 Mean visual analog scale scores were 5.0/10.4 or more in 71% of cases, with interobserver agreement very good (cooperation, r = .79; effectiveness, r = .80).
 Twenty-nine percent of children were judged insufficiently sedated.

 Home blood pressure monitoring can provide valuable information for physicians managing borderline hypertensive patients.
 This study was conducted to compare office and home blood pressures in 36 borderline hypertensive subjects, and to determine the accuracy of the home monitoring unit used.
 The patients were very willing to record their home blood pressures for an extended period of time.
 The home blood pressure monitors were found to be quite accurate, and blood pressures measured at home were significantly lower than readings obtained in the office.
 In 39% (14 of 36) of the subjects studied, the average home blood pressures were more than 10 mmHg lower than their office readings.
 These findings support the hypothesis that home blood pressure monitoring can be useful in the management of borderline hypertensive patients.

 The role of adrenal function in the anorectic response and adaptation of rats to a diet with an isoleucine (Ile) imbalance was investigated.
 In the first of four experiments, rats were fed a mildly Ile-imbalanced diet after treatment with metyrapone, and inhibitor of glucocorticoid synthesis.
 In two separate experiments, rats were presented with either a mildly or severely Ile-imbalanced diet (4.93 and 9.86% imbalanced amino acid mixture, respectively) after bilateral adrenalectomy.
 Finally, the effects of ICS 205-930, a serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, on the intake of mildly Ile-imbalanced diet were tested in adrenalectomized animals.
 In each experiment a 2 X 2 factorial design was used.
 Neither metyrapone nor adrenalectomy altered the initial depression in the intake of an imbalanced diet.
 The adaptation phase in the response of adrenalectomized rats fed a mildly Ile-imbalanced diet was not different from that of controls, but adrenalectomized rats fed severely Ile-imbalanced diets were unable to adapt.
 Adrenalectomy did not alter the anti-anoretic activity of ICS 205-930 in this model.
 These results suggest that adrenal hormones are not necessary for the initial anoretic response or adaptation of rats to an Ile-imbalanced diet, nor are they implicated in the anti-anorectic effect of serotonin-3 blockade.

 Patients were followed prospectively after surgery for the development of complications.
 The data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods.
 Postoperative complications were strongly associated with American Society of Anesthesiologists' classification, type of anesthesia, and type of operation.
 However, only a few laboratory tests, such as electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and nutritional status, were associated with postoperative complications.
 Therefore, in general, preoperative laboratory testing should only be undertaken for specific indications.

 We divided these patients into two groups.
 Group 1 was seen before 1970 and group 2 was seen from January 1970 to April 1989.
 There was a significant increase in the prevalence of malignancy in group 2 (47.2% versus 17.1%; p less than 0.0001) due to an increase in the number of lymphomas (22.6% versus 3.5%; p less than 0.001) and malignant neurogenic tumors (6.8% versus 1.1%; p = 0.0528).
 There was a significant increase in the number of malignant tumors in the anterior (59.5% versus 30.9%; p = 0.0022) and paravertebral (28.5% versus 2.8%; p = 0.0027) compartments in group 2.
 More patients with these tumors were symptomatic in group 2 (63.6% versus 5%; p = 0.0422).
 There was an increase of ancillary diagnostic studies performed to evaluate these tumors (76.0% versus 34.5%; p = 0.0422).

 The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of antiischemic treatment on left ventricular function in selected patients with unstable angina pectoris that was due to severe proximal left anterior descending coronary artery narrowing and to identify subgroups liable to an adverse outcome (mean term 2.7 years).
 Effect of antiischemic treatment on systolic and diastolic left ventricular wall motion was studied in 35 patients who had unstable angina pectoris and an electrocardiogram that indicated severe proximal left anterior descending coronary artery narrowing.
 Treatment consisted of either a revascularization procedure (17 patients) or antianginal drug therapy (18 patients).
 All patients underwent a two-dimensional echocardiographic study within 48 hours (mean 20 hours) of entry into the study.
 This study semiquantitatively analyzed systolic performance of the ischemia-related segments by calculation of a total wall motion score.
 In 16 patients this investigation was combined with a continuous detailed recording of only the apical interventricular septal wall motion.
 This detailed study included measurements for regional function by providing a typification of the pattern of systolic and early diastolic excursion of the endocardial border of the apical interventricular septum.
 A repeat ultrasonic study was performed at least 1 month (median 2 months, 7 days) after admission.

 Cancer is thought to arise from the accumulation of several genetic mutations in a single cell.
 Until recently, the only tumorigenic mutations that have been studied in detail are those that activate oncogenes.
 The discovery of tumor suppressor genes, for which inactivating mutations elicit tumorigenesis, has added a new dimension to our understanding of neoplasia.
 The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene RB is the prototype tumor suppressor gene and has been shown to suppress the transformed phenotype for several different cancers.
 Additional studies have revealed other tumor suppressor genes that may operate in a variety of tissues through a variety of mechanisms.
 These mechanisms may regulate the choice between cellular proliferation and differentiation and appear to involve such processes as the initiation of DNA replication, regulation of expression of certain genes, intercellular communication and adhesion, and the transduction of external signals to intracellular effectors.
 The elucidation of these mechanisms will enhance our understanding of both oncogenesis and the fundamental operations of the cell.

 We have isolated a 1.1-kilobase cDNA clone that encodes human fibrillarin by screening a hepatoma library in parallel with DNA probes derived from the fibrillarin genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NOP1) and Xenopus laevis.
 RNA blot analysis indicates that the corresponding mRNA is approximately 1300 nucleotides in length.
 Human fibrillarin expressed in vitro migrates on SDS gels as a 36-kDa protein that is specifically immunoprecipitated by antisera from humans with scleroderma autoimmune disease.
 Human fibrillarin contains an amino-terminal repetitive domain approximately 75-80 amino acids in length that is rich in glycine and arginine residues and is similar to amino-terminal domains in the yeast and Xenopus fibrillarins.
 The occurrence of a putative RNA-binding domain and an RNP consensus sequence within the protein is consistent with the association of fibrillarin with small nucleolar RNAs.
 Protein sequence alignments show that 67% of amino acids from human fibrillarin are identical to those in yeast fibrillarin and that 81% are identical to those in Xenopus fibrillarin.
 This identity suggests the evolutionary conservation of an important function early in the pathway for ribosome biosynthesis.

 Forty-one percent of admissions did not receive acute ICU treatments, but these admissions consumed less than 10 percent of ICU resources.

 In animal models using left ventricular assist systems over long time periods, myocardial cellular atrophy has been reported, raising concern that prolonged clinical use of such systems might lead to deterioration in left ventricular function.
 At the University of Pittsburgh, long-term clinical use of the Novacor (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Novacor Div., Oakland, Calif.) left ventricular support system for patients awaiting heart transplants has allowed study of the effects of long-term mechanical support on human subjects.
 This study determined that cardiac myocyte dimension is initially greater in patients with end-stage cardiac disease who require support rather than in patients with the same disease who do not require such support.
 Although myocyte dimension does decrease within a few days of the inception of support, this decrease merely brings cell size closer to the values usual in patients with chronic end-stage cardiac disease, and no further shrinkage is observed.
 Thus the Novacor left ventricular assist system does not appear associated with left ventricular atrophy, and its long-term use may not be detrimental to left ventricular function.

 Seventeen consecutive patients undergoing 20 planned aortic valve replacements with allograft valves at Stanford University Medical Center were studied with intraoperative epicardial echocardiography and Doppler color flow mapping before and after cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Native aortic valves were replaced in 12 of the 20 patients, and eight patients underwent second aortic valve procedures.
 In 17 of 20 patients allograft selection was guided by prebypass echocardiographic estimates of annular diameter and/or length of allograft aortic root required.
 Other prebypass findings included unanticipated severe mitral regurgitation in one patient (which precluded allograft aortic valve replacement), left-to-right shunts in five patients, ascending aortic dissection in one, and aortic root disease necessitating coronary reimplantation or bypass in two.
 Postbypass echocardiography demonstrated acceptable competency of 18 of 19 allograft valves (mild or no aortic insufficiency).
 Postbypass echocardiography also documented successful repair of four of five shunts and mild mitral regurgitation in 15 of 19 patients (versus 11 of 19 before bypass).
 Conclusions: Intraoperative echocardiography-Doppler mapping is a useful adjunct for allograft aortic valve or aortic root replacement; it allows confident selection of appropriate tissue size before aortic cross clamping, which minimizes delay from allograft thawing procedures.
 It also provides helpful information about the extent of aortic root disease and coronary ostial anatomy before bypass, confirms allograft competency after bypass, and detects accompanying valvular and other hemodynamic lesions before and after allograft valve replacement.

 The modern era for splenic surgery for injury began in 1892 when Riegner reported a splenectomy in a 14-year-old construction worker who fell from a height and presented with abdominal pain, distension, tachycardia, and oliguria.
 This report set the stage for routine splenectomy, which was performed for all splenic injury in the next two generations.
 Despite early reports by Pearce and by Morris and Bullock that splenectomy in animals caused impaired defenses against infection, little challenge to routine splenectomy was made until King and Schumacker in 1952 reported a syndrome of ""overwhelming postsplenectomy infection"" (OPSI).
 Many studies have since demonstrated the importance of the spleen in preventing infections, particularly from the encapsulated organisms.
 Overwhelming postsplenectomy infection occurs in about 0.6% of children and 0.3% of adults.
 Intraoperative splenic salvage has become more popular and can be achieved safely in most patients by delivering the spleen with the pancreas to the incision, carefully repairing the spleen under direct vision, and using the many adjuncts to suture repair, including hemostatic agents and splenic wrapping.
 Intraoperative splenic salvage is not indicated in patients actively bleeding from other organs or in the presence of alcoholic cirrhosis.
 The role of splenic replantation in those patients requiring operative splenectomy needs further study but may provide significant long-term splenic function.
 Although nonoperative splenic salvage was first suggested more than 100 years ago by Billroth, this modality did not become popular in children until the 1960s or in adults until the latter 1980s.
 Patients with intrasplenic hematomas or with splenic fractures that do not extend to the hilum as judged by computed tomography usually can be observed successfully without operative intervention and without blood transfusion.
 Nonoperative splenic salvage is less likely with fractures that involve the splenic hilum and with the severely shattered spleen; these patients usually are treated best by early operative intervention.
 Following splenectomy for injury, polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine decreases the likelihood of OPSI and should be used routinely.
 The role of prophylactic penicillin is uncertain but the use of antibiotics for minor infectious problems is indicated after splenectomy.

 The large difference in potency between i.m.

 administration for NMDA and for CGS 19755, as well as the slower onset of catalepsy when CGS 19755 was administered i.m., suggests these compounds do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier when administered parenterally.
 The inability of CGS 19755 to attenuate the rate-decreasing effects of NMDA when CGS 19755 or NMDA was administered i.c.v.
 suggests NMDA might decrease responding by different mechanisms when administered i.m.

 in pigeons.
 Together these results indicate antagonism of NMDA in this study, and perhaps in other studies, when both NMDA and CGS 19755 were administered parenterally, might result from a peripherally mediated interaction.
 Moreover, this agonist-antagonist interaction is not a simple, competitive antagonism.

1101,"Renal vein renins: inability to predict response to revascularization in patients with hypertension.
 To determine whether the captopril-stimulated renal vein renin ratio (CSRVRR) could enable identification of patients with hemodynamically significant renovascular lesions who would respond to revascularization, the authors measured CSRVRRs in 143 consecutive patients with hypertension who had been selected because of clinical features suggestive of renovascular hypertension.
 All patients underwent conventional renal arteriography.
 Renovascular hypertension was the final diagnosis if revascularization resulted in cure or improvement in blood pressure.
 Complete data were available for 133 patients.
 Twenty patients had renovascular hypertension; CSRVRR was greater than 1.5 in 13 of these 20 patients (sensitivity, 65%).
 However, it was also greater than 1.5 in 54 of the 113 patients without renovascular hypertension (false-positive rate, 47.8%).
 The positive predictive value of CSRVRR was 18.6%; the negative predictive value, 89.3%.
 It is concluded that CSRVRR is not sufficiently sensitive to enable prediction of which patients will respond to revascularization and is not specific enough to exclude patients who do not have renovascular hypertension.

 Injuries to front seat occupants in tow-away crashes in the Charlottesville, Va, area were compared for 1 year before and 1 year after Virginia's seat belt use law took effect.
 Vehicle and occupant data were combined to examine crash and injury patterns.
 Reported seat belt use in crashes increased after the law, and there were substantial decreases in injuries.
 Front seat occupants were less likely to receive medical treatment following a crash in the postlaw period.
 The reduction in the number of injuries was greater for passengers in the right front seat than for drivers and for frontal crashes than for other types of crashes.
 The injury reduction effects occurred primarily through reductions in the number of head and face injuries, particularly those that occur from contact with windshields and instrument panels.

 STUDY OBJECTIVE: Animal studies suggest that the standard dose of epinephrine (SDE) for treatment of cardiac arrest in human beings may be too low.
 We compared the outcome after SDE with that after high-dose epinephrine (HDE) in children with refractory cardiac arrest.
 DESIGN: Prospective intervention versus historic control groups.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Two similar groups of 20 consecutive patients each (median ages, 2.5 and 3 years) with witnessed cardiac arrest who remained in arrest after at least two SDEs (0.01 mg/kg).
 INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with an additional SDE versus HDE (0.2 mg/kg).
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The rates of return of spontaneous circulation and long-term survival were compared.
 Fourteen of the HDE group (70%) had return of spontaneous circulation, whereas none of the SDE group did (P less than .001).
 Eight children survived to discharge after HDE, and three were neurologically intact at follow-up.
 No significant toxicity from HDE was observed.
 CONCLUSION: HDE provided a higher return of spontaneous circulation rate and a better long-term outcome than SDE in our series of pediatric cardiac arrest.
 HDE may warrant incorporation into standard resuscitation protocols at an early enough point to prevent irreversible brain injury.

 Doses of beta-carotene for cancer-prevention trials have been chosen based on epidemiologic data.
 Mechanisms of the putative antineoplastic effects by beta-carotene are unknown but may involve modulation of the immune system.
 We measured plasma carotenoid concentrations and selected immunologic indices at baseline and at 2 and 4 wk in 50 healthy humans (5 groups of 10 each) ingesting 0, 15, 45, 180, or 300 mg beta-carotene/d for 1 mo in this randomized placebo-controlled, open-label, parallel study.
 Plasma beta-carotene concentrations were markedly increased by 2 wk and were correlated with dose.
 Beta-carotene concentrations plateaued between 2 and 4 wk except for the 300-mg group.
 Thus, we developed a dose-concentration curve to optimize beta-carotene-dose selection to achieve target plasma concentrations.
 We were unable to identify any effects of beta-carotene ingestion on the immunologic indices studied, but modest increases in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol were observed in all beta-carotene-treated groups.

 Abnormal blood rheology is a known characteristics of coronary artery disease.
 The authors evaluated the effects of pentoxifylline on the exercise capacity ejection fraction and symptoms of 9 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
 All patients had signs and symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction.
 All had at least two major vessels obstructed as determined by coronary angiography.
 Pentoxifylline 400 mg three times daily was administered for twelve weeks.
 Seven of 9 patients responded with increases in ejection fraction and exercise tolerance.
 Exercise tolerance correlated with improvement or lack of improvement in ejection fraction.
 For all patients at twelve weeks post-therapy mean ejection fraction increased 9.8% over baseline (p = .07), total treadmill time increased 15% (p = .27), and mean double product increased 13% (p = .03).
 Anginal symptoms were significantly improved over baseline at twelve weeks of therapy (p greater than .001), as well as dyspnea on exertion (p = .03).
 Pentoxifylline was well tolerated.
 Pentoxifylline may benefit ischemic cardiomyopathy by improving coronary perfusion owing to favorable alterations in hemorheologic properties.

 The authors propose that pH buffering of bupivicaine with sodium bicarbonate reduces the pain associated with its local subcutaneous infiltration.
 In a double-blind, prospective study, 62 healthy adult volunteers received a 0.5 mL subcutaneous infiltration of 0.5% buffered bupivicaine into the dorsum of a randomly chosen hand.
 The pH was adjusted to 7.0 by adding 0.05 mL of sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/L [corrected]) to 10 mL vials of commercially available bupivicaine (1:200 dilution).
 The control hand was injected with the same amount of unbuffered agent.
 Pain was scored after each infiltration using a nonsegmented visual analogue scale.
 Student's t-test for paired measurements was used to analyze intergroup pain score differences.
 Forty-three subjects (69%) reported less pain with buffered bupivicaine and only 17 (27%) noted a modest increase: two subjects (3%) reported no difference.
 The mean pain score for the buffered agent was 22 mm compared with 30 mm for the control.
 The mean difference (control-experimental) was 8 mm (t = 4.64, df = 61, P less than .001).
 The authors conclude that the addition of sodium bicarbonate to bupivicaine reduces the pain associated with its local infiltration.

 This is the first report on the photodynamic treatment with a second-generation sensitizer, chloro-aluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine (CASPc) of spontaneously arising tumors and on the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of snake neoplasms.
 Each of 10 cats, 2 dogs, and 3 snakes presenting with a variety of tumor types (squamous cell carcinoma, mast cell malignant tumor, and mixed carcinoma/sarcoma) was given an intravenous injection of 1 mg of CASPc per kilogram body weight 48 hours prior to irradiation with 675-nm light.
 Some larger tumors (greater than 1.5 cm deep) were surgically debulked prior to PDT.
 No significant systemic toxicity or skin photosensitization was observed in any animal.
 The tumor responses were comparable to those seen with conventional cryotherapy, hyperthermia, or surgery.
 PDT with CASPc of these cases led to 67% (12 of 18) complete response, 22% (4 of 18) partial response, and 11% (2 of 18) no response (less than 50% reduction in tumor size).
 Four cases could not be evaluated.
 Since the overall tumor response to CASPc is very good, and the problem of skin photosensitivity is nonexistent, it is expected that using CASPc-PDT to eradicate human tumors would also yield comparable results.
 Further studies with long-term follow-up are necessary to optimize the use of CASPc-PDT in veterinary and human medicine.

 In an in vitro experiment using fresh human lumbar functional spinal units, the effects of the division of the posterior ligaments (consisting of the supraspinous/interspinous ligaments) and graded facetectomies were investigated.
 The graded facetectomies consisted of unilateral and bilateral medial facetectomies, and unilateral and bilateral total facetectomies.
 Six kinds of moments were applied and ranges of motion (ROM) and neutral zones (NZ) were determined three-dimensionally by stereophotogrammetric methods.
 Range of motion was not affected by the division of the supraspinous/interspinous ligaments for all load modes.
 In flexion, ROM increased slightly after unilateral medial facetectomy.
 In right axial rotation, ROM increased after left unilateral total facetectomy.
 Range of motion was not affected, even by bilateral total facetectomies, in extension and lateral bendings.
 This study suggested that medial facetectomy does not affect lumbar spinal stability, and conversely, total facetectomy, even created unilaterally, makes the lumbar spine unstable.

 BACKGROUND.
 Longitudinal studies of adult drinking have typically excluded or sampled only small numbers of problem drinking women, and have measured a limited range of influences on women's drinking behavior.
 METHODS.
 To study the development of women's problem drinking over time, five-year follow-up interviews were conducted with two groups of respondents from a 1981 national survey of women's drinking: 143 problem drinkers and 157 nonproblem drinkers.
 Regression analyses examined effects of 1981 predictors on six measures of 1986 problem drinking, for problem drinkers and nonproblem drinkers separately.
 RESULTS.
 Among 1981 nonproblem drinkers, predictors of onset of problem drinking indicators by 1986 included younger age, cohabiting, and lifetime use of drugs other than alcohol.
 The most consistent predictor of persistent (chronic) problem drinking was sexual dysfunction; other predictor included being employed part-time or never married, and experiencing recent depression.
 Divorce or separation predicted lower levels of subsequent alcohol dependance among problem drinkers.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Findings suggest that different personal and social factors predict the onset of problem drinking as compared with its continuation, and point to nontraditional life-style, sexual dysfunction, and role deprivation as potentially important variables.

 Doxazosin produced significantly greater mean reductions in standing (p = 0.01) and supine (p = 0.04) DBP than did prazosin; there were no significant between-group differences in either mean systolic blood pressure or heart rate.
 The overall mean daily doses for efficacy-evaluable patients were 4.7 mg of doxazosin and 6.7 mg of prazosin.
 Sixteen patients (84.2%) treated with doxazosin and 13 patients (56.5%) treated with prazosin were considered therapeutic successes (decrease in standing DBP greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg or to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg with greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg reduction from baseline).
 Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with doxazosin, 15 (78.9%) showed improvement in the severity category of hypertension; an improvement in severity was reported in 14 patients (60.9%) treated with prazosin.

 All had coronary angiography.
 Noncardiac side effects (26%), induced chest discomfort (44%), and ST segment changes (12%) were similar in the two groups.

 Two patients had prolonged chest pain, both with extensive reversible image abnormalities and associated creatinine kinase-MB release.
 Both had elective bypass surgery.
 Twenty-eight patients had normal coronary arteries, and 35 had single-vessel disease.
 Scintigraphic per patient sensitivity and specificity were 91% and 79% with a per vessel sensitivity of 74% and a per vessel specificity of 78% without between-group differences.
 During a brief follow-up period, 62 patients with image abnormalities had coronary revascularization, and there were seven deaths without intergroup differences.
 In a similar patient group that did not have angiography, scintigraphic defects were less frequent and less extensive, revascularization was not performed, and subsequent deaths occurred less often.
 Dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy is an accurate alternative to exercise testing in the evaluation of patients with unstable angina pectoris.
 Although not without risk, the method appears relatively safe and should be considered as a guide to diagnosis, and probably to prognosis and management.

 Tumour suppressor genes, whose usual function seems to be controlling normal cell proliferation, have been implicated in many inherited and sporadic forms of malignancies Much evidence supports the concept of tumour formation by loss-of-function mutations in suppressor genes, as predicted by the two-hit model of Knudson and DeMars.
 The suppressor gene, p53, is affected in such a manner by numerous mutations, which occur in a variety of human tumours.
 These mutations usually represent the loss of one allele and the substitution of a single base in the other.
 We have now analysed the p53 gene in a family affected by Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by the occurrence of diverse mesenchymal and epithelial neoplasms at multiple sites.
 In some instances the neoplasms seem to be related to exposure to carcinogens, including ionizing radiation.
 The Li-Fraumeni family that we studied had noncancerous skin fibroblasts (NSF) with an unusual radiation-resistant phenotype.
 DNA derived from the NSF cells of four family members, spanning two generations, had the same point mutation in codon 245 (GGC----GAC) of the p53 gene.
 This mutation leads to substitution of aspartic acid for glycine in one of the regions identified as a frequent target of point mutations in p53.
 The NSF cell lines with the mutation also retained the normal p53 allele.
 This inherited p53 mutation may predispose the members of this family to increased susceptibility to cancer.

 We have investigated the effect of PGE on tumor-host interaction by utilizing a parenterally administered long-acting PGE derivative, 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin E (dPGE).
 Administration of dPGE was found to decrease the rate of tumor growth but at a cost of decreasing tumor-free body mass.

 Metastases are common (82%), primarily to the lung and liver.
 Aggressive surgical resection and adjuvant radiation therapy, including intraoperative radiation therapy, are recommended.
 Adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered, although its benefits at present are unclear.

1134,"Nasal augmentation with split calvarial grafts in Orientals.
 This study reports on my experience with autogenous split calvarial grafts in nasal augmentation in 62 Orientals.
 In 78 percent of patients, the procedure was performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting.
 Total operating time for harvesting of split calvarial grafts ranged from 20 to 55 minutes, with a mean of 32 minutes.
 Patients ranged in age from 16 to 48 years, with a mean of 27 years.
 Follow-up was from 6 months to 8 years, with an average of 3.1 years.
 Intraoperative discomfort was uniformly low and well tolerated when local anesthesia was used.
 The complication rate was 8.0 percent, with three cases of minor seroma-hematoma formation at the bone-graft donor site.
 These were treated with aspiration.
 There were two recipient-site complications, with one case of complete bone resorption that occurred in a densely fibrotic nose with preexisting septal perforation and a case of overcorrection that was successfully rasped 1 year later.
 Because of their easy accessibility beneath the scalp, split calvarial grafts to the nose are useful in various types of nasal augmentation, and the technique is offered as a practical alternative to the use of alloplastic materials.

 Cervical facet dislocations may be reduced rapidly and effectively using axial traction with weights applied at over the traditional 45-pound limit.
 Fifty-three sequential patients with cervical facet dislocations were reviewed.
 Thirty-nine patients required more than 50 pounds of traction to achieve rapid reduction.
 Sixty-eight percent of the entire series showed significant improvement in neurologic function.
 There were no cases of significant loss of function.
 A cadaver study confirmed that the cranial tongs could support over 100 pounds of traction.
 Careful application of up to 100 pounds seems to be associated with a low risk of neurologic compromise or tong failure, but results in effective reduction of dislocations.

1136,"Poloxamer 407 as an intraperitoneal barrier material for the prevention of postsurgical adhesion formation and reformation in rodent models for reproductive surgery.
 Comtemporary adhesion-prevention regimens for infertility surgery emphasize the use of barrier materials to effect physical separation of injured surfaces before reperitonealization.
 Poloxamer 407 is a biocompatible polymer that displays reverse thermal gelation characteristics; that is, the material exists as a liquid at room temperature and as a solid at body temperature.
 These properties make it an ideal material for use in laparoscopic surgery.
 The antiadhesion properties of poloxamer 407 were evaluated in two models.
 In the first experiment, Golden hamsters were subjected to a standardized adhesion-producing lesion in the left uterine horn.
 Poloxamer solutions in concentrations ranging from 15-35% were applied to the injured horn.
 Location, thickness, and extent of adhesion formation were assessed 14 days later.
 Significant reduction in post-traumatic adhesion formation was observed following treatment with the 30-35% solutions.
 The second experiment was designed as a paradigm of the typical situation encountered in infertility surgery: prevention of adhesion reformation after lysis of established adhesions.
 New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to three laparotomies at 14-day intervals for placement of the adhesion-producing lesion, evaluation (prescore) and surgical lysis of induced adhesions, and subsequent evaluation of adhesion reformation (post-score).
 The effect of applying poloxamer 407 after adhesiotomy was compared with controls (no treatment).
 Adhesion reformation (post-score) was markedly reduced by poloxamer-407 treatment.
 Further trials of this material in the clinical setting are indicated.

 Of 20 patients suffering trauma, with Injury Severity Scores greater than 20, 11 patients received DL-3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) at a rate of 25 mumol/kg/min for 3 hours.
 The remaining nine patients received sodium DL-lactate at the same rate as the control subjects.
 With increased arterial concentrations of ketone bodies, the femoral arteriovenous difference (arterial concentration minus venous concentration) of ketone bodies increased proportionally in the 3-OHB group (R = 0.853, p less than 0.001).
 Venous concentrations of nonesterified free fatty acids, alanine, glycine, and valine were decreased significantly in the 3-OHB group as compared to the control group.
 The concentration difference between femoral vein and artery (venous concentration minus arterial concentration) for these substrates also decreased, indicating decreased release from the extremity.
 A decrease in venous concentration of alanine and difference between femoral vein and artery reached 102.3 +/- 69.3 mumol/L and 32.6 +/- 22.8 mumol/L (mean +/- SD), respectively, after 3-OHB infusion.
 Decreased alanine release from muscle during 3-OHB infusion in traumatized patients suggests a suppressive effect of ketone body on posttraumatic protein catabolism.

 Polyglycolic acid mesh has been introduced as a method of controlling hemorrhage in severely damaged spleens.
 This study examines the effect of splenic wrapping on the immune function of the spleen, and also on its ability to control splenic bleeding in trauma patients.
 Thirty purebred beagle dogs were divided into three groups and subjected to sham operation (Group 1), splenectomy (Group 2), and splenic wrap (Group 3).
 Immunologic studies showed no difference between the wrapped group (Group 3) and those with their spleens intact (Group 1) in the induction of specific antibody-producing lymphocytes in splenic tissue after the injection of attenuated Pneumococci.
 All splenic injuries treated at Cook County Hospital between January 1985 and May 1988 were retrospectively analyzed.
 Of 60 patients with splenic injuries, 14 underwent mesh splenorrhaphy without mortality or serious complications.
 This study demonstrates that the immune function of spleen is preserved following mesh splenorrhapy, and that this technique can be used in a clinical setting with safe and efficacious results.

 Uniform standards for evaluating and reporting the results of therapeutic interventions for peripheral vascular disease are clearly needed.
 They are already established for vascular surgery, as represented by several reports by SVS/ISCVS committees, but they are not always followed by vascular surgeons and have been largely ignored by other vascular interventionists.
 In this article, the major problematic reporting practices are discussed and illustrated, and 14 recommendations are advanced to deal with them.
 They are intended to provide precise definitions, objective criteria of success or failure, standardized severity gradation schemes for peripheral vascular disease and its risk factors, and proper procedures for reporting the outcome of all forms of therapeutic intervention.
 Until these or some other agreed upon reporting standards are accepted and followed, the literature on peripheral vascular disease and its management will continue to be a source of confusion rather than enlightenment.

1143,"Single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography in cancer imaging.
 Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are now being used to improve the information available from radioisotopic imaging of patients with cancer.
 These nuclear medicine techniques offer the potential for studying regional function and biochemistry by using radiolabeled substrates.
 The chemical changes of malignancy precede anatomic changes, and PET and/or SPECT may detect these changes before anatomic changes have occurred.
 The superiority of SPECT compared with planar imaging has been demonstrated for cardiac and brain imaging.
 Radiopharmaceuticals containing technetium 99 m (99mTc) are best suited for SPECT imaging because large amounts of radioactivity are administered and the collimator-camera systems are optimized for the 140 keV photons of 99mTc.
 The current interest in imaging cancer with SPECT relates to the use of gallium 67 citrate and monoclonal antibodies labeled with iodine 123 or indium 111.
 SPECT can image these radioisotopes, but the advantages compared with planar imaging have not been clearly defined.
 Furthermore, the ability to quantitate the distribution of single photon emitters other than 99mTc has not been demonstrated.
 New SPECT systems with three heads or rings of detectors offer promise for improved, quantitative imaging.
 PET has the capability of imaging tracers with the biologically important elements C-11, N-13, O-15, and F-18 used for positron labeling.
 These radioisotopes have short half-lives and require a cyclotron close to the PET facility.
 The most prominently used radiopharmaceutical for PET is F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).
 PET studies with FDG in patients with primary brain tumors have demonstrated the ability to determine the degree of malignancy, to differentiate necrosis from recurrent tumor after radiation therapy or chemotherapy, and to predict prognosis.
 Other metabolic functions of cancer have been studied, including amino acid accumulation, thymidine uptake, oxygen utilization, intermediary metabolism, and receptor status.
 PET has the potential to make a major impact on the characterization of a malignancy and the effect of therapy.

 Previous studies have shown that essential hypertension is frequently associated with insulin resistance.
 The tissues responsible for this metabolic alteration have not been defined.
 We tested the hypothesis that skeletal muscle is the site of insulin resistance of essential hypertension with the use of the perfused forearm technique.
 Eight hypertensive (age 42 +/- 3 years, body mass index 27 +/- 1 kg/m2, intra-arterial mean blood pressure 126 +/- 4 mm Hg) and seven normotensive (age 48 +/- 3 years, body mass index 26 +/- 1 kg/m2, mean blood pressure 95 +/- 4 mm Hg) male volunteers were studied.
 After glucose ingestion (40 g/m2), normal glucose tolerance in the patients was maintained at the expense of a heightened plasma insulin response, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance.
 During graded, local (intra-arterial) hyperinsulinemia encompassing the physiological range (12-120 milliunits/l), glucose uptake by forearm tissues was significantly (p less than 0.03) reduced in the hypertensive subjects as compared with the controls at each of five insulin steps, by 43% on the average.
 In addition, forearm lactate and pyruvate release were significantly less stimulated in the hypertensive than in the normotensive group (p less than 0.01 for both), presumably as a consequence of the decreased glucose influx.
 Forearm exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, lipid substrates (free fatty acids, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate), and potassium were similar in the hypertensive and normotensive groups in the basal state.
 Insulin had no effect on oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and respiratory quotient in either study group, whereas it stimulated free fatty acids, glycerol, and potassium uptake to the same extent in the hypertensive and normotensive groups.

1147,"Evolution of energy expenditure and nitrogen excretion in severe head-injured patients.
 OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of therapeutic changes on the level of energy expenditure (EE) and N excretion in a homogeneous group of patients usually considered hypermetabolic.
 DESIGN: EE and N excretion of head-injured patients were measured simultaneously at phases 1 and 2 (patients treated 4 +/- 3 and 18 +/- 8 days after injury, respectively).
 SETTING: Acute care hospital.
 PATIENTS: Eight severe head-injured patients, mean weight 63.1 +/- 6.1 (SD) kg, mean age 21 +/- 3.8 (SD) yr.
 INTERVENTIONS: At phase 1, all patients were sedated with fentanyl (6.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/kg.hr) plus flunitrazepam (9.1 +/- 4.8 micrograms/kg.hr) and were mechanically ventilated.
 All patients received continuous total parenteral nutrition.
 The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1092 +/- 200 kcal/day, including 77% glucose and 23% fat (Intralipid 20%).
 The total N intake averaged 7 +/- 5 g/day, consisting of crystalline amino acids.
 At phase 2, no patient received any sedative and all were breathing spontaneously via tracheostomy.
 All patients received parenteral and/or enteral nutrition.
 The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1929 +/- 200 kcal/day consisting of 65% carbohydrates and 35% fat.
 The total N intake averaged 13 +/- 2 g/day.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The EE was significantly higher at phase 2 than at phase 1 (2121 vs.
 1737 kcal), but the interindividual variability was low at both phases.
 N excretion was high at the two periods of the study and not correlated to the level of EE.
 The RQ was 0.75 at both periods, indicating predominant fat oxidation.
 CONCLUSIONS: We could not demonstrate any parallelism in the evolution of EE and protein catabolism in head-injured patients.
 The therapeutics (mechanical ventilation, sedation, and nutrition) have a major effect on EE but little on N excretion.

1149,"Localization of technetium-99m-glucarate in zones of acute cerebral injury.
 The potential structural similarity of technetium-99m-labeled glucaric acid (99mTc-glucarate) to that of fructose suggests that this agent may enter cells by a sugar transport system.
 Studies with LLC-PK1 cells demonstrated inhibition of 99mTc-glucarate uptake by fructose, confirming this potential relationship.
 Since anaerobic metabolism can use either glucose or fructose, we hypothesized that 99mTc-glucarate may concentrate in areas of acute ischemic injury.
 To test this hypothesis, 63 adult rats with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by reperfusion were injected with 99mTc-glucarate and in vivo and ex vivo images were acquired.
 Seven animals were also studied with 18FDG and high resolution PET imaging.
 The radionuclide images were compared to the results of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and conventional histopathology.
 Thirty-five rats had significant accumulation of 99mTc-glucarate and no TTC staining (indicating infarction) in the involved hemisphere.
 Of the remaining 28 rats with TTC staining (suggesting viability) of the involved hemisphere, 16 (57%) had 99mTc-glucarate accumulation.
 In the seven rats that were studied with both 99mTc-glucarate and 18FDG, 99mTc-glucarate accumulated at the center of the occluded MCA territory while 18FDG activity was decreased in this region.
 These results suggest that 99mTc-glucarate is a sensitive marker of acute severe cerebral injury, but its mechanism of localization is probably different from that of 18FDG.

 After 12 weeks, 78.8% of efficacy-evaluable patients were considered therapy successes (sitting diastolic blood pressure either less than or equal to 90 mm Hg with greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg reduction from baseline or greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg reduction from baseline).
 The mean daily dose in patients considered a therapy success was 2.8 mg.
 By the final visit, sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressures of these patients were reduced by 16.4/13.5 mm Hg from a mean baseline of 170/106 mm Hg.
 The investigators' global assessment of efficacy of once-daily doxazosin therapy was excellent or good for 70% of patients.
 Of the 326 patients, 30.7% reported a total of 160 side effects; 78% of the side effects were mild or moderate in severity, and 24 patients (7.4%) discontinued treatment because of adverse experiences.
 The investigators' global assessment of toleration was excellent or good for 87% of patients.

 The antiischemic properties of nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, were assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial by repeated exercise testing and 72-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in 82 patients with coronary artery disease.
 Patients with positive treadmill stress test results and greater than or equal to 2 ischemic episodes per 24 hours were included in this study.
 Administration of all chronic antiischemic medications except beta blockers were discontinued.
 During the first week all patients received placebo twice daily.
 During the second and third weeks, 41 patients received nisoldipine 10 mg and 41 patients received placebo twice daily.
 In the placebo group there were no changes in exercise parameters or in ambulatory electrocardiographic parameters.
 In the nisoldipine group, exercise duration increased from 403 to 448 seconds (p = 0.0035), time to 1 mm of ST depression increased from 224 to 298 seconds (p = 0.002), time to pain increased from 241 to 321 seconds (p = 0.01), and maximal ST depression was reduced from 2.6 to 2.3 mm (p = 0.002).
 Among the ambulatory electrocardiographic parameters in the nisoldipine group, only the number of episodes was reduced, from 14.4 to 11.6 (p = 0.0013) per patient.

 In- and outpatients from two Milwaukee area substance abuse treatment hospitals, and a number of their collaterals, participated in this study.
 Patients' and collaterals' responses on the AAAI and the SAAST were compared through the use of a paired t test.
 Results indicated no significant differences between patients' self-reports compared with collateral reports, and demonstrated a direct relationship on the AAAI (two tailed p less than 0.001) and SAAST (two-tailed p less than 0.001).
 Self-reports of patients who volunteered collaterals compared with self-reports of patients who did not volunteer collaterals also showed no significant differences on the AAAI or the SAAST, demonstrating consistency of reporting whether the patients believed their reports would be compared with information provided by a collateral or not.

1154,"Heat illness. Fluid and electrolyte issues for pediatric and adolescent athletes.
 The primary mechanism for maintaining normal body temperature during physical exercise in the heat is the evaporation of sweat.
 With profuse sweating, water loss far exceeds electrolyte loss.
 Rigorous exercise in the heat places the athlete at risk for thermoregulatory dysfunction from dehydration.
 Because children are inherently less efficient thermoregulators than adults, they are at even greater risk for heat illness.
 The three primary syndromes of heat illness are heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.
 Treatment of heat illness is based on reduction of body temperature and rehydration.
 Heat stroke is a true medical emergency with a high mortality rate; immediate reduction of body temperature is critical to the survival of these patients.
 Prevention of heat illness is based on reducing known risk factors.
 Physical activity should be modified in the face of high ambient temperature and humidity.
 The athlete should begin exercise well hydrated; frequent consumption of cold water during exercise decreases likelihood of significant dehydration.
 After exercise, the athlete should continue drinking to replace fluid losses.
 Clothing should be lightweight; the more skin exposed, the greater the available evaporative surface.
 A preseason conditioning program, when combined with an 8- to 14-day period of acclimatization, further reduces the risk of heat injury.
 Although athletes engaged in endurance sports may benefit from drinking carbohydrate/electrolyte-containing solutions, for the majority of young athletes, cold water remains the preferred choice for fluid replacement during exercise.
 The relatively greater body surface area of young athletes also places them at risk for hypothermia.
 Special attention should be given when these athletes are competing under cold environmental conditions.

 The initial survey for this study was done in 1952.
 Follow-up surveys of respondents were done in 1960, 1968, 1976, and 1984.
 The present study used all subjects who responded fully to activity and health questions in 1976 and who were reported as either dead or alive (not lost to follow-up) in 1984.
 A total of 348 subjects (185 ATH, 163 N-ATH) were assessed and caloric expenditure groups were established by kilocalories (kcal) of aerobic exercise per week; 0 kcal (group 1), 1-399 kcal (group 2), 400-899 kcal (group 3), 900-1499 kcal (group 4), 1500-2499 kcal (group 5), and 2500+ kcal (group 6).
 Only activity considered to be aerobic was used in the establishment of the aerobic categories.

 In this study, double-labeling immunohistochemistry was used to gain insight into the coexpression or interrelationship between blood group antigens (BGA) that are differentiation antigens in the normal colon, and BGA that are sequential moieties in the same synthetic pathway.
 Paired-wise Sialylated-Le(a)/Le(y) and H-2/Le(y) was studied.
 The Sialylated-Le(a) and Le(y) are synthesized from type 1 and type 2 backbones, respectively.
 In the normal colon, the Le(y) and Sialylated-Le(a) are expressed by cells at the base and surface of the crypt, respectively, representing undifferentiated and differentiated enterocytes.
 The H-2 is considered oncofetal in nature, and is considered to be the immediate precursor in the synthesis of Le(y).
 In individual cancers.
 Sialylated-Lea and Le(y) were detected in different cancer cells within the same malignant glands, separately in different glands, and in different subcellular compartments of the same cell.
 Both H-2 and Le(y) were coexpressed in the same individual cells in 92% of cancers expressing both these BGA.
 In 50% of the cancers, the H-2 and Le(y) also were expressed separately in different malignant glands within individual tumors.
 These findings indicate that, in colorectal cancers, differentiation antigens (Sialylated Le(a) and Le(y)) are expressed by different individual cells within the same malignant gland somewhat, recapitulating the normal colon crypt.
 Antigens of different backbones occasionally may be expressed in the same cells but within different subcellular compartments.
 Precursor accumulation is common in cancers, and antigens in the same synthetic pathway are coexpressed in the same cell.
 The expression of H-2 and Le(y) in different glands (lack of coexpression) may be explained possibly by aberrant synthesis of Le(y) by an alternate pathway.

1157,"Task-dependent variations in parkinsonian motor impairments.
 Studies of visually-guided arm movements in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have suggested a relationship between slowness of movement and a reduction in the ratio of movement amplitude and peak velocity.
 Recent studies indicate, however, that PD impairments may be different for well-learned, natural movements performed without visual guidance, or movements associated with sequential motor behaviours such as speech.
 To address this issue, PD subjects and age/sex-matched controls were compared on the performance of three tasks, all of which required lowering the jaw: (1) single, rapid, visually-guided movements; (2) equivalent movements associated with a single speech syllable (inherently without visual guidance), and (3) well-learned speech movements produced in a natural sequence.
 PD subjects manifested similar deficits for visually-guided jaw lowering as those previously reported for arm movements, namely reduced velocity/amplitude ratios and increased movement durations.
 By contrast, analogous jaw movements during the sequential speech tasks were unimpaired on these measures.
 These results suggest that PD motor impairments are influenced by a variety of factors, including the degree to which tasks are familiar and natural, and the availability of visual information.

 Severe trauma favors the susceptibility of patients to infection.
 It has been shown that proteins or protein fragments are responsible for an endogenous immunodepression.
 After trauma a coagulopathy accompanied by increased serum levels of fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) is often found.
 Therefore, we examined whether FDP-D can influence the activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN).
 PMN-activation was measured by two different superoxide-specific methods (Cytochrome-C-test, INT-test).
 With both methods we found a decrease of PMN activity by FDP-D compared to fibrinogen.
 Albumin, which was used as a control protein, only influenced PMN activity in unphysiologically high concentrations.
 The third method used to quantify PMN activity was chemiluminescence, which is a more unspecific method since it is developed not only by oxygen radical species but also by activating the lipoxygenase pathway.
 In contrast to the superoxide specific tests we found an inhibitory effect of fibrinogen and also serum compared to FDP-D using chemiluminescence.

 Furthermore, reflex bradycardia was unaffected in either rat strain, but reflex tachycardia was selectively suppressed in Fischer 344 rats.
 Thus, although time controls were not done to rule out spontaneous changes during the 14-day infusion period, these results suggest that central cardiovascular regulation does not change similarly with age in these two rat strains.
 As removal of the brain renin-angiotensin system lowered blood pressure in one strain and inhibited reflex tachycardia in the other, the divergence could mean that the brain renin-angiotensin system acts differently to keep blood pressure elevated in Sprague-Dawley rats and modulate reflex tachycardia in Fischer 344 rats.

1160,"Relationship of clinical features with psychological status in primary fibromyalgia.
 Clinical features and psychological status determined by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in 103 patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) were analyzed by univariate and multivariate techniques to determine if clinical features were related to psychological status or were intrinsic to PFS per se.
 The central features of PFS, e.g., number of pain sites, number of tender points, fatigue, and poor sleep, were independent of psychological status.
 However, discriminant analysis identified 4 variables--patient-reported depression, anxiety, stress, and pain severity--which together predicted 3 MMPI subgroups with an accuracy of 55% (P less than 0.001); the only musculoskeletal feature--pain severity--alone provided an accuracy of only 34% (P greater than 0.05).
 These data suggest a new concept, that the central features of fibromyalgia are independent of the psychological status and are more likely related to the PFS itself.
 However, pain severity may be influenced by psychological factors.

1161,"Comparison of pre- and postoperative conduction patterns in patients surgically cured of atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia.
 Patients with atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia characteristically have short and constant retrograde His-atrium conduction times (H2A2 intervals) during the introduction of ventricular extrastimuli.
 It has therefore been suggested that the tachycardia circuit involves retrograde conduction up an accessory pathway located in perinodal tissue.
 If the mechanism of surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is interruption of this accessory pathway, postoperative changes in retrograde conduction would be expected.
 Thirteen patients with drug-refractory AV node reentrant tachycardia underwent surgery.
 Preoperatively, H2A2 intervals were short and constant.
 During AV node reentrant tachycardia, earliest atrial activation was seen near the His bundle and was 0 to 25 ms before ventricular activation in all patients except one.
 Surgery consisted of dissection of right atrial septal and anterior inputs to the AV node and central fibrous body.
 Postoperatively, the H2A2 interval remained short and constant compared with preoperative values although it was slightly prolonged (74 +/- 18 versus 61 +/- 21 ms, p less than 0.005).
 Twelve of the 13 patients are free of tachycardia after 28 +/- 13 months and no patient has had evidence of AV node block.
 Thus, surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is highly successful; however, there is no reason to postulate an accessory pathway or use of perinodal tissue as part of the tachycardia circuit and the mechanism of surgical success remains obscure.

 One hundred forty-five children with seizures that were refractory to medical therapy for at least 2 years were followed 5 to 20 years after onset.
 The majority of children with uncontrollable seizures (61%) were mentally retarded, and most of these (73%) had onset of seizures at younger than 2 years of age.
 Age of onset was significantly later (mean 5.0 +/- 0.5 yr [SEM]) in the group of children with borderline to normal intelligence.
 Follow-up data showed remission of seizures in a significant proportion of children with borderline or normal intelligence, with a linear decrease of the percentage with persistent seizures at a rate of about 4% per year.
 Remission of seizures was much less frequent (1.5%/yr) in the group with mental retardation.

1163,"Etoposide. Current and future status.
 Etoposide (VP-16-213) is an antineoplastic agent with demonstrated efficacy against a broad spectrum of human malignancies, including testicular, germ cell, lung, and other cancers.
 Etoposide can be synergistic with other agents.
 As part of combination chemotherapy, etoposide has become a so-called standard in therapies for testicular cancer and small cell lung cancer.
 Its activity in tumors such as lymphoma and leukemia, as well as solid tumors, identifies etoposide as a highly important chemotherapeutic agent.
 Cellular and animal models have shown that the cell kill and tumor response depend on both dose and time of exposure.
 Recent clinical studies again show that dose and schedule of etoposide can have important effects on clinical response to the drug.
 Further research should now continue: (1) on the use of etoposide as part of initial therapy in several cancers, and (2) in higher doses and prolonged schedules to optimize this agent's potential.

 It is not uncommon for a delay to occur between assessment arteriography and angioplasty attempt.
 We reviewed retrospectively the arteriograms of 61 patients where such a delay occurred to assess progression of superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease in this interval.
 A mean delay of 14.6 days (range 2-60 days) occurred between arteriogram and angioplasty attempt.
 Arteriographic deterioration was found in six of 61 patients (9.8%) and in three this precluded angioplasty.
 Of the six patients four had initial arteriography via the same side as the SFA disease whilst two had arteriography via the contralateral femoral approach.
 We discuss the aetiology of this phenomenon and suggestions are made to reduce its incidence.

 A new method has been developed for recording short-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials after median nerve stimulation.
 Negative electrical forces recorded with three orthodiagonal bipolar electrodes in the neck had a direction opposite to that of impulse conduction in the proximal peripheral and cervical somatosensory pathway.
 Sequential tracings of vectors opposite the electrical forces were made in three-dimensional display, thus reproducing the actual time sequence of electrical events in those structures.
 Fixed generators such as the subcortical nuclei were also analyzed with this technique, and multiple generators of N13 potential (N13a and N13b) were visualized.

 The most important question that had to be answered from our animal data was whether a significant difference existed between the two groups.
 It could be observed that the resuscitation with Ringer's lactate did not lead to any increased lymph flow or total transcapillary protein flow in spite of the drop in protein and oncotic pressure in plasma.
 With Ringer's lactate there was a lower lymph to plasma protein ratio, which might be significant.
 No negative difference could be observed either in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or pulmonary vessel resistance.
 All animals survived throughout the experiment, and in all experiments no advantages regarding the vital parameters could be ascertained with the administration of albumin; however, several factors must be borne in mind.
 The inhalation injury was from a heat source alone and no toxic substances were involved.
 Only inhalation trauma was induced in the absence of a surface burn wound.
 The duration of the observation was for only 36 hours.
 Thus some caution must be observed in applying these findings to a clinical situation.
 In our evaluation of the clinical results, we have seen that no differences could be established in regard to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and extravascular lung water between the Ringer's lactate and the albumin group.
 In spite of a 50% drop in oncotic pressure, however, this is only valid for the first 24 to 36 hours, after which one could assume that a further protein drop coupled with a still raised hydrostatic filtration coefficient would lead to interstitial edema.

 Suicide appears to cluster in families, suggesting that genetic factors may play a role in this behavior.
 We studied 176 twin pairs in which one or both twins had committed suicide.
 Seven of the 62 monozygotic twin pairs were concordant for suicide compared with two of the 114 dizygotic twin pairs (11.3% vs 1.8%).
 The presence of psychiatric disorder in the twins and their families was examined in a subsample of 11 twin pairs, two of whom were concordant for suicide.
 Eleven of these 13 twin suicide victims had been treated for psychiatric disorder, as had eight of their nine surviving cotwins.
 In addition, twins in 10 pairs had other first- or second-degree relatives who had been treated for psychiatric disorder.
 Thus, these twin data suggest that genetic factors related to suicide may largely represent a genetic predisposition for the psychiatric disorders associated with suicide.
 However, they leave open the question of whether there may be an independent genetic component for suicide.

 The unstable hemoglobin Montreal with a deletion of three amino acid residues (Asp, Gly, Leu) at positions 73, 74, and 75 of the beta chain and an insertion of four residues (Ala, Arg, Cys, Gln) at the same location was observed in a 7-year-old Canadian boy suffering from a moderate hemolytic anemia.
 The introduction of an extra amino acid residue and of other changes in the crevice where the heme group is located is the likely cause of the instability of this hemoglobin variant.
 The above listed changes were detected through analyses of tryptic peptides of the beta-Montreal chain, sequencing of amplified DNA, and hybridization of amplified DNA with appropriate, 32P-labeled, oligonucleotide probes.
 It is suggested that a mispairing involving the AGTG sequences at codons 66 and 67 and at codons 72 and 73 of the normal beta gene caused a repetition of a 16-bp segment, while a deletion of 10 nucleotides due to recombination or slippage followed by a second short deletion during DNA repair resulted in the modified sequence of the beta-Montreal gene.

 OBJECTIVE: To present an algorithm for noninvasive measurement of cerebral oxygen saturation (cerebral oximetry) and cerebral hemodynamics with near infrared spectroscopy.
 DESIGN: In vitro correlation of oximetry measurements with reference measurements; illustrative cases of hemodynamic and oximetric recordings.
 SETTING: Tertiary care neuroscience ICU.
 PATIENTS: Brain-injured patients with a prolonged, decreased level of consciousness chosen as illustrative examples.
 INTERVENTIONS: Two-channel multiple wavelength diffuse infrared transmission spectroscopy was interfaced with the scalp using adhesive.
 Transmission data were collected with gross superficial-to-deep spatial resolution.
 Saturation calculation based on the deep signal was observed longitudinally in the patient.
 With the same technology, arterial input and cerebral response functions, generated by iv tracer bolus, were deconvoluted to measure mean cerebral transit time.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A positive linear regression fit between diffuse transmission oximetry and measured blood oxygen saturation over the range 23% to 99% (r2 = .98, p less than .001) was noted.
 CONCLUSIONS: The approach used overcomes previously identified difficulties with cerebral oximetry, and demonstrates excellent in vitro correlation.
 The technique can be performed clinically without difficulty.

1171,"An echocardiographic assessment of atrial mechanical behaviour.
 Relations between movement of the atrioventricular ring and changes in left atrial and ventricular dimensions were studied by echocardiography and compared with apexcardiography and Doppler mitral flow velocity traces in 20 healthy controls and in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 28) or dilatation (n = 16).
 During left ventricular systole the atrioventricular ring, a structure common to ventricle and atrium, moved towards the ventricular apex, thus increasing left atrial volume.
 This action matched pulmonary venous return because it was in phase with the transverse left atrial dimension measured from aortic root to posterior left atrial wall.
 During early diastole, the mitral ring moved rapidly towards the atrium as transmitral flow accelerated.
 This requires a force directed from ventricle to atrium, likely to be the result of elastic recoil arising from compression of the ventricular myocardium or stretching of the atrial myocardium during ventricular systole.
 Two additional mechanisms of ventricular filling with atrial systole were recognised: (a) an increase in ventricular volume as the atrioventricular ring moved upwards and (b) transverse left ventricular expansion by pressure driven transmitral flow.
 The former is undetectable by Doppler from the apex; it accounted for 10% of ventricular filling in the healthy controls, but for significantly less in those with ventricular dilatation.
 In left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular filling was maintained by both mechanisms compensating for the reduced increase in volume early in diastole.
 Interactions between the atrium and ventricle are functionally important during ventricular systole, early diastole, and in atrial systole.
 They are not included in the traditional separation of atrial function into reservoir, conduit, and pump functions.

1172,"Flumazenil: a new benzodiazepine antagonist.
 Flumazenil is a recently discovered pharmacologic antagonist of the CNS effects of benzodiazepines.
 It acts by binding CNS benzodiazepine receptors and competitively blocking benzodiazepine activation of inhibitory GABAergic synapses.
 Animal studies and some human studies appear to demonstrate that flumazenil has weak intrinsic agonist activity; on the other hand, studies are inconclusive in demonstrating any inverse agonist effects of this agent.
 Evidence available suggests that flumazenil is well tolerated in human beings over a broad range of doses when given either orally or parenterally and does not produce serious adverse effects.
 In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine overdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two minutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hours.
 Repeat doses can be given safely to reverse recurrent effects of longer-acting benzodiazepines.
 Flumazenil is undergoing further evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration; should this drug receive approval, it is likely to be used in emergency departments as well as in a variety of other clinical settings.
 First, it could be used to effect rapid reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation that has been administered to facilitate medical, orthopedic, and surgical procedures, particularly in the event of inadvertent respiratory depression.
 Second, flumazenil might have a therapeutic role in the management of patients who have taken benzodiazepine overdoses.
 Although most of these patients can be managed successfully with supportive therapy alone, it is possible that the use of flumazenil may obviate the need for intubation and respiratory support in such patients and eliminate the possible adverse effects of even short-term endotracheal intubation.
 Finally, flumazenil could have both diagnostic and therapeutic value in patients with acute alterations of mental status of unknown etiology, particularly when possible drug overdose is a consideration.
 Because flumazenil appears to be specific in its antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced respiratory and CNS depression, it could be used empirically to confirm or exclude a role of benzodiazepines in the generation of mental status changes in the setting of overdose or coma of unknown origin.
 This in turn might obviate the need for further expensive (eg, computed tomography) and sometimes invasive (eg, lumbar puncture) diagnostic modalities.
 This might be particularly useful because there is nothing about benzodiazepine-induced coma that clearly distinguishes it from other causes of coma; thus, there are no signs or symptoms that may reasonably allow benzodiazepine overdose to be confirmed or eliminated on clinical grounds.
 Further studies will continue to define the ultimate use of this new agent.

 In 35 states drivers submit voluntarily to reevaluation after disabling injuries, but no provision is made for reporting such individuals.
 Only 15 states authorize physicians to report impaired drivers, and only seven require such reporting.
 Based on a survey of licensing bureaus in the capital or a major city of every state, clerks (who are likely to be the source of information to injured persons) are generally not aware of reporting requirements and supervisors are only slightly better informed.
 Of the 100 rehabilitation centers surveyed, only 36 provided on-site training for disabled drivers.
 Voluntary submission for reevaluation after head injury does not often occur.
 Despite being asked to do so, none of the 35 head injured patients, followed up to two years post-onset, sought reevaluation, although 21 had resumed regular driving.
 Two of the 21 were involved in subsequent traffic accidents.

 Mitral valve areas before and after balloon mitral valvuloplasty were serially determined by the Doppler continuity equation method in 16 patients.
 Ultrasound examinations were performed before and immediately after balloon inflation and 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 month after valvuloplasty.
 Mitral valve area determined by the Doppler continuity equation method correlated well with that determined at catheterization by the Gorlin formula, not only before but also immediately after balloon inflation (y = 0.87 x + 0.05, standard error of estimate = 0.22 cm2, r = 0.90).
 Serial calculation of mitral valve area by the Doppler continuity equation method showed a slight but significant decrease in the valve area at 24 hours after balloon mitral valvuloplasty but no change after that.
 We conclude that the Doppler continuity equation method provides an accurate estimation of mitral valve area before and even after balloon valvuloplasty.
 Mitral valve area dilated by balloon inflation is decreased slightly within 24 hours after the procedure, which corroborates valve stretch as one mechanism for increasing mitral valve area with balloon valvuloplasty.
 Estimation of mitral valve area immediately after balloon mitral valvuloplasty may overestimate the long-term efficacy of the procedure.

 We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of valproate, a drug originally developed as an antiepileptic, in 36 patients with acute manic episodes who had previously failed to respond to or to tolerate lithium carbonate.
 Treatment duration was 7 to 21 days, with no other psychotropic medications permitted except lorazepam up to 4 mg/d during the first 10 days of treatment.
 Serum valproate concentrations were measured three times weekly; an unblinded investigator then adjusted dosage to produce serum concentrations between 50 and 100 mg/L.
 Valproate proved superior to placebo in alleviating manic symptoms.
 The 17 patients randomized to active drug demonstrated a median 54% decrease in scores on the Young Mania Rating Scale as compared with a median 5.0% decrease among the 19 patients receiving placebo.
 On the 100-point Global Assessment Scale of overall psychiatric functioning, patients receiving valproate improved by a median of 20 points as compared with a zero-point change with placebo.
 Significant differences also emerged on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and in the number of supplemental doses of lorazepam required by the patients in each group.
 Substantial antimanic effects appeared within 1 to 4 days of achieving therapeutic serum valproate concentrations.
 Adverse effects were infrequent, with no adverse effect appearing significantly more frequently with valproate than with placebo.
 We conclude that valproate represents a useful new drug for the treatment of manic patients.

 Fifty patients without known atrial septal defects undergoing elective cardiovascular surgery were studied.
 A 5-MHz esophageal echocardiographic probe was used to image the fossa ovalis (FO) and 10 ml agitated saline was injected into the right atrium during apnea.
 Echocardiographic contrast was then injected during end-inspiration at 20-cmH2O airway pressure.
 When opacification of the right atrium was complete, the airway pressure was released.
 During these maneuvers, color and pulsed-wave Doppler interrogation of the atrial septum were also performed.
 Right-to-left passage of saline contrast across the interatrial septum was seen in 11 of 50 patients (22%).
 Doppler echocardiography demonstrated a PFO in 2 patients without contrast evidence of shunting.
 Thus, the combination of contrast and Doppler echocardiography identified a 26% (13 of 50) prevalence of PFO, approximating the previously reported autopsy rate of 25%.
 These contrast and Doppler techniques may be useful in detecting patients at risk for paradoxical emboli and in identifying candidates for closure of the PFO.

1177,"Relation between sodium intake, renal function, and the regulation of arterial pressure.
 The long-term regulation of arterial pressure requires the maintenance of a balance between sodium and water intake and sodium and water excretion.
 Normal salt and water balance leads to stable body fluid volumes and the maintenance of normal renal function is critical to establishing extracellular fluid volume homeostasis.
 This review focuses on the role of the kidney in the long-term control of salt and water balance with particular emphasis on the relations between sodium intake, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, renal sympathetic nerve activity, and the regulation of arterial pressure via renal sodium and water excretion.
 The accumulation of evidence in recent years demonstrates that low level elevation of renin release, circulating angiotensin II or aldosterone, or activation of renal sympathetic outflow may alter renal function such that normal natriuretic and diuretic responses to arterial pressure are significantly impeded.
 Under these circumstances, the maintenance of normal sodium and water excretion requires a significant elevation of arterial pressure.
 Thus, compromised renal function leads to elevation of arterial pressure to maintain adequate sodium and water balance during periods of increased sodium intake.
 The resultant chronic elevation of arterial pressure then becomes a compromise that is used by the kidneys to maintain normal extracellular body fluid volumes.

 Each subject's description of how she performed the examination was scored according to her mention of up to 10 recommended BSE techniques.
 A random sample of 433 women without advanced-stage breast cancer from the same population was interviewed for comparison.
 Relative to women not practicing BSE, the risk of advanced-stage breast cancer among BSE users was 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.73-1.81).
 Frequency of BSE did not differ between women with advanced-stage breast cancer and control subjects, whether in all subjects or in subgroups defined by age, use of mammography, or frequency of clinical breast examinations.
 While self-described proficiency in BSE was generally low in both case and control subjects, the small percentage of women reporting more thorough self-examinations, regardless of frequency, had about a 35% decrease in the occurrence of advanced-stage breast cancer compared to women who did not perform BSE.
 These results suggest that, while carefully performed BSE may avoid the development of some advanced-stage breast cancers, BSE as practiced by most Seattle-area women is of little or no benefit.

1183,"Thromboxane biosynthesis in cardiovascular diseases.
 Sudden fissuring of an atherosclerotic plaque has been suggested as the primary trigger of transient spontaneous ischemia in both the coronary and cerebral circulation.
 Measurements of urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 and 2,3-dinor-TXB2, as well as results of Aspirin trials, have suggested that episodic platelet activation at the site of this acute vascular lesion is mediated, at least partly, by enhanced thromboxane (TX) A2 biosynthesis.
 Thus, episodic increases in metabolite excretion have been detected in unstable angina.
 Aspirin (75-325 mg/day) prevents about one third of all fatal and nonfatal thrombotic events in this setting.
 That a similar ""dynamic"" thrombotic process occurs during the early phase of acute myocardial infarction is suggested by thromboxane metabolite measurements and by the results of the ISIS-2 trial showing a similar impact of short-term Aspirin therapy to that seen in unstable angina.
 Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is associated with transiently enhanced TXA2 biosynthesis and Aspirin-suppressable periprocedural thrombotic complications.
 On the other hand, both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and type IIa hypercholesterolemia are associated with a relatively reproducible and persisting abnormality of TXA2-dependent platelet function.
 This association is likely to reflect a systemic rather than localized stimulus to platelet activation and a continuous rather than episodic alteration.
 Low-dose (50 mg/day) Aspirin can largely suppress thromboxane metabolite excretion in both diseases.
 Thus, low-dose Aspirin and/or selective prostaglandin H2/TXA2-receptor antagonists may be important tools to test the hypothesis that TXA2-dependent platelet activation represents an important transducer of the enhanced thrombotic risk associated with these metabolic abnormalities.

 N-nitroso compounds (NOC) are strongly implicated in the causation of cancer of the stomach and it has been suggested that ascorbic acid might reduce the risk of gastric cancer by preventing their formation within gastric juice.
 However, until recently there have been no measurements of gastric juice ascorbic acid concentrations.
 We have measured both gastric juice ascorbic and total vitamin C (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid).
 Our findings suggest that ascorbic acid is secreted into the gastric lumen so that gastric juice concentrations are often greater than those in plasma.
 Gastric pathology affects this secretion, leading to values in gastric juice that are lower than plasma levels.
 Stimulation of gastric secretion does not raise vitamin C concentrations in individuals whose values are initially low.
 The role of ascorbic acid in preventing formation of NOC and protecting against gastric cancer is discussed in the light of these findings.

 To assess the potential of transesophageal echocardiography in evaluating CBFV and its variations induced by coronary-active drugs, we studied 15 patients by high-quality pulsed wave Doppler recordings of CBFV.
 In these patients, transesophageal Doppler evaluation of CBFV was performed before, 2 minutes after cessation of dipyridamole infusion (0.56 mg/kg in 4 minutes), and 2 minutes after aminophylline infusion (240 mg injected 4 minutes after cessation of dipyridamole infusion).
 The following CBFV parameters were evaluated at each of the three steps of the study protocol: maximal and mean diastolic velocities and maximal and mean systolic velocities.
 Furthermore, the following indexes of coronary flow reserve were evaluated: the ratio between maximal diastolic velocity recorded after and before dipyridamole administration and the ratio between mean diastolic velocity recorded after and before dipyridamole administration.
 Nine of the 15 patients had a normal left anterior descending coronary artery (group A), whereas the remaining six had significant (less than or equal to 75%) stenosis (group B).
 In group A patients, all CBFV parameters increased significantly during dipyridamole infusion and returned to near baseline values after aminophylline infusion.
 In group B patients, on the other hand, none of the CBFV parameters increased after dipyridamole infusion.
 Dipyridamole/baseline maximal diastolic velocity and mean diastolic velocity ratios were, respectively, 3.22 +/- 0.96 and 3.04 +/- 0.88 in group A and 1.46 +/- 0.45 (p less than 0.01 versus group A) and 1.48 +/- 0.49 (p less than 0.01 versus group A) in group B patients.

1188,"Skewflap versus long posterior flap in below-knee amputations: multicenter trial.
 A multicenter trial of alternative techniques for below-knee amputation is described in which surgeons in 11 centers randomized 191 patients with end-stage occlusive vascular disease to two different methods of stump construction.
 The skewflap technique was performed in 98 and the long posterior flap was performed in 93.
 The two groups were well matched in respect to age, sex, smoking, diabetes, and indications for amputation.
 Early outcome was compared in terms of 30-day mortality rate: skew 11 (11%) deaths versus long posterior flap 16 (17%); the state of the wound at 1 week (primary healing 60% in both groups); the need for surgical revision at the same level 7 (7%) versus 7 (8%), and revision to a higher level 10 (10%) versus 7 (8%).
 Follow-up information at 6 months was available from records or by mailed questionnaire in 188 (98%) at 6 months, 20 died during that interval.
 It showed that a prosthetic limb was fitted to 64 (84%) of skew flaps and 50 (77%) of long posterior flaps.
 Walking, alone or with support, was achieved in 59 (78%) and 46 (71%), respectively.
 None of these differences reached statistical significance.
 It is concluded that the skew flap is just as effective as the long posterior flap and is an excellent option for below-knee amputation.

 Management of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) should be based on the presence and progression of visual loss.
 To characterize the clinical course of IIH more completely, we monitored the clinical status, especially visual function, in 50 consecutive newly-diagnosed patients over a period of 2 to 39 months (average follow-up 12.4 months).
 The mean age at onset of symptoms was 31 (range 11-58) yrs; 46 (92%) were women and 47 (94%) were obese (mean weight 90 kg).
 Common symptoms were headache (92%), transient visual obscurations (72%) and intracranial noises (60%); 13 of the patients (26%) initially had complaints of sustained visual loss.
 There was visual loss as determined by Goldmann perimetry in 96% and by automated perimetry in 92%.
 Contrast sensitivity testing was abnormal in 50% and Snellen acuity in 22%.
 Two patients (4%) became blind in both eyes.
 The Goldmann visual field grade improved in 60% of patients but visual function deteriorated in 5 (10%).
 Deterioration of visual field grade was significantly associated only with weight gain during the year before diagnosis.
 Visual loss in patients with IIH is common and is often reversible.
 Patients should be evaluated by perimetry using an appropriate strategy and contrast sensitivity testing, along with careful examination of the optic discs.

 Seven cases of colorectal adenocarcinomas were investigated for the presence of oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors.
 The tumours specifically bound oestradiol.
 This binding almost exclusively resulted from the presence of high numbers of type II oestrogen binding sites.
 Oestrogen receptors were absent or present at very low concentrations.
 Immunohistochemical investigation of nuclear oestrogen receptors gave negative results.
 This indicates that antioestrogen receptor antibodies recognise oestrogen receptors but not type II oestrogen binding sites.

 An external fixation device that allows limited motion of the wrist joint without disruption of the anatomic alignment was used for the articular Colles' fractures in this study.
 From July 1985 to April 1989 during a 45-month period, 87 patients with 90 articular Colles' fractures (three cases with bilateral involvement) were treated with a modified dynamic external skeletal device after a closed reduction in full supination of the forearm.
 Excellent anatomic reduction near 91% of the sound wrist as well as satisfactory functional results around 90.5% of the sound wrist were gained during the 24-month follow-up period.
 Forearm muscles exert compression forces on distal radial metaphyseal fractures throughout the healing period.
 Any procedure or device that cannot provide constant counterforce to the action of forearm muscles during fracture healing will result in the loss of anatomic reduction.
 Adequate distraction counter-force was provided by an external fixation device that was superior to other conventional methods because of its simple application, low rate of complications, and excellent anatomic and functional results.

 A 7-year prospective study of a cohort of 1,458 normotensive adults from Utah pedigrees, screened from 1980 to 1985, was done to determine whether baseline levels of sodium-lithium countertransport were associated with an increased risk of future hypertension.
 Subsequent new hypertension (n = 39) was ascertained in 1989 from detailed follow-up medical questionnaires (67% response).
 Previous segregation analyses on a subset of these pedigree members who responded (n = 342) using family relationships in addition to countertransport levels have shown statistically inferred major gene segregation of sodium-lithium countertransport levels.
 In the normotensive adults inferred by segregation analysis to carry the recessive major gene for high sodium-lithium countertransport, new-onset hypertension occurred in 18.8% (3 of 16) compared with 3.7% (12 of 326) in the low sodium-lithium countertransport genotype group (relative risk, 4.6 [1.6, 13.9]; p = 0.03).
 However, an elevated baseline sodium-lithium countertransport level without genotype information from segregation analysis did not increase the risk of future hypertension in the complete cohort of adult pedigree members (relative risk, 1.02 [0.85, 1.22]).
 Adjustment for other risk factors reduced the relative risk to 0.90 (0.72, 1.11).
 We conclude that the presence of a major gene for sodium-lithium countertransport or another closely linked gene, rather than the actual level of sodium-lithium countertransport, may increase the risk of hypertension onset.
 High sodium-lithium countertransport levels do not increase the risk of future hypertension for individuals in whom only polygenic and environmental effects determine sodium-lithium countertransport level.

1193,"Passive smoking and heart disease. Epidemiology, physiology, and biochemistry.
 The evidence that ETS increases risk of death from heart disease is similar to that which existed in 1986 when the US Surgeon General concluded that ETS caused lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers.
 There are 10 epidemiological studies, conducted in a variety of locations, that reflect about a 30% increase in risk of death from ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction among nonsmokers living with smokers.
 The larger studies also demonstrate a significant dose-response effect, with greater exposure to ETS associated with greater risk of death from heart disease.
 These epidemiological studies are complemented by a variety of physiological and biochemical data that show that ETS adversely affects platelet function and damages arterial endothelium in a way that increases the risk of heart disease.
 Moreover, ETS, in realistic exposures, also exerts significant adverse effects on exercise capability of both healthy people and those with heart disease by reducing the body's ability to deliver and utilize oxygen.
 In animal experiments, ETS also depresses cellular respiration at the level of mitochondria.
 The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ETS also accelerate, and may initiate, the development of atherosclerotic plaque.
 Of note, the cardiovascular effects of ETS appear to be different in nonsmokers and smokers.
 Nonsmokers appear to be more sensitive to ETS than do smokers, perhaps because some of the affected physiological systems are sensitive to low doses of the compounds in ETS, then saturate, and also perhaps because of physiological adaptions smokers undergo as a result of long-term exposure to the toxins in cigarette smoke.
 In any event, these findings indicate that, for cardiovascular disease, it is incorrect to compute ""cigarette equivalents"" for passive exposure to ETS and then to extrapolate the effects of this exposure on nonsmokers from the effects of direct smoking on smokers.
 These results suggest that heart disease is an important consequence of exposure to ETS.
 The combination of epidemiological studies with demonstration of physiological changes with exposure to ETS, together with biochemical evidence that elements of ETS have significant adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, leads to the conclusion that ETS causes heart disease.
 This increase in risk translates into about 10 times as many deaths from ETS-induced heart disease as lung cancer; these deaths contribute greatly to the estimated 53,000 deaths annually from passive smoking.
 This toll makes passive smoking the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States today, behind active smoking and alcohol.

 Blunt traumatic rupture of the heart and pericardium, rarely diagnosed preoperatively, carries a high mortality rate.
 From 1979 to 1989, more than 20,000 patients were admitted to a Level I trauma center.
 A retrospective review identified 59 patients requiring emergency surgery for this condition.
 Injuries resulted from vehicular accidents (68%), motorcycle crashes (10%), pedestrians being struck by vehicles (7%), falls (5%), crushing (7%), and being struck by a horse (2%) or crane (2%).
 Seventeen patients (29%) had isolated rupture of the pericardium; 37 (63%) had ruptures of one or more cardiac chambers.
 All patients had signs of life at the scene or during transportation, but only 29 (49%) had vital signs on admission: 15 with chamber injury, 12 with pericardial rupture, and two with combined injuries.
 Diagnosis was established by emergency thoracotomy in the 30 patients who arrived in cardiac arrest.
 In the remaining 29 patients, diagnosis was made by urgent thoracotomy (41%), by subxiphoid pericardial window (34%), during laparotomy (21%), or by chest radiography (3%).

1195,"Exclusion of the Na(+)-H+ antiporter as a candidate gene in human essential hypertension.
 The primary abnormalities that contribute to the pathogenesis of human essential hypertension are unknown.
 The known genetic contribution to this disorder suggests the possible use of genetic linkage analysis to test whether specific candidate genes contribute to the pathogenesis of either essential hypertension or intermediate phenotypes.
 Among such phenotypes, elevated erythrocyte Na(+)-Li+ countertransport (SLC) is the best known, supporting major gene inheritance by pedigree analysis.
 Striking similarities between SLC and Na(+)-H+ exchange suggest that mutations at the Na(+)-H+ antiporter gene locus (APNH) might result in elevated SLC and contribute to the subsequent pathogenesis of hypertension.
 We have tested these hypotheses by genetic linkage analysis, with APNH as a candidate gene.
 By determining genotypes at APNH and flanking loci in pedigrees that support major gene segregation of elevated SLC, we have excluded linkage of APNH and the major SLC locus with a LOD score of -5.91, an odds ratio of almost 1,000,000:1 against linkage.
 In the analysis of 93 hypertensive sibling pairs, we have further demonstrated that APNH explains none of the variance in SLC in hypertensive individuals (r2 = 6 x 10(-7), p greater than 0.99).
 Finally, we have directly tested for linkage of APNH to genes predisposing toward hypertension by linkage in hypertensive sibling pairs.
 Mean allele sharing at APNH is not greater than expected from random assortment in hypertensive siblings (0.92 versus 1.0, p greater than 0.80), and the upper 95% confidence limit of this value (1.04) indicates that mutations at APNH rarely if ever contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension in this population.

1196,"Risk factors for emphysema. Cigarette smoking is associated with a reduction in the association rate constant of lung alpha 1-antitrypsin for neutrophil elastase.
 The increased risk of developing emphysema among individuals who smoke cigarettes and who have normal levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) is hypothesized to result from a decrease in the antineutrophil elastase capacity of the lower respiratory tract alpha 1AT of smokers compared with nonsmokers.
 To evaluate this hypothesis we compared the time-dependent kinetics of the inhibition of neutrophil elastase by lung alpha 1AT from healthy, young cigarette smokers (n = 8) and nonsmokers (n = 12).
 alpha 1-antitrypsin was purified from lavage fluid using affinity and molecular sieve chromatography, and the association rate constant (k assoc) for neutrophil elastase quantified.
 The k assoc of smoker plasma alpha 1AT (9.5 +/- 0.5 X 10(6) M-1s-1) was similar to that of nonsmoker plasma (9.3 +/- 0.7 X 10(6) M-1s-1, P greater than 0.5).
 In marked contrast, the k assoc of smoker lower respiratory tract alpha 1AT was significantly lower than that of nonsmoker alpha 1AT (6.5 +/- 0.4 X 10(6) M-1s-1 vs.
 8.1 +/- 0.5 X 10(6) M-1s-1, P less than 0.01).
 Furthermore, the smoker lower respiratory tract alpha 1AT k assoc was significantly less than that of autologous plasma (P less than 0.01).
 When considered in the context of the concentration of alpha 1AT in the lower respiratory tract epithelial lining fluid, the inhibition time for neutrophil elastase of smoker lung alpha 1AT was twofold greater than that of nonsmoker lung alpha 1AT (smoker: 0.34 +/- 0.05 s vs.
 nonsmoker: 0.17 +/- 0.05 s, P less than 0.01).
 Consequently, for concentrations of alpha 1AT in the lower respiratory tract it takes twice as long for an equivalent amount of neutrophil elastase to be inhibited in the smoker's lung compared with the nonsmoker's lung.
 These observations support the concept that cigarette smoking is associated with a decrease in the lower respiratory tract neutrophil elastase inhibitory capacity, thus increasing the vulnerability of the lung to elastolytic destruction and thereby increasing the risk for the development of emphysema.

 To assess the efficacy and safety of the ultra short-acting beta-blocking agent, esmolol, in acute unstable angina, we administered esmolol to 21 patients who had persistent angina despite conventional medical therapy.
 Following a baseline Doppler echocardiographic examination, esmolol was titrated to reduce the rate-pressure product by at least 20%.
 Once the patients had been receiving a maintenance dosage for 30 minutes, Doppler echocardiographic studies were repeated.
 Mean esmolol dose at target response was 17 +/- 16 mg/min, with the dosage range of 8 to 24 mg/min.
 Esmolol was effective in alleviating anginal chest pain in 18 of the 21 patients.
 Seven patients eventually underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and eight had coronary bypass surgery.
 The remainder were discharged receiving medical therapy including oral beta-blockade.
 During esmolol therapy, heart rate and blood pressure decreased significantly (86 +/- 14 to 68 +/- 12 beats/min and 125 +/- 16 to 103 +/- 20 mm Hg, both p less than 0.001).

 Heart rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and minute ventilation were monitored continuously.
 Two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained before testing to calculate the right ventricular inflow volume indexed to body surface area.
 All patients achieved maximal aerobic capacity based on their ventilatory patterns and respiratory exchange ratio.
 Maximal heart rate was reduced (175 beats/min; 87% of predicted for age) and maximal oxygen consumption was decreased (31 ml/kg per min; 75% of predicted for age and gender).
 There was no correlation between maximal oxygen consumption and maximal heart rate.
 Right ventricular volume index, however, had a significant inverse correlation with maximal heart rate (r = -0.62, p less than 0.005).
 There was no correlation between right ventricular volume index and heart rate at rest.
 These results suggest that decreased maximal oxygen consumption in patients after the Mustard procedure is not a result of chronotropic impairment.

 Ouabain-induced arrhythmias are a well-known model used to study triggered activity resulting from delayed afterdepolarizations.
 In the intact heart, initiation of these arrhythmias is promoted by pacing, especially at fast rates.
 However, the relevance of the number of stimuli is unknown.
 In conscious dogs with formalin-induced atrioventricular block, we investigated the effect of variations in pacing mode on 1) the behavior of nonsustained triggered rhythms at progressive levels of ouabain intoxication, and 2) the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).
 Twenty experiments were analyzed.
 Ouabain was administered as a bolus of 40 micrograms/kg followed by continuous infusion.
 Every 15 minutes the pacing protocol was repeated, with a maximum of 10, until completion or induction of VT.
 When VT could not be initiated, the experiment was repeated at least 1 week later, adding 5-10 micrograms/kg ouabain to the bolus and increasing the infusion rate correspondingly.
 This was repeated until VT could be induced.
 Four interstimulus intervals (200, 400, 600, and 800 msec) and seven numbers of stimuli (5, 10, 20, 35, 50, 100, and 150) were given in two pacing protocols.
 The effect of these protocols on 1) the number of induced beats per stimulation train, 2) their first postpacing interval, and 3) induction of VT were studied.
 Initiation of VT occurred after 75 +/- 42 minutes.
 The bolus of ouabain needed to induce VT was inversely related to the body weight of the animals.
 Progression of ouabain intoxication resulted in 1) a significant increase in the number of induced beats per stimulation train and 2) a significant shortening of the first postpacing interval.
 Stimulation at a faster rate and/or more stimuli resulted in 1) a significantly pronounced increase in the number of induced beats at the higher levels and 2) a significantly shorter first postpacing interval at successive levels of ouabain intoxication.

1203,"Role of angiotensin in the renal vasoconstriction observed during the development of genetic hypertension.
 Studies have examined renal function to determine the role of the kidney in the pathogenesis and maintenance phases of hypertension in the Okamoto-Aoki strain of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR).
 As compared to age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), 4- to 6-week old SHR are moderately hypertensive and have a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF), and an increased renal vascular resistance.
 Cross-breeding studies indicate the reduction in RBF and GFR in young SHR is genetically linked to the hypertension and thus may be of primary pathogenetic importance.
 The combination of an elevated vascular resistance and reduced RBF and GFR in young SHR implicates increased activity of a vasoconstrictor system(s), decreased activity of a vasodilator system(s), or both.
 Observations from several laboratories support the notion that endogenous angiotensin II contributes to the renal vasoconstriction in young SHR during the developmental phase of hypertension.
 Acute and chronic inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme reduce arterial pressure, reduce renal vascular resistance and increase renal blood flow in young and adult SHR.
 Renal vascular tone in SHR is more dependent on angiotensin converting enzyme activity than that in WKY.
 The ability of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to produce renal vasodilation may be responsible, at least in part, for its antihypertensive effects.
 Other studies indicate that renal vascular reactivity to angiotensin II is exaggerated in young SHR.
 The strain differences in renal reactivity to angiotensin II can be abolished by cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin, indicating that endogenous prostanoids counteract some of the constrictor action of angiotensin II, with more pronounced buffering activity in WKY.

 Anti-Id 6, 35, 61, 65 bound in a direct binding assay with various affinity to all rat anti-AChR mAb that were tested.
 Anti-Id IR27 recognized none of the anti-AChR mAb.
 The specificity of these crossreactions was confirmed by inhibition studies with anti-AChR mAb and two control rat myeloma proteins (IR27 and IR241).
 In addition, the Id expression on mAb D6, a mouse anti-human AChR mAb was recognized by anti-Id 6, 35, and 65.
 Anti-Id, except anti-Id IR27, bound to affinity purified IgG from the sera of rats with EAMG, but not to preimmune Lewis IgG.
 These results suggest extensive sharing of idiotopes among anti-AChR mAb, which are also present in EAMG serum.
 Anti-AChR mAb against the main immunogenic region (6, 35, 65) from different rat strains, shared at least one paratope-related cross-reactive idiotopes.

 BACKGROUND.
 A reliable, noninvasive procedure to determine the location of accessory atrioventricular connections in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome would add an important diagnostic tool to the clinical armamentarium.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Body surface potential mapping (BSPM) using 180 electrodes in various-sized vests and displayed as a calibrated color map was used to determine the ventricular insertion site of the accessory atrioventricular (AV) connections in 34 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
 Attempts were made to determine the 17 ventricular insertion sites described by Guiraudon et al.
 All 34 patients had an electrophysiologic study (EPS) at cardiac catheterization, and 18 had surgery so the ventricular insertion sites could be accurately located using EPS at surgery.
 A number of physiologic observations were also made with BSPM.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The following conclusions were drawn: 1) BSPM using QRS analysis accurately predicts the ventricular insertion site of accessory AV connections in the presence of a delta wave in the electrocardiogram; 2) the ventricular insertion sites of accessory AV connections determined by BSPM and by EPS at surgery were identical or within one mapping site (1.5 cm or less) in all but four of 18 cases; three of the four exceptions had more than one accessory AV connection, and the other had a very broad ventricular insertion; 3) BSPM and EPS locations of the accessory AV connections correlated very well in the 34 cases despite the fact that BSPM determines the ventricular insertion site and EPS determines the atrial insertion site of the accessory AV connection; 4) as suggested by the three cases of multiple accessory AV connections, EPS and BSPM may be complementary since BSPM identified one pathway and EPS identified the other (in the case with a broad ventricular insertion, BSPM and EPS demonstrated different proportions of that insertion); 5) BSPM using ST-T analysis is very much less accurate in predicting the ventricular insertion site of accessory AV connections unless there is marked preexcitation; 6) standard electrocardiography using the Gallagher grid methodology (but with no attempt at stimulating maximal preexcitation) was not as accurate as QRS analysis of BSPM in predicting the ventricular insertion site of the accessory AV connection; however, exact comparison is hampered by the different number and size of the Gallagher and Guiraudon insertion sites; 7) BSPM using QRS analysis appears to be very accurate in predicting right ventricular versus left ventricular posteroseptal accessory AV connections; 8) typical epicardial right ventricular breakthrough, indicative of conduction via the specialized AV conduction system, occurs in all patients with left ventricular free wall accessory AV connections; 9) epicardial right ventricular breakthrough was not observed in cases with right ventricular free wall or anteroseptal accessory AV connections; 10) epicardial right ventricular breakthrough can occur in the presence of posteroseptal accessory AV connections, whether right or left ventricular; and 11) the delay in epicardial right ventricular breakthrough in cases with left ventricular insertion may provide a marker to estimate the degree of ventricular preexcitation.

 All of the mutants were expressed, along with the full length, cysteine-containing analogue, in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins, joined to beta-galactosidase through a collagen linker.
 This system allows microgram quantities of the rIL-6 variants to be partially purified from small bacterial cultures without chromatographic or refolding steps.
 Each of the rIL-6 variants was released from the beta-galactosidase fusion protein with collagenase, and the recovered rIL-6 was quantitated by laser densitometry of Coomassie-stained, SDS polyacrylamide gels.
 The sp.
 ac.
 of each of the rIL-6 variants was determined using four assays: induction of IgM secretion from an EBV transformed human B cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a human hepatoma cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a rat hepatoma cell line, and induction of proliferation of a murine hybridoma cell line.
 Replacement of cysteines with serines reduced activity relative to cysteine-containing rIL-6 to about 20% in the rat hepatoma assay and about 3% in the mouse hybridoma assay, whereas activity in both of the human cell lines was reduced to less than 0.1%.
 These data suggest that the murine and rat cell lines are less selective than the human cell lines in their requirements for recognition of biologically active IL-6.
 Each of the deletions, except that of amino acids 4 through 23, resulted in loss of activity in all four assays.
 These results suggest that the information necessary for activity is not contained within any one portion of the IL-6 molecule, but rather that multiple segments of the protein are required for each of the biologic activities that we tested.

1211,"Nocturnal sleep recording with cassette EEG in chronic headaches.
 Many headache patients complain of poor sleep, and sleep disturbance has been shown to play a role in chronic pain.
 We recorded nocturnal sleep with a 4-channel cassette EEG monitoring device in 10 common migraine patients, 10 individuals with muscle contraction (tension) headache, and 10 chronic tension-vascular headache sufferers.
 Migraine patients had essentially normal sleep, although rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and REM latency were increased.
 Patients with tension headache had reduced sleep time and sleep efficiency, decreased sleep latency but frequent awakenings, increased nocturnal movements, and marked reduction in slow wave sleep, without change in REM sleep or latency.
 Mixed-element headaches with both tension and vascular features were associated with reduced sleep, increased awakening, diminished slow wave sleep, and REM sleep that was decreased in amount and reduced in latency.
 The findings suggest that patients with intermittent migraine may have minimal sleep disturbance, while chronic headache may be worsened by chronically poor sleep.
 Muscle contraction headache may be associated with frequent awakenings and decreased slow wave sleep similar to the sleep changes of fibrositis, while chronic tension-vascular headache may have a depressive substrate.
 Four-channel sleep recording may miss contributory sleep apnea, but nonetheless cassette EEG may facilitate outpatient evaluation of refractory headaches.

1212,"5-year results of cisplatin and fluorouracil infusion in head and neck cancer.
 As part of the developmental process for the Head and Neck Intergroup trial of adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced resectable head and neck carcinoma, in 1981 the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, Philadelphia, Pa, conducted two nonrandomized pilot studies using chemotherapy consisting of three courses of cisplatin and fluorouracil infusion.
 Chemotherapy was administered prior to surgery in 42 patients (induction) and after surgery in an additional 29 patients (sequential).
 The populations were roughly comparable with respect to tumor site and stage.
 Twelve of the 42 patients in the induction group and seven of the 29 in the sequential group are alive and with no evidence of disease at the last reported follow-up.
 The median survival was 31 months in the sequential group vs 20 months in the induction group.
 Only two of the 26 patients with less than a complete clinical response following induction chemotherapy are still alive.
 Twenty-seven of the 42 patients who received induction chemotherapy did not undergo surgery as initially planned.
 Despite the lack of surgery, at 5 years the survival between the two groups was not significantly different (27% for the induction group vs 23% for the sequential group).

1214,"Catheter modification of the atrioventricular junction with radiofrequency energy for control of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia.
 BACKGROUND.
 The utility of transcatheter application of radiofrequency energy to eliminate atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) was investigated.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Thirty-nine patients (mean age, 53 +/- 20 years; range 14-86 years) with medically refractory AVNRT underwent perinodal ablation with radiofrequency energy.
 A custom-designed 6F catheter with a large (3-mm-long) distal electrode and interelectrode pacing of 2 mm was used in the majority of cases.
 The catheter used for ablation was initially positioned across the tricuspid anulus to obtain the largest His bundle electrogram, then withdrawn to obtain the largest atrial:ventricular electrogram ratio, with a small His bundle electrogram (less than or equal to 100 microV).
 Each application of radiofrequency energy (350-550 kHz, 16.2 +/- 5.2 W) was stopped after 60 seconds or if PR prolongation or an impedance rise was noted.
 The endpoints of the procedure were persistent modification of atrioventricular nodal conduction (either first-degree atrioventricular block or impairment of ventriculoatrial conduction) and noninducibility of AVNRT before and during isoproterenol administration.
 Radiofrequency energy was applied a mean of 6.8 +/- 3.5 times per session.
 After a mean follow-up of 8 +/- 3.0 months, 32 of the 39 patients (82%) have been free of AVNRT, and did not have high grade AV block.
 Three patients (8%) developed complete atrioventricular block and had pacemakers implanted.
 Two patients had unsuccessful initial procedures, and two patients had initially successful ablations but had recurrences of tachycardia 4-6 weeks later.
 Elimination of AVNRT appeared to be due to effects on the retrograde fast pathway in most patients.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Radiofrequency ablation of the perinodal right atrium appears to be safe and effective for treatment of typical AVNRT.

 A squamous cell carcinoma in situ arose in an ovarian mature teratoma (ie, dermoid cyst) in a 62-year-old woman.
 Flow cytometric DNA content analysis of paraffin-embedded in situ carcinoma showed a normal DNA content with moderate to high proliferative activity (S-phase fraction estimate, 16% to 18%).
 Cytogenetic analysis of the in situ cancer and the benign cystic portion of the tumor revealed a 46,XX karyotype.
 In addition, the benign cystic portion of the tumor revealed homozygous chromosomal heteromorphisms, compared with heterozygous markers found in peripheral blood lymphocytes.
 These results show that this squamous cell carcinoma in situ was euploid and suggest that the mature cystic teratoma was derived from a single germ cell after meiosis I.

1216,"Evaluation of preload reserve during isometric exercise testing in patients with old myocardial infarction: Doppler echocardiographic study.
 To estimate the preload reserve in response to an increase in afterload in patients with old myocardial infarction, the relation between the Doppler echocardiographic inflow velocity pattern and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was investigated during isometric handgrip exercise testing.
 The study population consisted of 16 normal subjects and 40 patients with old myocardial infarction.
 The 40 patients were subdivided into two groups according to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure at rest: group I (22 patients), less than 18 mm Hg; group II (18 patients), 18 mm Hg or more.
 At rest, the ratio of peak velocity in atrial contraction phase to peak velocity in early diastolic filling phase (A/E) was significantly higher in the patients with old myocardial infarction than in normal subjects; values in the two subgroups of myocardial infarction did not differ significantly.
 The A/E ratio and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased significantly during exercise in group I.
 Conversely, the change in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during exercise in group II was significantly greater than that in group I, and was associated with a decrease in the A/E ratio.
 Thus, an atrial compensatory mechanism operated effectively in response to the increase in afterload in patients with a normal left ventricular filling pressure, whereas this compensatory mechanism deteriorated in patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressure due to a limited preload reserve.

1217,"Analysis of the Medtronic Intact bioprosthetic valve. Effects of ""zero-pressure"" fixation.
 The long-term performance of current-design porcine xenograft valves has not been satisfactory.
 These valves are generally fixed at ""low pressures"" of about 3 to 5 mm Hg.
 The Medtronic Intact (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.) valve is fixed at ""zero pressure"" and is proposed as a better alternative to existing xenograft valves.
 A mechanical analysis of this valve has been carried out to determine if the Intact valve differs significantly from the low-pressure fixed xenograft.
 Twelve circumferential strips of tissue 5 mm wide were cut from the leaflets of four clinical-grade Intact valves.
 Their stress/strain, stress relaxation, and flexural behavior were examined mechanically and histologically.
 The Intact valve was more extensible than the low-pressure fixed xenograft (22% versus 12% strain, p less than 0.001), relaxed faster (p less than 0.001), and was more pliable than the xenograft (p less than 0.05).
 It did not, however, buckle less than did the low-pressure fixed xenograft during enforced bending, and it buckled significantly more than did fresh porcine aortic valve tissue (p less than 0.001).
 The Intact valve also relaxed significantly more slowly than did the fresh tissue (p less than 0.05).
 Its bending stiffness had a stronger dependence on leaflet thickness than the bending thickness of fresh tissue had (p less than 0.001) but a weaker dependence than the bending thickness of the low-pressure fixed xenograft material had (p less than 0.001).
 The Intact valve demonstrated a very large variability in extensibility, bending stiffness, and buckling behavior, with little correlation between these parameters.
 Some valves appeared to have wrinkled leaflets; others were likely fixed at different pressures.
 The shrinkage of the leaflet material at these low fixation pressures is likely important, since it can modify the elastic behavior of the valve cusps.
 Overall, the Intact valve had a more ""natural"" elastic behavior than had low-pressure fixed xenograft, and it should therefore experience lower stresses during normal valve function.
 It can be concluded that zero-pressure fixation does preserve many of the desirable stress-reducing properties of aortic valve tissue.

1218,"Limitations of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound-directed (duplex) scanning in the diagnosis of subclavian vein thrombosis.
 To investigate the potential role of magnetic resonance imaging and duplex scanning in the diagnosis of catheter-induced subclavian vein thrombosis, we correlated the results of 43 arm phlebograms with duplex scans; 28 of these phlebograms were also correlated with magnetic resonance imaging scans of the thoracic veins.
 Eighteen of the 43 phlebograms were normal, and all had normal magnetic resonance imaging and duplex studies.
 Eleven subclavian veins were totally occluded on phlebography; all had duplex scans, and five were also scanned with magnetic resonance imaging.
 Duplex scans detected 6 of 11 occlusions, whereas magnetic resonance imaging detected 4 of the 5 occlusions scanned.
 The five occlusions that were not detected by either magnetic resonance imaging or duplex scans were short segmental occlusions of the medial one third of the left subclavian vein.
 Of 14 nonocclusive thrombi seen on phlebography, duplex scans correctly identified 8.
 Magnetic resonance imaging was done on eight nonocclusive thrombi but identified only two.
 All abnormal findings on duplex scanning and magnetic resonance imaging were confirmed by phlebography.
 Short occlusions of the proximal portion of the left subclavian vein were often undetected by duplex scanning but occasionally seen with magnetic resonance imaging.
 Neither modality was sensitive to the presence of nonocclusive mural thrombi.
 Magnetic resonance imaging is highly reliable in ruling out the presence of a thrombotic process in the subclavian vein, but it may on occasion fail to detect the presence of subclavian thrombi.
 For this reason, in cases with suspected subclavian vein thrombosis magnetic resonance imaging cannot be used as the only diagnostic modality.

 The planning of health education aimed at preventing sports injuries is often incomplete and not stated explicitly.
 In most instances, the evaluation is incomplete or nonexistent.
 We present a theoretical framework for planning and evaluating health education, illustrating the main points by using as an example the health education for downhill skiers.
 Systematic planning consists of analyzing the magnitude of the problem and the behavioral risk factors, studying behavior determinants, designing an optimal intervention, and implementing the intervention.
 The evaluation phase deals with the effects on these five levels (implementation, intervention, determinants, behavior, and incidence of injury).
 Some common pitfalls are mentioned and special attention is given to the study of determinants of behavior and to the design of the intervention.
 The importance of pretesting health education material and the community approach in educating sports participants is underlined.
 Health education, together with regulations and facilities, constitutes the health promotion strategy in the prevention of sports injuries.
 For most sports, there seems to be a strong need for further research on the etiology and determinants of behavior before effective prevention can be realized.

1224,"Ethanol causes accelerated G1 arrest in differentiating HL-60 cells.
 The effects of clinically relevant ethanol concentrations on myeloid differentiation in the HL-60 cell promyelocytic leukemia line have been studied.
 The exposure of noninduced stem cells to 60 mM ethanol results in an increase in G1 cells, but there is no increase in superoxide production or expression of the Mo1 antigen.
 When HL-60 cells are induced to differentiate along the myeloid line with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or retinoic acid (RA), there is a shift to smaller cell size, an increase in G1 cells and acquisition of the ability to produce superoxide as reported previously by several authors.
 When ethanol is present during differentiation, there are further increases in G1 cells, and increases in the percentage of cells which produce superoxide and express Mo1, and decreases in mean cell size and total growth during the incubation period.
 Regrowth experiments after periods of differentiation indicate that the increased G1 arrest seen in the presence of ethanol represents terminal commitment if inducer is present, but in the absence of inducer the increased G1 percentage is readily reversible.
 Examination of RNA content by flow cytometry reveals a decrease in both the peak and mean G1 RNA content during DMSO or RA induced differentiation.
 These decreases are accentuated by the presence of ethanol, resulting in a higher G1A/G1B ratio than in nonexposed cells.
 These findings indicate that ethanol enhances G1 growth arrest in HL-60 cells exposed to myeloid inducers.
 Partial differentiation occurs during this process, resulting in terminally arrested cells, some of which have undergone fewer postinduction cell divisions than normal and may not be fully competent.

 NIH 3T3 cells undergo morphological transformation in response to conditions of constrained growth, such as occur in low serum concentrations or at confluence.
 Transformation is expressed in a small fraction of the cells by the appearance of discrete foci of multiplying cells on a confluent monolayer of quiescent cells.
 We isolated and expanded cell populations from three dense and three light foci.
 Cells from each of these populations efficiently reproduced foci of the same morphotype when grown on a background of nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells.
 Using cultures derived from one of the dense foci (subline D/2), we found that the number of focus-forming units was stable and the cells remained tumorigenic when they were subjected to repeated thrice-weekly passage in 2% calf serum.
 However, equivalent passage in 10% calf serum eventually rendered the cells incapable of both focus production and tumor formation.
 The results show that the capacity to produce tumors as well as morphological transformation are produced as a response to physiological constraints of growth and/or metabolism in the absence of carcinogens and that both properties can be reversed by lifting the constraints.
 This behavior is typical of an adaptational response and, taken together with other supporting evidence, shows that tumorigenesis does not require conventional genetic alteration.

 This study investigated the effect of physical training on muscle blood flow (BF) in rats with peripheral arterial insufficiency during treadmill running.
 Bilateral stenosis of the femoral artery of adult rats (300-350 g) was performed to reduce exercise hyperemia in the hindlimb but not limit resting muscle BF.
 Rats were divided into normal sedentary, acute stenosed (stenosed 3 days before the experiment), stenosed sedentary (limited to cage activity), and stenosed trained (run on a treadmill by a progressively intense program, up to 50-60 min/day, 5 days/wk for 6-8 wk).
 Hindlimb BF was determined with 85Sr- and 141Ce-labeled microspheres at a low (20 m/min) and high treadmill speed (30-40 m/min depending on ability).
 Maximal hindlimb BF was reduced to approximately 50% normal in the acute stenosed group.
 Total hindlimb BF (81 +/- 5 ml.min-1.100 g-1) did not change in stenosed sedentary animals with 6-8 wk of cage activity, but a redistribution of BF occurred within the hindlimb.
 Two factors contributed to a higher BF to the distal limb muscle of the trained animals.
 A redistribution BF within the hindlimb occurred in stenosed trained animals; distal limb BF increased to approximately 80% (P less than 0.001) of the proximal tissue.
 In addition, an increase in total hindlimb BF with training indicates that collateral BF has been enhanced (P less than 0.025).
 The associated increase in oxygen delivery to the relatively ischemic muscle probably contributed to the markedly improved exercise tolerance evident in the trained animals.

 PURPOSE: To review the evidence supporting the belief that caffeine causes cardiac arrhythmias.
 DATA SOURCES: Studies published since 1982 identified through computerized searches of MEDLINE, TOXLINE, and Chemical Abstracts and a review of bibliographies of relevant articles on the subject of caffeine and cardiac arrhythmias.
 STUDY SELECTION: All clinical studies examining caffeine as a cause of cardiac arrhythmias and a selection of basic science experiments to illustrate caffeine's effects in vitro.
 DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality was assessed and all available clinical data pertaining to caffeine as a cause of arrhythmias were summarized.
 RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: In one electrophysiologic study, caffeine was associated with an increased susceptibility to provoked cardiac arrhythmias.
 In five placebo-controlled trials, caffeine in doses up to 500 mg daily (equivalent to 5 to 6 cups of coffee) did not increase the frequency or severity of ventricular arrhythmias.
 One large epidemiologic study reported an increase in the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles in persons consuming 9 or more cups of coffee daily.
 CONCLUSION: Moderate ingestion of caffeine does not increase the frequency or severity of cardiac arrhythmias in normal persons, patients with ischemic heart disease, or those with pre-existing serious ventricular ectopy.

1231,"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 
 BACKGROUND.
 A high incidence of hypertension (50 to 75 percent) occurs early in the course of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
 Cyst enlargement, causing bilateral renal ischemia and subsequent release of renin, is proposed as the cause of this form of hypertension.
 METHODS.
 To investigate this hypothesis, we measured plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations during short-term and long-term converting-enzyme inhibition in 14 patients with hypertension due to polycystic kidney disease, 9 patients with essential hypertension, 11 normotensive patients with polycystic kidney disease, and 13 normal subjects.
 The groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, body-surface area, degree of hypertension, sodium excretion, and renal function.
 RESULTS.
 During the short-term study, the mean (+/- SE) plasma renin activity was significantly higher in the hypertensive patients with polycystic kidney disease than in the patients with essential hypertension, in the supine (0.36 +/- 0.06 vs.
 0.22 +/- 0.06 ng per liter.second, P = 0.05) and upright positions (1.03 +/- 0.14 vs.
 0.61 +/- 0.08 ng per liter.second, P less than 0.03) and after converting-enzyme inhibition (1.97 +/- 0.28 vs.
 0.67 +/- 0.17 ng per liter.second, P less than 0.0006).
 The mean arterial pressures measured in the supine and upright positions and the plasma aldosterone concentrations measured in the upright position were significantly higher in the normotensive patients with polycystic kidney disease than in the normal subjects.
 After six weeks of converting-enzyme inhibition, renal plasma flow increased (P less than 0.005), and both renal vascular resistance (P less than 0.007) and the filtration fraction (P less than 0.02) decreased significantly in the hypertensive patients with polycystic kidney disease but not in the patients with essential hypertension.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is stimulated significantly more in hypertensive patients with polycystic kidney disease than in comparable patients with essential hypertension.
 The increased renin release, perhaps due to renal ischemia caused by cyst expansion, probably contributes to the early development of hypertension in polycystic kidney disease.

 To investigate the role of glutamic (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp) in migraine, we measured the plasma amino acids in migraine patients with and without aura, between and during attacks, and compared the profiles with the plasma amino acid profiles of tension headache patients and healthy controls.
 Between attacks, migraineurs (notably with aura) had substantially higher plasma Glu and Asp levels than did controls and tension headache patients.
 In addition, patients with migraine without aura showed low plasma histidine levels.
 During migraine attacks, Glu (and to a lesser extent Asp) levels were even further increased.
 The results suggest a defective cellular reuptake mechanism for Glu and Asp in migraineurs, and we hypothesize a similar defect at the neuronal/glial cell level, predisposing the brain of migraineurs to develop spreading depression.

 Regulation of insulin secretion involves the coordinated control of ion channels in the beta-cell membrane.
 We have isolated and characterized cDNA and genomic clones encoding a voltage-dependent K+ channel isoform expressed in human islets and in a human insulinoma.
 This K+ channel isoform, designated hPCN1, with a deduced amino acid sequence of 613 residues (Mr = 67,097), is related to the Shaker family of Drosophila K+ channels.
 hPCN1 is homologous to two other human K+ channel isoforms we have isolated, hPCN2 and hPCN3, with 55% and 65% amino acid sequence identity, respectively.
 The electrophysiological characteristics of hPCN1 were determined after microinjection of synthetic RNA into Xenopus oocytes.
 Two-microelectrode voltage-clamp recordings of oocytes injected with hPCN1 RNA revealed a voltage-dependent outward K+ current that inactivated slowly with time.
 Outward currents were inhibited by 4-aminopyridine with a Ki less than 0.10 mM and were relatively insensitive to tetraethylammonium ion or Ba2+.
 A delayed rectifier K+ channel such as hPCN1 could restore the resting membrane potential of beta cells after depolarization and thereby contribute to the regulation of insulin secretion.

 The pathologic material from 56 patients diagnosed initially as Ewing's sarcoma of the distal extremity and treated on National Cancer Institute protocols between 1968 and 1984 was reviewed and correlated with clinical outcome.
 Histologically, the tumors were categorized, based on recent pathologic criteria, into three diagnostic groups: (1) typical Ewing's sarcoma, (2) atypical Ewing's sarcoma, and (3) other (predominantly peripheral neuroepithelioma [PN]).
 Thirty-two patients (57%) had typical Ewing's, 13 (23%) were atypical, and 11 (20%) were in the ""other"" diagnostic category (seven [13%] PN, two primitive rhabdomyosarcoma, one primitive sarcoma of bone, and one synovial cell sarcoma).
 No cases of metastatic neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, or lymphoma were found.
 Forty-five patients had localized disease at diagnosis; 11 had metastases.
 Patients with typical Ewing's sarcoma were less likely to have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.
 Only two of 32 patients with typical Ewing's sarcoma had metastases compared with nine of 24 patients in the two other groups.
 The pattern of relapse was also different in these other groups compared with typical Ewing's patients; five patients developed lymph node metastases and two patients developed brain metastases.
 Although the presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis was a strong negative prognostic factor, our histologic grouping was independently prognostic of clinical outcome in patients with localized disease.
 Patients with typical osseous Ewing's sarcoma had an improved overall survival (P2 = 0.03) and patients with other tumors (neither typical nor atypical Ewing's sarcoma) had a poorer disease-free survival (P2 = 0.02).
 Since no generally accepted histopathologic prognostic criteria exist for Ewing's sarcoma, the potential value of our proposed classification should be evaluated in a larger retrospective and a prospective study.

1237,"Isolated subclavian artery dissection after blunt trauma.
 We present a case report of a patient with an isolated dissection of the subclavian artery after blunt trauma.
 The patient who was admitted to our center after a motor vehicle accident, complained of chest and neck pain and physical findings of diminished left extremity pulses.
 Arteriography showed an occluded subclavian artery with the possibility of a dissection.
 The dissection was confirmed at surgery with the proximal extent originating just distal to the origin of the vertebral artery.
 The distal extent of the dissection was not determined.
 Operative repair was performed by a carotid-to-subclavian artery bypass obliterating the false lumen of the dissection with a running vascular anastomosis.
 The patient, who was discharged 5 days after repair, had normal extremity neurovascular function at 4 months follow-up.

 In a prospective study of 8881 postmenopausal female residents of a retirement community in southern California, we evaluated in detail the relationship between estrogen use and overall mortality.
 After 7 1/2 years of follow-up, there had been 1447 deaths.
 Women with a history of estrogen use had 20% lower age-adjusted, all-cause mortality than lifetime nonusers (95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.87).
 Mortality decreased with increasing duration of use and was lower among current users than among women who used estrogens only in the distant past.
 Current users with more than 15 years of estrogen use had a 40% reduction in their overall mortality.
 Among oral estrogen users, relative risks of death could not be distinguished by specific dosages of the oral estrogen taken for the longest time.
 Women who had used estrogen replacement therapy had a reduced mortality from all categories of acute and chronic arteriosclerotic disease and cerebrovascular disease.
 This group of women had a reduced mortality from cancer, although this reduction was not statistically significant.
 The mortality from all remaining causes combined was the same in estrogen users and lifetime nonusers.

 The relation between three-dimensional geometry of the inflow tract to the orifice and the area, shape, and velocity of regurgitant jets was studied in a pulsatile in vitro color Doppler flow model.
 A 2.5 MHz transducer connected to a diagnostic ultrasound machine was placed in a water tank facing pulsatile jets (duration, 0.5 second) obtained by a calibrated injector.
 Flow rate from 6 to 52 ml/sec were tested through a 5 mm diameter circular orifice.
 Four different three-dimensional inflow tract geometries were compared: (A) sharp-edged, (B) Venturi (funnel), (C) converging conical, and (D) diverging conical.
 Mean velocities of jets were measured by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography.
 Driving pressures were also measured by means of a fluid-filled catheter.
 Two observers independently digitized contours of maximal color jet areas by computer system from two separate sets of experiments.
 Results are given as the mean values of the four measurements for each parameter.
 Jet areas were correlated to flow rate, with no difference from A through D.
 The shape (eccentricity) of jets was different between A and B (p less than 0.05), between B and D (p less than 0.01), and between C and D (p less than 0.01).
 The shape of jets was correlated with flow rate, continuous-wave velocity, and pressure gradient in B, C, and D but not in A.
 Measured pressure gradients and estimated gradients by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography were similarly correlated from A through D.

1242,"Research in physical medicine and rehabilitation. XII. Measurement tools with application to brain injury.
 There are basic principles and techniques of measurement that are relevant across biomedical disciplines.
 The purpose of this article is to explain some of the most important of these for medical rehabilitation, to illustrate how to use them to choose assessment instruments and to describe the nature of measurement in medical rehabilitation by examples in brain injury rehabilitation.
 Reliability is basic to any scientific measure.
 Validity, the ultimate criterion, is closely associated with the purpose of the measure.
 Content validity, criterion validity and construct validity are explained.
 Sensitivity to rehabilitative interventions and significance in patients' real lives (ecological validity) are emphasized.
 Measures of functional outcomes (disability) may show improvement after rehabilitation even when impairment measures do not.
 An extensive but selected list of measures of coma, global status, disabilities, communicative and cognitive impairments, and handicaps is presented, and their main uses are illustrated.
 Examples illustrate how to choose measures to study comprehensive program-level outcomes, to study learning-based interventions and to develop a general purpose database.
 Although there are many measures of activities of daily living and mobility, little published evidence of reliability and validity could be found even for some well-known scales.
 Ecologically valid and sensitive outcome measures are especially needed.
 Studies of the clinical utility of measures were also scarce.
 Many of these gaps can be spanned by clinical researchers with limited resources.
 Physical medicine and rehabilitation will benefit from formal studies of the reliabilities and validities of both its old and its new measurement instruments and by increased sophistication in choice of measures.

1243,"Nonfearful panic disorder in neurology patients validated by lactate challenge.
 OBJECTIVE: Nonfearful panic disorder meets the DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder but is not associated with subjective fear and anxiety.
 The authors determined its prevalence in a group of neurology patients and assessed its diagnostic validity as a panic disorder subtype by evaluating the response of the patients with nonfearful panic disorder to sodium lactate and antipanic pharmacotherapy.
 METHOD: The subjects were all neurology patients referred over 1 year to a university hospital's psychiatric consultation service because of negative medical workups for their symptoms (N = 48).
 Patients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder but did not report subjective anxiety or fear during panic episodes were diagnosed as having nonfearful panic disorder.
 Afterward, each of those patients received a sodium lactate infusion and, 5 hours later, a sodium chloride infusion.
 They were then treated with antipanic medication and followed for at least 6 months.
 RESULTS: Of the 48 neurology patients referred for psychiatric evaluation, 11 (23%) met the criteria for panic disorder, and all 11 met the criteria for nonfearful panic disorder.
 All 11 responded positively to lactate but not to placebo, and they each experienced an at least 75% reduction in symptoms during the 6-month follow-up period.
 Detailed case reports of three of these patients are presented.
 CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the construct and predictive diagnostic validity of nonfearful panic disorder as a subtype of panic disorder and suggest that a lack of attention to this group leads to both the underestimation of the prevalence of panic disorder and to the withholding of potentially successful treatments for this group.

1244,"The management of primary pulmonary hypertension.
 Primary pulmonary hypertension is a clinical syndrome characterized by pulmonary hypertension in the absence of sufficient underlying cardiac, parenchymal pulmonary, or systemic disease to account for it.
 The population of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension is a heterogeneous one, both clinically and histologically.
 As the etiologic mechanisms are unknown, therapy is directed toward the consequences of the pulmonary vascular process.
 Oxygen supplementation, the use of digoxin and diuretics for symptomatic heart failure, and anticoagulation all may have a role in treating primary pulmonary hypertension, although vasodilator therapy has been the main area of investigation.
 Screening for vasodilator responsiveness, defining a favorable vasodilator effect, predicting long-term effectiveness, and deciding who to treat have all been controversial.
 New approaches, such as use of high-dose calcium channel-blocking agents and continuous intravenous infusion of prostacyclin (an investigational agent), have recently been proposed.
 When medical therapies are exhausted, heart-lung or lung transplantation has increasingly become an option for selected patients.

1245,"An application of probability theory to a group of breath-alcohol and blood-alcohol data.
 Many jurisdictions have ""per se"" driving-while-intoxicated (DWI) status expressed in terms of a blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) standard (in grams per 100 mL or the equivalent).
 Since breath-alcohol (BrAC) analysis is typically employed to determine BAC, there is often challenge to the use of an assumed 2100:1 conversion ratio.
 This concern may be relevant in light of considerable data that show a low percentage of cases in which BrAC greater than BAC, and this concern increases when the BrAC is used to predict BAC in the context of ""per se"" legislation.
 Probability theory provides a basis for estimating the likelihood of an individual having a BrAC greater than or equal to g/210 L with a corresponding BAC less than 0.10 g/100 mL.
 Actual field data from the state of Wisconsin (n = 404) were evaluated to determine the probability of this occurrence.
 The probability for this occurrence involves the multiplication law for independent events.
 The computed probability from the data was 0.018.
 The actual number of occurrences where BrAC greater than or equal to 0.10 g/210 L and BAC less than 0.10 g/100 mL was 5, resulting in a probability of 0.012.
 The concern of having BrAC greater than BAC at the critical ""per se"" level has a very low probability of occurrence, which thus supports the reasonableness of ""per se"" DWI legislation based upon a blood-alcohol standard determined by breath-alcohol analysis.

 The effectiveness of sucrose as an analgesic agent for newborn infants was assessed during two standard painful hospital procedures: blood collection via heel lance and circumcision.
 Infants who drank 2 mL of a 12% sucrose solution prior to blood collection cried 50% less during the blood collection procedure than did control infants who had received 2 mL of sterile water.
 Crying of infants who ingested sucrose returned to baseline levels within 30 to 60 seconds after blood collection whereas control infants required 2.5 to 3.0 minutes to return to baseline.
 Like findings were obtained for infants who received sucrose on a pacifier prior to and during circumcision.
 Specifically, control infants who underwent a standard circumcision procedure without intervention cried 67% of the time.
 A water-moistened pacifier reduced crying to 49% (P less than .01).
 Crying was reduced further to 31% (P less than .05) by providing infants with a sucrose-flavored pacifier to suck.
 These findings, which parallel results obtained in studies of pain in infant rats, provide a potent yet simple, benign intervention to help alleviate stress and pain routinely experienced by human infants.

 To determine the biologic basis of ts1 MoMuLV neurovirulence in vivo, newborn CFW/D mice were inoculated with neurovirulent ts1 MoMuLV and nonneurovirulent wt MoMuLV and the temporal response to virus infection in the central nervous system (CNS), spleen, and thymus was studied comparatively.
 Experimental procedures included single and double labeling in situ immunohistochemistry with selective morphometric analyses, and steady state immunoblotting of viral proteins.
 Cellular targets for virus infection were identical for both ts1 and wt MoMuLV and consisted sequentially of 1) splenic megakaryocytes, 2) splenic and thymic lymphocytes, 3) CNS capillary endothelial cells, and 4) CNS pericytes and microglia.
 Resident microglial cells served as the major reservor and amplifier of virus infection in the CNS of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice; a similar but much less significant role was played by microglia in wt MoMuLV-infected mice.
 The genesis and progression of severe spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice were both temporally and spatially correlated with amplified virus infection of microglia, and hyperplasia and hypertrophy of both virus-infected and nonvirus-infected microglial cells.
 Direct virus infection of neurons was never observed.
 The development of clinical neurologic disease and spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice correlated with the accumulation of both viral gag and env gene products in the CNS; there was no selective accumulation of env precursor polyprotein Pr80env.
 When compared to wt MoMuLV-infected mice, the neurovirulence of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice occurred by an enhanced ability to replicate in the CNS and to infect and activate more microglia, rather than by a fundamental change in cellular tropism or topography of virus infection.

 The DAT patients were significantly more impaired on measures of delayed verbal and figural episodic memory, and in addition showed a more rapid rate of decline on tests which depend upon the integrity of semantic knowledge (naming, number information, similarities and category fluency).
 In contrast, the HD patients were significantly worse, and showed a more rapid decline on the letter fluency test, a task especially sensitive to deficiencies in retrieval.
 The HD patients were also more impaired than DAT patients on a vocabulary test and on copying geometric figures.

 The relation between sodium and blood pressure is a centuries-old question.
 A substantial body of epidemiological and experimental data has accumulated that strongly implicates NaCl as having a causal role in the genesis of arterial hypertension.
 Prospective studies that have been performed in diverse populations that have manipulated NaCl exposure by diet or infusion have repeatedly documented an NaCl pressor effect.
 Further, similar studies in biracial populations have also demonstrated a greater prevalence of ""salt sensitivity"" in blacks compared with whites.
 The reasons for this observation are not entirely clear; however, intrinsic or hypertension-induced renal abnormalities that limit natriuretic capacity, reduced Na+,K(+)-ATPase pump activity, other membrane ion transport disturbances, differential exposure to psychological stressors, greater insulin resistance, and dietary factors (reduced Ca+ and K+ intake) have all been suggested as possibly playing a role.
 Salt sensitivity appears to be a widespread phenomenon.
 However, it is critically important to determine what factors account for racial differences in salt sensitivity.
 Moreover, the prevalence of salt sensitivity in the general population is unknown.
 Current definitions of salt sensitivity are varied and unidirectional.
 In comparison with bidirectional criteria (blood pressure increase with salt loading and blood pressure decrease with salt restriction), they are probably inadequate to identify salt-sensitive individuals who manifest less extreme blood pressure change after dietary sodium or plasma volume manipulations.
 More sensitive criteria for diagnosing salt sensitivity will facilitate a better understanding of racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of salt sensitivity.

 This report presents the results in our first clinical series of patients receiving continuous warm blood cardioplegia through the coronary sinus.
 Warm oxygenated blood cardioplegia has certain theoretical advantages, such as continuously supplying oxygen and substrates to the arrested heart while avoiding the side effects of hypothermia.
 Retrograde infusion of cardioplegia also offers certain advantages (eg, in valve operations and in patients with severe coronary artery disease) that are complementary to warm blood cardioplegia.
 Retrograde warm blood cardioplegia was used in 113 consecutive patients (85 men and 28 women with a mean age of 61 years) undergoing various procedures.
 Three percent of the patients died, 7% needed transient intraaortic balloon pump support, 6% had evidence of perioperative myocardial infarction, and 96% had spontaneous return of rhythm.
 There were no coronary sinus injuries.
 This new technique of retrograde continuous warm blood cardioplegia is a simple, safe, and reliable method of myocardial protection that may change the way we currently protect the heart intraoperatively.

 OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of milrinone on pulmonary vasculature.
 BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that bipyridines or their derivatives may have a selective pulmonary vasodilation effect.
 METHODS: Preliminary study: milrinone administration to 12 normal dogs (low dose [bolus 75 micrograms/kg for 5 min followed by a continuous infusion at 0.75 micrograms/kg.min, n = 6]; high dose [bolus 150 micrograms/kg for 5 min followed by continuous infusion at 1.5 micrograms/kg.min, n = 6]).
 Main study: milrinone administration to 18 dogs with pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary embolism induced by a massive injection of autologous muscle cubes.
 The pulmonary hypertension dogs were divided into three groups: a) group E (n = 6) received embolization only, as control; b) group L (n = 6) received low-dose milrinone; and c) group H (n = 6) received high-dose milrinone, equivalent to the preliminary study group.
 Hemodynamic measurements and blood samplings were obtained at baseline and at 15, 30, and 60 min after start of milrinone infusion.
 RESULTS: Milrinone did not change mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) in normal dogs.
 Milrinone decreased MPAP significantly in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.
 Pulmonary vascular resistance index remained at an almost constant level in normal dogs, but decreased significantly in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.
 Mean arterial pressure was maintained at a constant level in all groups.
 High-dose milrinone administration decreased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) significantly; low-dose milrinone administration decreased SVRI slightly.
 CONCLUSIONS: Milrinone may have a selective pulmonary vasodilatory effect only in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.
 The mechanism that produced a selectivity on pulmonary vasculature in dogs with pulmonary hypertension is unknown.
 However, an inhibition of platelet aggregation may decrease the MPAP resulting from an increase in cAMP caused by milrinone.
 Further studies are needed to resolve the pulmonary vasodilatory effect of milrinone in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.

 The effect of brief myocardial ischemia on the expression of heat shock protein (HSP 70) was examined in an in vivo rabbit model of myocardial ischemia using Northern blotting.
 Functional studies were carried out in the open-chested anesthetized rabbit.
 The large marginal branch of the left circumflex was occluded four times for 5 min.
 Using piezoelectric crystals implanted midwall in the ischemic zone, end-diastolic length, end-systolic length, and percent segmental shortening were assessed.
 Expression of HSP 70 was measured by Northern blotting.
 A single 5-min coronary occlusion doubled the expression of HSP 70 whereas four cycles of 5 min of ischemia/5 min of reperfusion resulted in a threefold increase in HSP 70 mRNA (P less than 0.001).
 Measurements with the piezoelectric crystals showed mild myocardial dysfunction concomitant with the increase in HSP 70.
 This increase in HSP 70 mRNA after repetitive brief ischemia was transient, occurring as early as 1 h and returning to baseline by 24 h after ischemia.

 The remaining 12 patients underwent sigmoidoscopy, diversion of the fecal stream with irrigation of the distal rectal stump, and radical initial debridement of necrotic soft tissue.
 Enteral access was obtained in two patients.
 In the patients with mandatory daily debridement and pulsatile irrigation, no pelvic sepsis occurred.

 Etoposide, a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, is increasingly used to treat cancer.
 Etoposide is a phase-specific, cytotoxic drug acting in the late S and early G2 phases of the cell cycle.
 It appears to cause breaks in DNA by either an interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals.
 Most studies show a biexponential decay after the intravenous (IV) administration of etoposide.
 The peak plasma concentrations of drug and the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) are linearly related to the IV dose.
 Considerable interpatient variability of pharmacokinetic variables exists after IV etoposide.
 Various metabolites of etoposide have been identified, but their detection and quantitation are disputed.
 Approximately 30% to 70% of an etoposide dose is excreted.
 The bioavailability of oral etoposide is approximately 50%, but its absorption is not linear with increasing doses within the range in clinical use.
 Considerable interpatient and intrapatient variability exists in the pharmacokinetics of oral etoposide.
 There is no evidence of etoposide accumulation after multiple consecutive doses by either the IV or oral route.
 The exact roles of the liver and kidney in metabolism and excretion of etoposide are uncertain.
 Etoposide has been shown to be a highly schedule-dependent drug in clinical studies.
 This, together with the phase-specific action of etoposide and its increasingly widespread use in treating cancer, makes the clinical pharmacology of this drug of great clinical importance.

1258,"Biohistory of slavery and blood pressure differences in blacks today. A hypothesis.
 Genetic factors are known to play an important role in the variations in blood pressure levels.
 However, genetic factors that explain the higher average blood pressure levels of western hemisphere blacks when compared with African blacks have not been seriously considered.
 Because the genetic makeup of a population is largely determined by biological and ecological forces in the past, an examination of the biohistory of blacks, specifically the slavery era, was conducted.
 An overview of the salient findings of that investigation is included in this article.
 The published historical evidence on the transatlantic slave trade and New World slavery (from the 16th century to the 19th century) reveals that conditions existed for ""natural selection,"" and therefore, genetic changes were virtually inevitable in the slave populations.
 During this period of history, mortality was extremely high, and fertility (or reproductive success) was so low among the survivors that most plantation societies in the western hemisphere depended on a constant importation of captives (over 12 million) from Africa for the viability of the plantation communities.
 Because the major causes of death were salt-depletive diseases such as diarrhea, fevers, and vomiting, it is argued that individuals with an enhanced genetic-based ability to conserve salt had a distinct survival advantage over others and were, therefore, more likely to bequeath their genotype to subsequent generations of Western hemisphere blacks.
 Thus, it is predicted that blacks in the Americas have a greater frequency of individuals with an enhanced genetic-based ability to conserve salt than African blacks.

 Approximately 60 million people in the United States have hypertension.
 More than half are either untreated or treated without blood pressure control, despite the well-known risks of hypertension and the established benefits of treatment.
 The major reason for inadequate control of hypertension is poor adherence to treatment.
 Approximately 50% of patients with hypertension fail to keep follow-up appointments, and only 60% take their medications as prescribed.
 Barriers to effective therapeutic adherence include poor doctor-patient communication, cost of antihypertensive therapy, and side effects of the drugs.
 To increase control of hypertension, compliance with therapy must be improved.
 Physicians and patients must be mutually committed to achieving control of blood pressure.
 Physicians should communicate instructions clearly and prescribe therapies that are effective, affordable, and have minimal or no adverse effects on patient quality of life or overall cardiac risk profile.
 The needs of special hypertensive populations (i.e., elderly, black, and young patients) must also be recognized and addressed.
 Patients must follow recommendations and alert their physicians to any problems with their medications--particularly those relating to side effects and cost.
 When selecting drug therapy it should be noted that older patients are sensitive to volume depletion and sympathetic inhibition.
 In this group of patients, initial drug doses should be low and increments smaller and more gradual than in younger patients.
 Black patients with hypertension show an accentuated response to diuretics and blunted responses to beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as monotherapy.
 However, when used with a diuretic, there are no racial differences in the blood pressure lowering effects of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors.

1264,"Activation of early events of the mitogenic response by a P2Y purinoceptor with covalently bound 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)-benzoyladenosine 5'-triphosphate.
 3'-O-(4-Benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP (BzATP), a photoaffinity analog of ATP, was used as a ligand for a P2Y purinoceptor (adenine nucleotide receptor) present in intact Swiss 3T3 and 3T6 cells and A-431 epidermoid carcinoma cells.
 Photolysis of serum-starved cells in the presence of 10-50 microM BzATP, followed by extensive washing to remove unincorporated BzATP, induced the release of arachidonic acid.
 A trace (less than 0.01%) of photoincorporated BzATP was as effective as when 50 microM BzATP or ATP was contained in the incubation medium during the assay.
 Photoincorporated BzATP also stimulated the production of prostaglandin E2 and the accumulation of cyclic AMP.
 In previous studies, we demonstrated that these three events are obligatory early steps in a pathway leading to DNA synthesis in the above cell lines.
 The evidence indicated that the purinoceptor activated by extracellular ATP or BzATP was linked to a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein.
 Consistent with these observations, we now find that pertussis toxin inhibits the effect of photoincorporated BzATP on arachidonic acid release.
 These results indicate that BzATP is an effective agonist for the P2Y purinoceptor concerned with stimulation of DNA synthesis in 3T3, 3T6, and A-431 cells.
 Furthermore, after photolysis it becomes irreversibly associated with intact cells and promotes the activation of early events required for DNA synthesis.

1265,"Alterations in left ventricular diastolic twist mechanics during acute human cardiac allograft rejection.
 BACKGROUND.
 Contraction of obliquely oriented left ventricular (LV) fibers results in a twisting motion of the left ventricle.
 The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of acute human cardiac allograft rejection on LV twist pattern and the twist-volume relation.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Tantalum markers were implanted into the LV midwall in 15 transplant recipients to measure time-varying, three-dimensional chamber twist using computer-assisted analysis of biplane cinefluoroscopic images.
 Twist was defined as the mean longitudinal gradient of circumferential rotation about the LV long axis.
 When plotted against normalized percent ejection fraction (%EF), the resulting twist-normalized %EF relation could be divided into three phases.
 In systole, LV twist was linearly related to ejection of blood.
 In contrast, diastolic untwist was characterized by early rapid recoil with little change in LV volume, followed by more gradual untwisting when the bulk of diastolic filling occurred.
 During 10 acute rejection episodes in 10 patients, maximum twist, peak systolic twist rate, and the slope of the systolic twist-normalized %EF relation did not change.
 In contrast, the slope of the early (first 15% of filling) diastolic twist-normalized %EF relation (M(early-dia)) decreased significantly (-0.194 +/- 0.062 [prerejection] versus -0.103 +/- 0.054 rad/cm [rejection], p = 0.0003), resulting in a prolonged tau 1/2 (time required to untwist by 50% [20 +/- 5% versus 28 +/- 5% of diastole], p = 0.0003) and decrease in percent untwisting at 15% diastolic LV filling (62 +/- 11% versus 36 +/- 13%, p = 0.0003).
 Therefore, a greater proportion of LV untwisting occurred later in diastole during rejection, as reflected by an increase in the slope (M(mid-dia)) of the middle to late (from 15 to 90% filling) diastolic twist-normalized %EF relation (-0.018 +/- 0.009 versus -0.030 +/- 0.010 rad/cm, p = 0.0015).
 Peak rate of untwist was not affected.
 With resolution of rejection, M(early-dia) and percent untwist during early diastole returned to baseline levels (p = NS versus baseline).
 There was also a trend for M(mid-dia) to return toward prerejection values (p = NS versus baseline), but this change did not reach statistical significance compared with rejection values.
 CONCLUSION.
 Acute cardiac allograft rejection is associated with altered diastolic twist mechanics in the absence of any demonstratable systolic abnormalities.
 During rejection, myocardial edema and other factors may result in intrinsic changes of the elastic properties of the myocardium, thereby leading to modification of recoil forces responsible for the early, rapid unwinding of the deformed ventricle.

1266,"Synergistic inhibition by verapamil and quinine of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance in a human myeloma cell line model.
 In an effort to develop a clinically useful approach to overcoming P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR1), we evaluated combined chemosensitization with verapamil and quinine in a multidrug-resistant (MDR) human myeloma cell line model.
 In clonogenic assay, verapamil was used at concentrations from 0.1 to 1.0 micrograms/mL, bracketing the plasma levels achieved by oral administration and high-dose intravenous (IV) infusion, respectively.
 The dose of quinine was held constant at 1.0 micrograms/mL, a plasma concentration readily achieved by oral administration.
 At each dose level of verapamil tested, the combination with quinine proved more effective than either drug individually in reversing resistance to doxorubicin and vinblastine and synergistic chemosensitizing interaction was observed.
 Verapamil at 0.1 microgram/mL combined with quinine was capable of restoring sensitivity to doxorubicin fully and reduced resistance to vinblastine as effectively as verapamil alone at 1.0 micrograms/mL.
 Furthermore, the combination of 1.0 mumol verapamil with 10 mumols quinine increased accumulation and retention of anthracycline in the resistant cells to a greater extent than did either drug individually (P less than .001) and inhibited drug efflux as effectively as verapamil alone at 10 mumols.
 Our findings suggest that combined chemosensitization with verapamil and quinine may prove useful for overcoming MDR1 in patients with drug-refractory B-cell neoplasms such as multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

1268,"Activation of erythropoietin receptors by Friend viral gp55 and by erythropoietin and down-modulation by the murine Fv-2r resistance gene.
 The leukemogenic membrane glycoprotein (gp55) encoded by Friend spleen focus-forming virus appears to bind to erythropoietin receptors (EpoR) sto stimulate erythroblastosis [Li, J.-P., D'Andrea, A.D., Lodish, H.F.
 & Baltimore, D.
 (1990) Nature (London) 343, 762-764].
 To directly compare the effects of gp55 with erythropoietin (Epo), we produced retrovirions that encode either gp55, Epo, or EpoR.
 After infection with EpoR virus, interleukin 3-dependent DA-3 cells bound 125I-labeled Epo and grew without interleukin 3 in the presence of Epo.
 These latter cells, but not parental DA-3 cells, became factor-independent after superinfection either with Epo virus or with Friend spleen focus-forming virus.
 In addition, Epo virus caused a disease in mice that mimicked Friend erythroleukemia.
 Although Fv-2r homozygotes are susceptible to all other retroviral diseases, they are resistant to both Epo viral and Friend viral erythroleukemias.
 These results indicate that both gp55 and Epo stimulate EpoR and that the Fv-2 gene encodes a protein that controls response to these ligands.
 However, the Fv-2 protein is not EpoR because the corresponding genes map to opposite ends of mouse chromosome 9.
 These results have important implications for understanding signal transduction by EpoR and the role of host genetic variation in controlling susceptibility to an oncogenic protein.

1269,"Reduced dependency on arteriography for penetrating extremity trauma: influence of wound location and noninvasive vascular studies.
 Indications for arteriography in penetrating extremity trauma remain controversial.
 We reviewed our clinical experience in 454 patients (514 extremities) with penetrating trauma admitted during a prior 3 1/2-year period.
 Injuries were caused by stab wounds in 60 (11.7%) extremities and by gunshot wounds in 454 (88.3%) extremities.
 Thirty-three of the 60 stab wounds (55%) required urgent exploration, and 27 underwent arteriography.
 No arteriograms were positive for unsuspected arterial injury in this group.
 Forty-two of 454 gunshot wounds (9.3%) underwent mandatory exploration; arteriograms were performed on 412 extremities.
 Forty-four arteriograms (10.7%) demonstrated evidence of unsuspected arterial injuries.
 During the last year, randomly selected extremities (n = 23) have been studied with B-mode ultrasonography and segmental Doppler pressure measurements.
 Using the subsequent arteriography as the ""gold"" standard, sensitivity was 83% and specificity was 100%.
 Gunshot wounds were categorized according to location and positive arteriograms.
 Injuries to the lateral thigh and arm resulted in no positive arteriograms, while positive studies were observed in 11% of medial and posterior arm, 14% of antecubital fossa, 25% of forearm, 7.5% of medial and posterior thigh, 8% of popliteal fossa, and 26% of calf injuries.
 We recommend arteriography for gunshot injuries to identified high-risk areas, while clinical evaluation alone is accurate in all stab wounds to the extremities and gunshot wounds to the lateral thigh and outer arm.
 Preliminary data suggest expanded use of B-mode ultrasonography may further reduce our dependency on arteriography in these cases.

 Previously we reported that lithium chloride (LiCl) potentiates tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo.
 Here, using a murine normal skin model, it is shown that a subcutaneous injection of TNF plus LiCl induces acute dermal and subcutaneous inflammation and necrosis.
 Histology showed a marked initial dermal and subcutaneous neutrophil infiltrate by approximately 2 hours, followed by a predominantly mononuclear infiltrate by 24 hours, which remained present for several days.
 Tumor necrosis factor or LiCl alone induced negligible inflammation, disappearing after 6 hours; furthermore there was never necrosis or ulceration of the overlying skin in case of single-agent application.
 In vitro studies showed that the combination of TNF and LiCl, but not either agent alone, was directly cytotoxic to fibroblastic cells of murine skin.
 No inflammatory infiltration was visible in tumors treated intratumorally or perilesionally with TNF plus LiCl, although the latter treatment resulted in a perilesional leukocyte infiltration.
 Furthermore the combination of TNF and LiCl had no effect on macrophage cytotoxicity to L929 tumors.

 Rehabilitation robotics is a research area, originating in engineering, that has emerged in the last decade.
 Its broad aim is to use robot technology to assist people with movement dysfunction.
 The neurologically impaired population might gain considerably from the provision of robots as ""assistants"" or ""therapy aides,"" but the interface with the machine must match both the physical and intellectual abilities of the user.
 We therefore consider a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing both behavioral and engineering perspectives, to be essential in achieving this aim.

 This article seeks to introduce physical therapists to robotics, describe possible applications to the rehabilitation of neurologically impaired patients, and suggest issues deserving further investigation.

 In a series of fourteen patients with adult T-cell lymphoma-leukaemia (ATLL) in Brazil the main features were lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, hypercalcaemia, and high leucocyte counts, with abnormal lymphoid cells which had irregular nuclei.
 The series included the youngest patient with ATLL so far (18 months).
 Analysis with monoclonal antibodies showed a mature T-cell phenotype (CD4+, CD8-).
 Antibodies to HTLV-I and/or integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA were found in eleven patients.
 In the other three HTLV-I DNA could not be demonstrated even by means of the polymerase chain reaction; they therefore had HTLV-I-negative ATLL.
 This report of ATLL in Brazil corroborates serological reports that HTLV-I may be endemic in some parts of that country.

 Potassium loss from damaged myocardial cells is linearly related to CPK enzyme loss reflecting extent of necrosis.
 The potassium analog, rubidium-82 (82Rb), is extracted after i.v.
 injection and retained in viable myocardium but is not trapped or washed out of necrotic regions.
 To compare myocardial cell metabolism with membrane dysfunction as indicators of necrosis/viability, 43 patients with evolving myocardial infarction and coronary arteriography had positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and the potassium analog 82Rb.
 Percent of heart showing FDG defects and 82Rb washout on sequential images indicating failure to retain the potassium analogue were visually assessed and quantified by automated software.
 Infarct size based on rubidium kinetics correlated closely with size and location on FDG images (visual r = 0.93, automated r = 0.82), suggesting that loss of cell membrane integrity for trapping the potassium analog 82Rb parallels loss of intracellular glucose metabolism, both comparable quantitative markers of myocardial necrosis/viability.

 In normal breast tissue and in noninvasive breast carcinomas, various keratin-14 antibodies were reactive predominantly with the basal/myoepithelial cell layer, although mainly in terminal and larger ducts luminal cells sometimes also were stained.
 A similar reaction pattern was found with an antibody directed against keratin 17, although this antibody was more often found negative than keratin 14 in the pre-existing myoepithelial cells in intraductal carcinomas.
 Furthermore antibodies reactive with hyperproliferation-related keratins 6 and 16 were used.
 One of these (LL025) was completely negative in normal breast tissue and noninvasive breast carcinomas.
 However 10% of the invasive carcinomas were diffusely or focally positive with this latter antibody, while in 18 of 115 cases of invasive breast carcinomas studied, a basal cell phenotype was detected.
 A relatively high concordance was found between the carcinomas immunostaining with the basal cell and the hyperproliferation-related keratins, but not between these markers and the proliferation marker Ki-67.
 This supports the conclusion that basal cells in breast cancer may show extensive proliferation, and that absence of Ki-67 staining does not mean that (tumor) cells are not proliferating.

 In 20 women with breast carcinoma, 17 of whom had locally advanced cancer and 3 of whom had confirmed metastases, the expression of P-glycoprotein was evaluated before the start of a chemotherapy regimen that included multidrug resistance-related drugs.
 With the use of the C494 monoclonal antibody in an avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique, P-glycoprotein was detected in 17 of 20 tumor samples.
 Results were expressed in a semiquantitative manner, taking into account the number of positive tumor cells (N index) and the specific staining intensity (I index).
 The 17 patients with nonmetastatic cancer were followed from the first cycle of chemotherapy to cancer recurrence; subsequent to six cycles of chemotherapy, all of these patients except one were rendered clinically disease-free through surgery and/or radiation.
 The end point was defined as either local/regional recurrence or metastasis.
 Strong P-glycoprotein-positive staining in a majority of tumor cells (the N+/I+ phenotype) was significantly correlated with no initial response to chemotherapy (P less than .02) and with a shorter progression-free survival (P less than .02).

 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a minimally invasive procedure whereby the gallbladder is removed using laparoscopic techniques.
 The indications are similar to those for elective traditional cholecystectomy, but selection of patients is important for success.
 Contraindications are currently evolving.
 Patients with advanced cholecystitis, abdominal sepsis, ileus, bleeding disorders, pregnancy, and morbid obesity should not undergo this procedure.
 The procedure requires good traditional surgical skills, as well as additional laparoscopic (and laser) skills.
 Operative time is slightly longer than for traditional cholecystectomy, but decreases with experience.
 Morbidity is low, but there is a concern about bile duct injuries.
 Mortality is very low (0%) and is comparable to traditional cholecystectomy (0.4%).

1283,"Identification of viable myocardium in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Comparison of thallium scintigraphy with reinjection and PET imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose 
 In patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, the distinction between ventricular dysfunction arising from myocardial fibrosis and ischemic, but viable, myocardium has important clinical implications.
 By positron emission tomography (PET), enhanced fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in myocardial segments with impaired function and reduced blood flow is evidence of myocardial viability.
 Reinjection of thallium-201 at rest immediately after stress-redistribution imaging may also provide evidence of myocardial viability by demonstrating thallium uptake in regions with apparently ""irreversible"" defects.
 To compare these two methods, we studied 16 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction, 27 +/- 9%), all of whom had irreversible defects on standard exercise-redistribution thallium single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging.
 Thallium was reinjected immediately after the redistribution study, and SPECT images were reacquired.
 The patients also underwent PET imaging with FDG and oxygen-15-labeled water.
 A total of 432 myocardial segments were analyzed from comparable transaxial tomograms, of which 166 (38%) had irreversible thallium defects on redistribution images before reinjection.
 FDG uptake was demonstrated in 121 (73%) of these irreversible defects.
 Irreversible defects were then subgrouped according to the degree of thallium activity, relative to peak activity in normal regions.
 Irreversible defects with only mild (60-85% of peak activity) or moderate (50-59% of peak) reduction in thallium activity were considered viable on the basis of FDG uptake in 91% and 84% of these segments, respectively.
 In contrast, in irreversible defects with severe reduction in thallium activity (less than 50% of peak), FDG uptake was present in 51% of segments.
 In such severe defects, an identical number of segments (51%) demonstrated enhanced uptake of thallium after reinjection.
 In these severe ""irreversible"" defects, data on myocardial viability were concordant by the two techniques in 88% of segments, with 45% identified as viable and 43% identified as scar on both PET and thallium reinjection studies.
 These observations suggest that thallium imaging can be used to identify viable myocardium in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction.
 Most irreversible defects with only mild or moderate reduction in thallium activity represent viable myocardium as confirmed by FDG uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

 As a control for a possible reaction to foreign protein, in group 3 the sutured anastomosis was sealed with specially prepared rat fibrin adhesive.
 On days 2, 4 and 7, ten animals in each group were killed.

 Adhesion formation was significantly increased in groups 2 and 3 compared with the control group.
 On days 2 and 7 the bursting pressure was not different between the groups.

 To develop a model for health policy decisions, we examined all trauma admissions to acute care hospitals in the state of California in the year 1986.
 We looked at the influence of the following host factors: age, gender, and preinjury medical conditions, on mortality stratified by injury severity.
 The study group (N = 199,737) had an overall mortality rate of 1.9%.
 Mortality increased starting at age 40 years and was independently influenced by gender, the presence of pre-existing disease, and the body region injured.
 In patients with minor injury, mortality rates became higher in the elderly at age 65+.
 However, in patients with injuries of moderate severity, mortality increased in both middle age (40-64) and elderly groups (65+).
 Male gender was also a risk factor, present in both the elderly and middle age groups.
 While the presence of both pre-existing medical disease or injury to head or abdomen was related to increased mortality in middle-aged patients at all severity levels, neither accounted for the effect of gender.
 Conclusion.
 Age and gender influence mortality in trauma patients.
 These effects are not explained by documented pre-existing disease or region of injury.
 Age and gender serve only as observable markers for subgroups of patients with impaired response to injury.
 Middle-aged males comprise a previously unrecognized high-risk subgroup for this impaired response.

 Calcium channel blockers, originally developed for the treatment of angina and supraventricular arrhythmias, have been shown to lower elevated blood pressure effectively in hypertensive patients.
 Verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem represent prototype compounds for unique chemical classes with differing pharmacologic properties.
 These drugs lower elevated blood pressure with efficacy comparable with other commonly used antihypertensives.
 Combination therapy with other agents usually results in an additive response.
 Side effects are usually mild and reversible and usually are an extension of the drug's pharmacologic effects.
 Moreover, adverse metabolic effects on lipid, glucose, or potassium levels are not common.
 Because of the excellent antihypertensive effects of calcium channel blockers and their potential importance in a variety of other disease states, these agents should be routinely considered for use as a first-line antihypertensive agent in appropriately selected patients with hypertension of any severity as part of a comprehensive plan to minimize cardiovascular risk.

1291,"Abnormal pattern detected in fragile-X patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
 The fragile-X syndrome is the most frequent inherited form of mental retardation, with an incidence of 1 in 1,500 males.
 It is characterized by the presence of a fragile site at Xq27.3 induced in vitro by folate deprivation or by inhibitors of deoxynucleotide synthesis.
 Its mode of inheritance is unusual for an X-linked trait, with incomplete penetrance in both males and females.
 Some phenotypically normal males transmit the mutation to all their daughters who rarely express any symptoms, but penetrance is high in sons and daughters of these carrier women.
 Genetic and physical mapping of the Xq27-q28 region has confirmed that the disease locus is located at or very near the fragile site.
 Hypotheses proposed to account for the abnormalities in the inheritance of the disease include sequence rearrangements by meiotic recombination or a mutation that affects reactivation of an inactive X chromosome during differentiation of female germ cells.
 To detect such rearrangements, or methylation changes that may reflect a locally inactive X chromosome, we used pulsed-field gel analysis of DNA from fragile-X patients with probes close to the fragile-X locus.
 The probe Do33 (DXS465) detected abnormal patterns in fragile-X patients, but not in normal controls or in non-expressing male transmitters.

1292,"Quadriceps myopathy: forme fruste of Becker muscular dystrophy.
 We examined dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene, in muscle biopsy specimens from 4 male patients with quadriceps myopathy, all of whom showed a mild and slowly progressive myopathy confined to the quadriceps muscles.
 All 4 patients had clear abnormalities of dystrophin, and were diagnosed as having Becker muscular dystrophy by both immunofluorescence and immunoblot examinations; that is, dystrophin of an abnormal molecular mass was visualized in muscle cryosections as ""patchy"" or discontinuous immunostaining at the surface membrane of the muscle fibers.
 One patient had a brother who showed widespread myopathic changes consistent with typical Becker muscular dystrophy.
 We conclude that the syndrome called quadriceps myopathy includes a group of forme fruste Becker muscular dystrophy.

1293,"Twelve-year incidence of coronary heart disease in middle-aged adults during the era of hypertensive therapy: the Framingham offspring study [published erratum appears in Am J Med 1991 Apr;90(4):537]
 PURPOSE: To provide information on the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the offspring of the original cohort from the Framingham Heart Study.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1972 to 1974, offspring of the original participants in the Framingham Heart Study underwent a baseline examination for standard cardiovascular risk factors.
 At entry into the study, these offspring were 30 to 59 years old and free of CHD.
 They were followed for 12 years, during which time 156 of 1,663 men and 55 of 1,714 women developed CHD.
 RESULTS: In a multivariate proportional hazards model, CHD was significantly associated with age, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and number of cigarettes smoked.
 Fasting glucose levels and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were highly associated with CHD in men, but borderline in women, while triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not significantly associated with CHD after adjustment for HDL-C and glucose.
 Blood pressure medication was used in half of the hypertensive individuals, and systolic pressure was associated with CHD in women only.
 CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the importance of the common CHD risk factors of cigarette smoking and LDL-C, and extends the prognostic role of HDL-C in a middle-aged cohort.
 The impact of blood pressure, with or without use of hypertensive medications, was reduced in this study, and the data suggest that this attenuation was due to successful treatment.

1294,"Prediction of the frequency and duration of ambulatory myocardial ischemia in patients with stable coronary artery disease by determination of the ischemic threshold from exercise testing: importance of the exercise protocol 
 The relation between ambulatory myocardial ischemia and the results of exercise testing in patients with ischemic heart disease remains undefined, because of the dissimilar results of previous reports.
 To further investigate this issue and, in particular, to ascertain the importance of the exercise protocol in determining that relation, 70 patients with stable coronary artery disease underwent 48 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and treadmill exercise tests after withdrawal of medications.
 Patients exercised using two different protocols with slow (National Institutes of Health [NIH] combined protocol) and brisk (Bruce protocol) work load increments.
 Exercise duration was longer with the NIH combined protocol (14.1 +/- 5 versus 6.8 +/- 2 min; p less than 0.0001), but the maximal work load and peak heart rate achieved were greater with the Bruce protocol (9.8 +/- 2 versus 6.5 +/- 2 METs, and 142 +/- 19 versus 133 +/- 22 beats/min, respectively; p less than 0.0001).
 A close inverse correlation between exercise testing and the results of ambulatory ECG monitoring was observed using the NIH combined protocol; the strongest correlation was observed between time of exercise at 1 mm of ST segment depression and number of ischemic episodes (r = -0.86; p less than 0.0001).
 With the Bruce protocol a significantly weaker inverse correlation was found (r = -0.35).
 The mean heart rate at the onset of ST segment depression was similar during monitoring and during exercise testing with the NIH combined protocol (97.2 +/- 13 versus 101.0 +/- 17 beats/min, respectively) but it was significantly higher (110.4 +/- 13) when using the Bruce protocol (p less than 0.001).

 To assess the prognostic significance of thallium-201 perfusion defects in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), 43 patients underwent thallium scintigraphy in addition to clinical, echocardiographic, angiographic and hemodynamic evaluation.
 Eleven patients had no significant thallium perfusion abnormality, 19 had multiple small defects and 13 had a large defect.
 During 3.2 +/- 2.2 years, 14 patients had disease-related mortality.
 The patients who died had a higher incidence of ventricular tachycardia (71 vs 31%; p less than 0.02), increased cardiothoracic ratio (60 +/- 6 vs 54 +/- 6; p = 0.005), decreased fractional shortening (11 +/- 6 vs 15 +/- 5; p less than 0.05), increased pulmonary wedge pressure (15 +/- 7 vs 10 +/- 6 mm Hg; p = 0.05), increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (21 +/- 8 vs 14 +/- 6 mm Hg; p = 0.02) and abnormal thallium perfusion defects (13 of 14 vs 16 of 26; p less than 0.05) compared with survivors.
 Age, gender, left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions, cardiac index and ejection fraction were not statistically different in the survivors versus the patients who died.

 CTL clones were developed from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from the ascites of a patient with ovarian carcinoma by coculture of TIL with autologous tumor cells and subsequent cloning in the presence of autologous tumor cells.
 These CTL clones expressed preferential cytolytic activity against autologous tumor cells but not against allogeneic ovarian tumor cells and the NK-sensitive cell line K562.
 The cytolytic activity of these CTL against autologous tumors was inhibited by anti-TCR (WT31 mAb), anti-HLA class I, and anti-CD3 mAb but not by the NK function antibody Leu 11b.
 Cloning of the autologous tumor cells in vitro revealed that the CTL clones of the ovarian TIL expressed differential abilities to lyse autologous tumor cell clones.
 The specificity analysis of these autologous tumor specific CTL suggested that they recognize several antigenic determinants present on the ovarian tumor cells.
 Our results indicate the presence of at least three antigenic epitopes on the tumor cells (designated OVA-1A, OVA-1B, and OVA-1C), one of which (OVA-1C) is unstable.
 These determinants are present either simultaneously or separately, and six types of ovarian clones can be distinguished on the basis of their expression.
 These results indicate that CTL of the TIL detect intratumor antigenic heterogeneity.
 The novel heterogeneity identified within the ovarian tumor cells in this report may be of significance for understanding cellular immunity in ovarian cancer and developing adoptive specific immunotherapeutic approaches in ovarian cancer.

 The effects of hydralazine and prostaglandin E1 on regional myocardial function were studied in dogs.
 Sixteen dogs were randomly assigned to one of two drug treatment groups of eight dogs each.
 The first group (G1) was treated with 0.4 mg/kg hydralazine administered as a bolus.
 The second group (G2) received prostaglandin E1 given as an infusion for a total dose of 0.8 micrograms/kg.
 Regional myocardial function was assessed through the measurement of myocardial segment shortening during systole.
 We call this index percent systolic shortening (%SS).
 An ischemic heart preparation was created by partial occlusion of coronary blood flow.
 The degree of induced ischemia was determined by following the reduction in %SS.
 Hydralazine reduced %SS of the ischemic myocardium while increasing the cardiac index, stroke volume index, and coronary blood flow.
 Prostaglandin E1 increased %SS, cardiac index, and stroke volume index in the ischemic heart preparation.
 Hydralazine, therefore, induced dissociation between global ventricular function and regional myocardial function whereas prostaglandin E1 did not.
 The present findings emphasize that evaluation of vasoactive drugs should consider their effects on regional myocardial function as well as on global hemodynamics.

 Adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and associated thromboxane B2 release were studied in 52 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to detect a possible association between altered platelet function and development of cerebral ischemic complications after SAH.
 Compared to the values on admission, the patients showed significantly increased platelet aggregability (p less than 0.05) and thromboxane release (p less than 0.001) 1 to 2 weeks after SAH.
 The highest values of thromboxane release were seen in patients who deteriorated due to delayed cerebral ischemia with a permanent neurological deficit.
 Thromboxane release was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) before the onset of severe delayed ischemia in six patients with preoperative ischemia compared to the patients without delayed ischemia.
 In five others, both ischemic deterioration and elevated thromboxane release occurred after operation.
 These patients had preoperative values similar to the values in those without ischemic symptoms.
 The observations suggest that increased platelet aggregability and thromboxane release are associated with delayed cerebral ischemia both before and after surgery.

 The dystonia began 1 to 4 days after the trauma and differed clinically from idiopathic torticollis by marked limitation of range of motion, lack of improvement after sleep (""honeymoon period""), and absence of geste antagonistique.
 Worsening with action was not present; nor was there improvement with support as seen with idiopathic torticollis.
 Onset of pain immediately after the trauma and marked spasms of the paracervical muscles were other predominant features.
 Anticholinergic therapy was without benefit; however, some improvement occurred with botulinum toxin injection.

 Although most respondents endorsed the inclusion of both required and elective alcohol and drug education in the curriculum, few programs that did not include it already had a future plan for it.
 Major impediments identified were curriculum time constraints (86% medical student level, 68% resident level) and the lack of a qualified instructor (55% medical student level, 50% resident level).

 Expression of nm23 has been detected in human breast tumors by means of hybridization and immunocytochemistry.
 We measured nm23 mRNA in 71 patients with primary breast cancer and found variable levels of nm23 expression.
 The nm23 gene was expressed at higher levels in well-differentiated tumors (P less than .02).
 There was a significant inverse relationship between nm23 expression and nodal status (P less than .02).
 Expression of nm23 was positively associated with longer disease-free survival and overall survival, and the relationships were significant (P less than .002 and P less than .003, respectively).
 This study showed that nm23 expression in human breast cancer was associated with good prognosis and a lack of lymph node metastasis and suggests that the nm23 gene product may play an important role in suppressing the metastatic phenotype.

 Women had higher fibrinogen levels than men.
 In both sexes, multivariate analysis showed that fibrinogen was positively associated with age, smoking, total cholesterol and body mass index and negatively associated with alcohol consumption.
 Among women, early menopause and systolic blood pressure were also associated with fibrinogen levels.
 Univariate analyses showed weak positive associations with fish consumption for both sexes although only male white fish consumption entered the final model.
 Women with a history of contraceptive pill usage had significantly lower fibrinogen levels.
 The relationship between fibrinogen and physical activity was complex, and could largely be explained by smoking.
 These findings support the hypothesis that raised fibrinogen is one mechanism by which several major risk factors may promote coronary heart disease.
 However, known risk factors explained, at most, 10% of the total variance in fibrinogen levels among the general population.

1307,"Glucose-induced exertional fatigue in muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency 
 BACKGROUND.
 The exercise capacity of patients with muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency is low and fluctuates from day to day.
 The basis of this variable exercise tolerance is unknown, but our patients with this disorder report that fatigue of active muscles is more rapid after a high-carbohydrate meal.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 To determine the effect of carbohydrate on exercise performance, we asked four patients with muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency to perform cycle exercise under conditions of differing availability of substrate--i.e., after an overnight fast, and during an infusion of glucose or triglyceride (with 10 U of heparin per kilogram of body weight) after an overnight fast.
 As compared with fasting and the infusion of triglyceride with heparin, the glucose infusion lowered plasma levels of free fatty acids and ketones, reduced maximal work capacity by 60 to 70 percent, and lowered maximal oxygen consumption by 30 to 40 percent.
 Glucose also increased the relative intensity of submaximal exercise, as indicated by a higher heart rate at a given workload during exercise.
 The maximal cardiac output (i.e., oxygen delivery) was not affected by varying substrate availability, but the maximal systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference was significantly lower during glucose infusion (mean +/- SE, 5.5 +/- 0.3 ml per deciliter) than after fasting (7.6 +/- 0.4 ml per deciliter, P less than 0.05) or during the infusion of triglyceride with heparin (8.9 +/- 1.3 ml per deciliter, P less than 0.05).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 In muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency, the oxidative capacity of muscle and the capacity for aerobic exercise vary according to the availability of blood-borne fuels.
 We believe that glucose infusion lowers exercise tolerance by inhibiting lipolysis and thus depriving muscle of oxidative substrate (plasma free fatty acids and ketones); this impairs the capacity of working muscle to extract oxygen and lowers maximal oxygen consumption.

 In Taiwan, hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the major malignancies in children between 5 and 14 yr of age.
 We studied the status of hepatitis B virus DNA in the hepatocellular carcinoma and nontumorous liver tissues of eight children with positive serum HBsAg and maternal HBsAg.
 The hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from five of the eight children showed integration of hepatitis B virus DNA into host cellular DNA sequences.
 A pattern of single-site integration in four children and a multiple-site integration pattern in one child were demonstrated.
 In the remaining three children, hepatitis B virus DNA could not be demonstrated in the tumor tissues.
 Using subgenomic fragments of the hepatitis B virus genome as probes, we found that the X gene fragment and the surface antigen gene fragment were the most conserved sequences.
 The single-site integration of hepatitis B virus DNA in childhood hepatocellular carcinoma may have hit the critical region, resulting in insertional mutagenesis and early development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
 With a short incubation period and less exposure to environmental carcinogens during early life, childhood hepatocellular carcinoma may provide a good model to study the carcinogenic potential of hepatitis B virus.

 From 1977 to 1987, 1705 thermally injured patients were admitted to the Firefighters' Burn Center at the University of Alberta Hospitals.

 Sixteen hundred thirty-five patients survived to be discharged from hospital, with an overall survival rate of 95.9%.
 One hundred twenty-four burn patients (7.3%) suffered concomitant inhalation injury diagnosed by bronchoscopy.
 Patients with inhalation injury suffered from larger TBSA (39.7% +/- 2.8% versus 12.2% +/- 0.3%; p less than 0.01) than those without inhalation injury.
 Inhalation injury increased the number of deaths from burn injury (34.7% versus 1.7%; p less than 0.01) independent of age and TBSA.
 Inhalation injury was associated with a threefold prolongation of hospital stay (23.7 +/- 0.7 versus 74.4 +/- 6.2 days; p less than 0.01) and was independent of age and TBSA.
 Multifactorial probit analysis was performed for both inhalation- and noninhalation-injured burned patients to allow TBSA and age adjusted rates of mortality for the burn population presented.
 The maximum detrimental effects of inhalation injury in burn patient outcome occurred when it coexisted with moderate (15% to 29% TBSA) to large (30% to 69% TBSA) thermal injuries.
 These data demonstrate that inhalation injury is an important comorbid factor in burn injury that increases the number of deaths substantially.
 Most importantly such injuries also independently prolong the duration of hospitalization in a highly unpredictable fashion as compared to patients with cutaneous burns only.
 As such our data illustrate the extreme importance of inhalation injury as a comorbid factor following thermal injury and reveal the present limitations for accurate quantification of the magnitude of respiratory tract injury accompanying thermal trauma.

 All patients underwent MRI and radionuclide ventriculography, performed consecutively on the same day (mean time interval between the 2 examinations: 40 minutes).
 Comparison with LVEF showed a high correlation (y = 0.79 X +3.51, r = 0.91; p less than 0.001).
 Mean difference between radionuclide ventriculography and MRI data was 1.7, with the 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 2.68: MRI slightly underestimated LVEF.

 High levels of cardiac risk factors tend to cluster together and act synergistically.
 To develop a suitable and practical marker for clustering, we evaluated 380 consecutive patients at the time of coronary angiography.
 Analyses of lipid, rheologic, clinical and arteriographic profiles indicated a variety of interwoven relations.
 Because the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (total/HDL cholesterol) was closely related to both the presence and extent of greater than or equal to 50% diameter reduction of greater than or equal to 1 coronary arteries, it was used to divide patients into quartiles.
 Clustering of high- and low-level risk factors was demonstrated in the highest and lowest quartiles of total/HDL cholesterol, respectively (p less than 0.001).
 The highest quartile may be characterized by an only moderately elevated total cholesterol level but patients in this quartile may have a very low HDL cholesterol level, high triglycerides, a tendency toward high hemoglobin and fibrinogen levels, a history of smoking, previous myocardial infarction and multivessel disease.
 These results suggest that total/HDL cholesterol serves as a marker not only for obstructive coronary disease but also for a cluster of potentially modifiable risk factors.

 For regular NSAID use that continued into the year before interview, the multivariate relative risk estimate was 0.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.8); the estimate decreased as the duration of use increased, but the trend was not statistically significant.
 Similar results were obtained whether cancer or non-cancer controls were used, and the inverse association was apparent for both colon cancer and rectal cancer in men and women and in subjects younger and older than 60 years.

 The function of the c-Myc oncoprotein and its role in cell growth control is unclear.
 A basic region of c-Myc is structurally related to the basic motifs of helix-loop-helix (HLH) and leucine zipper proteins, which provide sequence-specific DNA binding function.
 The c-Myc basic region was tested for its ability to bind DNA by attaching it to the HLH dimerization interface of the E12 enhancer binding factor.
 Dimers of the chimeric protein, termed E6, specifically bound an E box element (GGCCACGTGACC) recognized by other HLH proteins in a manner dependent on the integrity of the c-Myc basic motif.
 Methylation of the core CpG in the E box recognition site specifically inhibited binding by E6, but not by two other HLH proteins.
 Expression of E6 (but not an E6 DNA binding mutant) suppressed the ability of c-myc to cooperate with H-ras in a rat embryo fibroblast transformation assay, suggesting that the DNA recognition specificity of E6 is related to that of c-Myc in vivo.

1315,"Tumorigenic 3T3 cells maintain an alkaline intracellular pH under physiological conditions.
 One of the earliest events in the response of mammalian cells to mitogens is activation of Na+/H+ exchange, which increases intracellular pH (pHin) in the absence of HCO3- or at external pH values below 7.2.
 The proliferative response can be blocked by preventing the pHin increase; yet, the proliferative response cannot be stimulated by artificially raising pHin with weak bases or high medium pH.
 These observations support the hypothesis that optimal pHin is a necessary, but not sufficient, component of the proliferative-response sequence.
 This hypothesis has recently been challenged by the observation that transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with yeast H(+)-ATPase renders them tumorigenic.
 Although previous measurements indicated that these transfected cells maintain a higher pHin in the absence of HCO3-, whether H(+)-ATPase transfection raised the pHin under physiologically relevant conditions was not known.
 The current report shows that these transfected cells do maintain a higher pHin than control cells in the presence of HCO3-, supporting the possibility that elevated pHin is a proliferative trigger in situ.
 We also show that these cells are serum-independent for growth and that they glycolyze much more rapidly than phenotypically normal cells.

 Familial growth hormone deficiency type 1A is an autosomal recessive disease caused by deletion of both growth hormone-1 (GH1) alleles.
 Ten patients from heterogeneous geographic origins showed differences in restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotypes in nondeleted regions that flanked GH1, suggesting that these deletions arose from independent unequal recombination events.
 Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from nine of ten patients showed that crossovers occurred within 99% homologous, 594-base pair (bp) segments that flanked GH1.
 A DNA sample from one patient indicated that the crossover occurred within 454-bp segments that flanked GH1 and contained 274-bp repeats that are 98% homologous.
 Although Alu repeats, which are frequent sites of recombination, are adjacent to GH1, they were not involved in any of the recombination events studied.
 These results suggest that length and degree of DNA sequence homology are important in defining recombination sites that resulted in GH1 deletions.

 For urine free cortisol, a mean suppressed value of less than 1000 nmol/24 hours was found in all patients with Cushing's disease, but in none of those in the ectopic group.
 In the metyrapone test, there was an increase of less than or equal to 3-fold in 11-deoxycortisol at 24 hours in patients with ectopic ACTH; the increase was greater than 3-fold in all but one of the patients with Cushing's disease.
 Failure to respond to either dexamethasone or metyrapone was found in only one of the patients with Cushing's disease (Patient 16); in the ectopic group, all patients except Patient D failed to respond to either test.
 It is concluded that patients presenting with clinically obvious Cushing's syndrome along with measurable plasma ACTH can be reliably divided by conventional tests into those that are driven from the pituitary and those driven by ectopic ACTH.

1318,"Comparison of motor response to apomorphine and levodopa in Parkinson's disease.
 The magnitude and pattern of motor responses to single doses of subcutaneous apomorphine and oral levodopa were compared in 14 patients with Parkinson's disease.
 Although apomorphine produced much shorter motor responses than levodopa, the quality of response to the two drugs was virtually indistinguishable.
 These clinical observations support the notion that integrity of striatal post-synaptic dopamine receptors is a key determinant of responsiveness to dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson's disease.

 Oral nifedipine (N) and clonidine (C) are often used in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies; however, until recently, there were no comparative studies using the same patient population.
 The authors reviewed the records of hypertensive patients treated in the emergency department between October 1, 1987 and September 30, 1988.
 Selected patients had a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of greater than 115 mm Hg without evidence of acute end organ damage.
 Patients were stratified into three treatment groups: N, C, and group 3 (G3).
 G3 received a variety of drug therapies but not exclusively N or C.
 Systolic blood pressure (SBP), DBP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), percent decrease in MAP (%MAP), time to lower blood pressure, admissions, and discharges were evaluated.
 Efficacy and safety were defined as reaching a DBP less than 110 mm Hg but %MAP of no greater than either 25% or 40%, respectively.
 Thirty-five N, 32 C, and 27 G3 patients were identified with no statistical difference between groups in race, gender, pretreatment SBP, DBP, or MAP.
 N, C, and G3 significantly reduced SBP, DBP, and MAP (P less than .01).
 Comparing N, C, and G3, no differences were observed in %MAP, admissions, discharges, efficacy, or safety.
 Time required to decrease blood pressure differed between all three groups (44 +/- 32 N v 77 +/- 57 C v 152 +/- 94 min G3) (p less than .05).
 These results indicate that N, C, and a variety of drug therapies are equally effective and safe in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies.

1320,"Deleterious effects of criminal victimization on women's health and medical utilization.
 The long-term consequences of criminal victimization on physical health were examined among 390 adult women (74 nonvictims and 316 victims of crime).
 Data included health status self-ratings and objective service utilization.
 Findings indicated that severely victimized women, compared with nonvictims, reported more distress and less well-being, made physician visits twice as frequently in the index year, and had outpatient costs that were 2.5 times greater.
 Criminal victimization severity was the most powerful predictor of physician visits and outpatient costs.
 Utilization data across 5 years preceding and following crime were obtained from 15 rape victims, 26 physical assault victims, and 27 noncontact crime victims and were compared with five continuous years of utilization among 26 nonvictims.
 Victims' physician visits increased 15% to 24% during the year of the crime compared with less than 2% change among nonvictims.
 We conclude that these long-term deleterious effects suggest that criminally victimized women's needs for medical treatment transcend the traditional focus on emergency care and forensic evaluation.

1321,"Echocardiographic left ventricular mass and electrolyte intake predict arterial hypertension.
 OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of arterial hypertension.
 PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-two normotensive adults from a large employed population.
 METHODS: Echocardiography, standard blood tests, and 24-hour urine collection, at baseline and after an interval of 3 to 6 years (mean, 4.7 +/- 0.8 years).
 RESULTS: At follow-up, 15 subjects (11%; 7 men, 8 women) had a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg or both (mean, 143 +/- 7 and 87 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively).
 At baseline, subjects who developed hypertension had a greater left ventricular mass index than those who did not (92 +/- 25 compared with 77 +/- 19 g/m2 body surface area; P less than 0.005) and higher 24-hour urinary sodium/potassium excretion ratio (3.6 +/- 1.7 compared with 2.6 +/- 1.4; P less than 0.04); there were no differences in race, initial age, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, coronary risk factors, or plasma renin activity.
 The likelihood of developing hypertension rose from 3% in the lowest quartile of sex-adjusted left ventricular mass index to 24% in the highest quartile (P less than 0.005); a parallel trend was less regular for quartiles of the sodium/potassium excretion ratio (P less than 0.04).
 In multivariate analyses, follow-up systolic pressures in all subjects and in the 117 who remained normotensive were predicted by initial age, systolic blood pressure, black race, and sex-adjusted left ventricular mass index; final diastolic blood pressure was predicted by its initial value, plasma triglyceride levels, urinary sodium/potassium ratio, low renin activity, black race, and plasma glucose level.
 CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographic left ventricular mass in normotensive adults is directly related to the risk for developing subsequent hypertension.
 Left ventricular mass improves prediction of future systolic pressure, whereas diastolic pressure is more related to initial metabolic status.
 Black race is also an independent determinant of higher subsequent blood pressure.

 Fifty-three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 25 computed tomography (CT) studies of 53 head and neck masses in pediatric patients were reviewed retrospectively.
 All lesions had pathologic proof except for 2 metastatic and 2 recurrent lesions, which only had prior pathologic confirmation at their primary sites.
 These included 12 malignant tumors, 23 benign tumors, 6 inflammatory masses, and 12 congenital lesions.
 The MRI performance ranged predominantly from good to excellent in detection of the lesion and the extent of involvement and in contrast to the surrounding tissue; when CT comparison was available, MRI proved to be equal to or better than it in detection of these factors and in preoperative diagnosis.
 Our results suggest that MRI should be the method of choice for the initial evaluation of the pediatric head and neck region, especially in those patients requiring multiple examinations.
 However, CT and MRI should be used conjunctively in complicated cases, especially those possibly involving lesions with calcifications or bony involvement.

 One hundred thirty-four consecutive patients (65 men and 69 women) underwent pulmonary resection for bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
 Mean age was 65 years.
 Lobectomy was done in 100 patients, pneumonectomy in 10, segmentectomy in 5, and wedge excision in 19.
 Only 10 patients had lymph node metastases (7.5%).
 The neoplasm was solitary in 111 patients (82.8%); 97 were in stage I, 4 were in stage II, 9 were in stage IIIa, and 1 was in stage IIIb.
 There were two operative deaths (1.5%).
 Thirty-nine complications occurred in 31 patients.
 Median follow-up was 5.1 years.
 Recurrent bronchoalveolar carcinoma developed in 45 patients.
 Five- and 10-year survival for patients in stage I was 75.2% and 62.0%, respectively.
 Survival for patients with T1 N0 M0 neoplasms was identical to expected survival and was 90.5% at 5 years, as compared with 55.4% for patients with T2 N0 M0 disease, only 35.9% for patients with multiple bilateral disease, and 0.0% for patients with bilateral disease (p less than 0.0001).
 Other significant factors adversely affecting survival included the presence of signs and symptoms, diffuse malignant invasion, mucin-producing tumors, and the histological absence of scar.
 We conclude that bronchoalveolar carcinoma has a unique natural history that is more influenced by local neoplastic processes than by lymph node metastases.
 Early aggressive pulmonary resection is safe and offers the potential for cure.
 The presence of bilateral cancer, however, is ominous.

 This study tests the hypothesis that multidose, hypocalcemic aspartate/glutamate-enriched blood cardioplegia provides safe and effective protection during prolonged aortic clamping of immature hearts.
 Of 17 puppies (6 to 8 weeks of age, 3 to 5 kg) placed on vented cardiopulmonary bypass, five were subjected to 60 minutes of 37 degrees C global ischemia without cardioplegic protection and seven underwent 120 minutes of aortic clamping with 4 degrees C multidose aspartate/glutamate-enriched blood cardioplegia ([Ca++] = 0.2 mmol/L), preceded and followed by 37 degrees C blood cardioplegic induction and reperfusion.
 Five puppies underwent blood cardioplegic perfusion for 10 minutes without intervening ischemia to assess the effect of the cardioplegic solution and the delivery techniques.
 Left ventricular performance was assessed 30 minutes after bypass was discontinued (Starling function curves).
 Hearts were studied for high-energy phosphates and tissue amino acids.
 One hour of normothermic ischemia resulted in profound functional depression, with peak stroke work index only 43% of control (0.7 +/- 0.1 versus 1.7 +/- 0.2 gm x m/kg, p less than 0.05).
 There was 70% depletion of adenosine triphosphate (7.6 +/- 1 versus control 20.3 +/- 1 mumol/gm dry weight, p less than 0.05) and 75% glutamate loss (6.6 +/- 1 versus control 26.4 +/- 3 mumol/gm, p less than 0.05).
 In contrast, after 2 hours of aortic clamping with multidose blood cardioplegia preceded and followed by 37 degrees C blood cardioplegia, there was complete recovery of left ventricular function (peak stroke work index 1.6 +/- 0.2 gm x m/kg) and maintenance of adenosine triphosphates, glutamate, and aspartate levels at or above control levels adenosine triphosphate 18 +/- 2 mumol/gm, aspartate 21 +/- 1 versus control 2 mumol/gm, and glutamate 25.4 +/- 2 mumol/gm).
 Puppy hearts receiving blood cardioplegic perfusion without ischemia had complete recovery of control stroke work index.
 We conclude that methods of myocardial protection used in adults, with amino acid-enriched, reduced-calcium blood cardioplegia, can be applied safely to the neonatal heart and allow for complete functional and metabolic recovery after prolonged aortic clamping.

1325,"Development and reversal of contingent inefficacy and tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine.
 The relationship of the timing of drug administration to anticonvulsant efficacy against amygdala kindled seizures was studied.
 During kindling development, rats received carbamazepine (CBZ, 15mg/kg) before (CBZ-before) or after each amygdala stimulation (CBZ-after).
 After kindling to full seizures, when all animals were given CBZ before the stimulation, only the CBZ-after group showed a good anticonvulsant response.
 The rats that had received CBZ before (during development of kindled seizures) remained unresponsive to CBZ treatment (contingent inefficacy).
 When drug-naive or CBZ-after animals repeatedly received CBZ before electrical stimulation, they developed tolerance to its anticonvulsant effects (contingent tolerance).
 The tolerance could be reversed by a period of treatment with CBZ-after or by kindling the animal drug-free, but not by CBZ administration alone or by time off from both drug and seizures.
 These findings suggest that inefficacy and tolerance to CBZ may be affected by the temporal contingencies of drug administration and that responsiveness can be reinstated by altering these contingencies.

 Hypertension was present in 50% of 196 blacks and in 36% of 382 whites (p less than 0.001).
 A prospective study of 84 elderly blacks (70% women) and 326 elderly whites (73% women) with hypertension correlated echocardiographic and electrocardiographic left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with incidences of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary events and atherothrombotic brain infarction (ABI).
 Echocardiographic LV hypertrophy (p less than 0.02) and concentric LV hypertrophy (p less than 0.001) were more prevalent in hypertensive blacks than in hypertensive whites.
 Hypertensive blacks were younger (78 +/- 9 years) than hypertensive whites (82 +/- 7 years) (p less than 0.001).
 Other coronary risk factors were similar, except for higher serum triglycerides in whites than in blacks (p less than 0.02).
 Follow-up was 37 +/- 18 months in blacks and 43 +/- 18 months in whites (p less than 0.01).
 Incidences of CHF and coronary events were not significantly different in blacks and whites.

1328,"Cytokine regulation of IL-1 beta gene expression in the human polymorphonuclear leukocyte.
 Although recently polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) have been identified as producers of IL-1 beta in response to LPS and granulocyte/monocyte colony stimulating factor, little is known regarding the ability of other cytokines to induce the production of IL-1 beta in the PMN.
 Inasmuch as IL-1 and TNF have been shown to be important priming agents, as well as agents that induce migration of PMN, we investigated their effect on IL-1 beta gene expression in human peripheral blood PMN.
 In the present study, we demonstrate that human peripheral blood PMN produce IL-1 beta in response to IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha.
 Control (unstimulated) human PMN had virtually undetectable levels of IL-1 beta mRNA.
 Either IL-1 beta or TNF, induced PMN to transiently express IL-1 beta mRNA with peak expression at 1 h, returning to untreated levels by 2 h.
 A dose response indicated that as little as 0.05 ng/ml of IL-1 beta or TNF resulted in IL-1 beta induction, with maximal effects at 1 ng/ml of IL-1 beta and 5 ng/ml of TNF.
 IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta exhibited similar dose responses in IL-1 beta mRNA induction.
 Inasmuch as cytokines have been shown to have synergistic effects in cell function studies, we induced PMN with a combination of maximally effective doses of TNF plus IL-1 beta.
 They demonstrated a cooperative effect on IL-1 beta gene expression, in that mRNA levels were sustained for three hours.
 IL-1 beta Ag expression, as measured by ELISA, paralleled IL-1 beta mRNA expression with cell associated peak levels at 2 to 4 h.
 IL-1 beta Ag levels in PMN lysates and supernatants correlated with IL-1 beta mRNA levels, i.e., TNF + IL-1 greater than TNF greater than IL-1.
 Thus, these studies represent the first demonstration of IL-1 and TNF induction of IL-1 beta gene expression in the PMN.
 Furthermore, the time course of induction is unique to the PMN, with peak induction of mRNA at 1 h, which is consistent with the short lived nature of these cells in inflammatory lesions.

 Seventy-two percent of patients in the aneuploid but only 35% in the diploid group were alive after a mean follow-up of 30.7 and 28.8 months (p = 0.01), and 5-yr survival of 56.7% and 11.7%, respectively (p less than 0.05).
 The site of tumor location, Dukes' stage, and serum CEA level did not predict a certain DNA stemline.
 However, irrespective of the ploidy pattern, a serum CEA level greater than 5.0 was associated with a higher mortality and poor 5-yr survival (p less than 0.005).
 Similarly, advanced Dukes' stage was associated with higher mortality (p less than 0.05).
 Forty-six percent of the patients with lesions that were Dukes' B2 or advanced stage received adjuvant therapy.

 Major parenchymal features seen at CT included thickened intralobular and interlobular lines, subpleural curvilinear lines, pleural-based nodular irregularities, hazy patches of increased attenuation, small cystic spaces, and small areas of low attenuation.
 At paired serial CT, subpleural isolated dots or branching structures connected with the most peripheral branch of the pulmonary artery started to appear in lower subpleural zones and then became confluent to create pleural-based nodular irregularities.
 CT-pathologic correlation led to the conclusion that the confluence of subpleural peribronchiolar fibrosis creates subpleural fibrosis.

 There was a high variability in performance between incidents and within each group.

 The functions of the endothelium and the effects of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes on the endothelium are reviewed.
 The endothelium affects vascular tone by releasing vasodilators and modulating the effects of vasoactive substances such as catecholamines, bradykinin, serotonin, and angiotensin II.
 Relaxation of vascular smooth muscle depends upon a functionally intact endothelium and the release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide.
 Endothelial cells also appear to release a hyperpolarizing factor that relaxes smooth muscle through activation of the sodium-potassium pump, and of the endothelium-dependent contracting factors.
 Similarities are found in the vascular injury resulting from hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes.
 When these risk factors coexist, they can act synergistically and magnify the vascular injury.
 The endothelium appears to be one of the major targets for these forms of injury.

1337,"The role of cellular maturation in neutrophil heterogeneity.
 Previous studies have shown that many neutrophil (PMN) characteristics are heterogeneous but the origin of PMN heterogeneity is unknown.
 It is unclear if PMN functional heterogeneity is secondary to maturational differences or due to distinct subpopulations of cells that possess different functional capacities.
 The PMN 31D8 antigen is a useful probe for evaluation of PMN subpopulations.
 The majority of PMNs (approximately 85%) exhibit a high intensity fluorescence after 31D8 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) labeling (31D8 enriched or ""bright"" PMNs) as determined by flow cytometric analysis.
 These cells are more functional than cells with low intensity fluorescence (31D8 diminished or ""dull"" PMNs).
 Various immunologic, clonogenic and functional techniques were used to study the expression of the 31D8 antigen in HL-60 cells and myeloid cells in order to evaluate antigenic and functional heterogeneity during morphologic maturation.
 The results of this study indicate that the percentage of 31D8 antigen positive (31D8 antigen enriched and diminished) bone marrow cells increases from 20 +/- 11% in myeloblast cells to 68 +/- 10% in promyelocytes, 93 +/- 2% in myelocytes and 99 +/- 1% in bands and PMNs.
 31D8 antigen enriched cells first appear at the myelocyte stage (32 +/- 10%) and increase in bands (52 +/- 13%), marrow PMNs (62 +/- 13%) and peripheral blood PMNs (88 +/- 4%).
 These data indicate that the heterogeneous expression of 31D8 antigen in PMNs is due, at least in part, to maturational differences within the PMN population and raise the possibility that other heterogeneously expressed PMN characteristics are also maturationally derived.
 They also suggest that 31D8 antigenic expression may be a more precise indicator of myeloid functional maturation than maturation as identified by cellular morphology.

 The effect of an elapsed interval of time between injury and operative repair of the flexor tendons was investigated in a canine model.
 Transected intrasynovial flexor tendons were repaired either immediately or after a delay of seven or twenty-one days.
 The biomechanical, biochemical, and morphological characteristics were compared at three and six weeks.
 The values for angular rotation, linear excursion, ultimate load, and linear slope were determined; concentrations of collagen and reducible collagen cross-links, an index of newly synthesized collagen, were measured; and the ultrastructural morphology of the tendons was examined by high-voltage electron microscopy.
 For the tendons that were repaired immediately, the values for angular rotation were 9.4 +/- 3.2 and 13.0 +/- 3.7 degrees at three and six weeks; for those that were repaired at seven days, 4.1 +/- 1.3 and 2.5 +/- 1.4 degrees; and for those that were repaired at twenty-one days, 2.7 +/- 0.8 and 4.7 +/- 0.7 degrees.
 There was a significant effect of the delay until repair on the angular rotation and linear excursion in all three groups (p less than 0.005 for both).
 Tensile testing of the bone-tendon complex revealed no significant effect of the delay on the values for ultimate load (p greater than 0.05).
 There were no significant differences in total concentration of collagen at the sites of repair or in the levels of reducible Schiff-base cross-links (indicators of newly synthesized cross-links) in tendons from the three groups.

 To investigate the involvement of the trigeminal system in cluster headache, in twelve subjects the electrically-elicited blink reflex during a symptomatic period was examined.
 In eleven cases, the amplitude of the contralateral R2 response on the symptomatic side was significantly lower, at the same stimulus intensity, than on the asymptomatic side (p = 0.005).
 The blink reflex can be useful to evaluate biological and drug-induced phenomena in cluster headache.

 Among 126 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty, 34 were judged to be at high risk for surgery on the basis of age greater than 70 years (n = 13), New York Heart Association functional class IV (n = 11), ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% (n = 3), severe pulmonary hypertension (n = 7), need for associated coronary bypass (n = 4) or additional valve surgery (n = 20) or severe pulmonary disease (n = 3).
 Baseline features of the high risk group were substantially worse than those of the other patients: age (65 +/- 11 versus 49 +/- 12 years; p = 0.0001) and echocardiographic score (9.4 +/- 1.8 versus 8.2 +/- 1.5; p = 0.005) were higher, whereas cardiac output (2.9 +/- 0.9 versus 4.1 +/- 1.2 liters/min; p = 0.0001) and mitral valve area (0.9 +/- 0.4 versus 1.1 +/- 0.3 mm2; p = 0.002) were lower.
 Three high risk patients experienced technical failures and three others had major complications.
 Among the remaining 28 patients, 18 (65%) had a complete hemodynamic success, 4 (14%) an incomplete success and 6 (21%) hemodynamic failure.

1345,"A hepatoblastoma originating in the caudate lobe radically resected with the inferior vena cava.
 Complete resection of a rare hepatoblastoma in the caudate lobe, involving the inferior vena cava (IVC), is reported.
 After systemic chemotherapy, a 5-year-old child underwent exploratory laparotomy at another hospital, but resection was not attempted because the tumor in the caudate lobe had extensively invaded the retrohepatic IVC.
 However, because not only the lack of distant metastases but also the establishment of extrahepatic collaterals were confirmed by imaging, we thought it was possible to radically resect the tumor.
 We successfully performed an extended left hepatic lobectomy including total excision of the caudate lobe and the involved portion of the IVC.
 Although we did not reconstruct the IVC, no clinical manifestations arising from caval congestion were seen.
 The serum alpha-fetoprotein value declined below the normal limit.
 Our experience with this case has introduced a radical resectability for hepatic malignancy in the caudate lobe, even if it has extended into the IVC.

1346,"Drinking in college: consumption patterns, problems, sex differences and legal drinking age.
 Data from 606 (75.8%) undergraduate respondents drawn from a random sample (N = 800) at Rutgers University demonstrate that, although fewer college students may be drinking when compared to some previous estimates, there is still a large number of heavy drinkers.
 In addition, traditional demographic variables continue to predict alcohol consumption levels.
 Students also report a similar variety of drinking related problems as in previous college drinking studies.
 Women constitute half as many heavy drinkers as men, but report an equal amount of alcohol-related problems in this sample.
 When controlling for race, it appears that white students continue to drink the most, and show heavy drinking rates comparable to a previous large college sample in the northeast.
 Students who live on campus drink more than their commuting counterparts, and the drinking age has little effect on consumption levels or total reported alcohol-related problems, although it alters the context of drinking somewhat.
 Findings are generally compared to previous as well as more recent college drinking data.
 Sex differences and similarities are discussed, as well as the findings concerning legal drinking status.

1347,"Evidence of an antiplatelet aggregation action of doxazosin in patients with hypertension: an ex vivo study.
 Eighteen patients with a mean age of 54.7 years were included in the study.
 All patients had a diagnosis of mild or moderate essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure of 96 to 114 mm Hg).
 The study design was single blind and in two phases: phase I, placebo (4 weeks), and phase II, the active treatment (8 weeks) with increasing doses, if needed, of doxazosin every 2 weeks (1, 2, 4, and 8 mg/day).
 Results show that doxazosin has an antihypertensive effect that is dose dependent.
 Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures were decreased significantly, and no effect on heart rate was observed.
 Doxazosin significantly inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by epinephrine, adenosine diphosphate, and collagen in a dose-dependent manner.
 In addition, treatment with doxazosin lowered total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, without changing other standard biochemical parameters.
 This indicates that doxazosin could offer a distinct therapeutic advantage in the modulation of atherogenic and thromboembolic factors associated with coronary heart disease.

 Victims of penetrating trauma often arrive at a trauma center within minutes of sustaining their injury but nevertheless are in a state of deep circulatory shock.
 Such patients require extensive resuscitative efforts; in particular, some benefit from rapid, massive normothermic fluid resuscitation.
 During an initial one year period, 153 of 730 patients required immediate operation and, of these, 33 required rapid infusion defined as greater than 5 liters per hour during the first hour.
 The over-all survival rate of those operated upon was 79 per cent.
 Encouraged by these data, the rapid infusor (Level 1 H-500) (Level 1, Technologies, Inc.) was modified to further increase normothermic fluid delivery to 500 milliliters per minute.
 Eleven of the subsequent 205 patients required rapid infusion.
 There was a statistically significant improvement in clinical flow rates, decrement in resuscitation times and unexpected survival.
 In particular, the latter group (nine survivors) included four who were clinically dead in the field or on arrival at the trauma center, or both.
 Rapid infusion of normothermic fluids may be of benefit not only in penetrating trauma but also more generally in the management of massive hemorrhage.

 for 2 days preoperatively, 5 mg/kg body weight/24 h i.v.
 peroperatively and 100 mg orally q.i.d.

 Withdrawn from the study were 48 patients on dipyridamole and 57 on placebo.
 Cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events or need for anticoagulant treatment were the reasons for withdrawal in 22 (13%) of the dipyridamole, and 34 (18%) of the placebo group.
 Logistic regression analysis of risk factors influencing graft patency showed significant relation to peroperatively measured coronary blood flow.
 A positive trend of treatment was observed (p = 0.08).
 Vein graft blood flow measured during bypass surgery (245 patients) was significantly greater in the dipyridamole group (p less than 0.01).
 The occlusion rate was lower in vessels with peroperative blood flow greater than 30 ml/min (vein-marginal p less than 0.01, vein-dexter p less than 0.05, vein-diagonal 0.05 less than p less than 0.1).

 Histories and computed tomograms of 606 patients with transient cerebral ischaemia were studied.
 All symptoms and signs had completely resolved within 24 hours, and any episodes suggestive of posterior fossa ischaemia were excluded.
 Computed tomography, done after the clinical features had resolved, showed 79 relevant infarcts: 46 were small, deep, lacunar infarcts (58%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 47-69%), and 33 were larger cortical infarcts.
 The histories and the type of infarct in these 79 patients were compared to see whether lacunar infarcts were preceded by a history of unilateral motor or sensory symptoms without features usually attributed to the cerebral cortex.
 The positive predictive value of such lacunar symptoms was 0.74, with a negative predictive value of 0.61.
 11 patients had a cortical infarct despite a history of lacunar TIAs, but only one occurred in the left hemisphere and speech was not affected.
 Of 527 patients with transient ischaemic attacks without a relevant infarct visible on computed tomography, 335 (64%) had a history suggestive of lacunar ischaemia, whereas in several other studies 20-25% of patients with ischaemic stroke have evidence of lacunar infarcts.
 Lacunar TIAs may therefore have a better prognosis than cortical TIAs or may often precede cortical infarcts; alternatively, many cortical infarcts may occur without warning.

1351,"Drinking styles of adolescents and young adults.
 Drinking among adolescents and young adults has received more attention during the recent past, but little research has focused on the drinking styles that might characterize younger people.
 A typology of drinking behavior has special relevance for this group, since the adolescent years and young adult years are formative in the development of drinking habits.
 This study used a model that had been applied to ""normal"" drinking behaviors of adults.
 However, the set of drinking variables was expanded to cover a wider range of activities, and a second set of behaviors, intended to reflect potential ""problem"" drinking, were derived from the National Council on Alcoholism criteria for the diagnosis of alcoholism.
 The set of 55 ""normal"" drinking behaviors was factor analyzed, yielding a six-factor structure.
 The first four factors were quite similar to previous work on adult drinking styles, and the remaining two factors clearly related to the drinking of younger people.
 The ""problem"" drinking variables yielded a two-factor structure, one set consisting of serious but uncommon experiences and the second set consisting of less serious and more common experiences.
 Several of the ""normal"" drinking factors were significant predictors of the ""problem"" drinking scores, suggesting that certain styles of drinking are more likely than others to lead to later problems.

 These results indicate that ""biologic response modification"" may truly become a fourth modality for cancer treatment, to be integrated into the standard approaches of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery.
 To what extent these immune approaches may enable eradication of microscopic amounts of residual diseases in children who would otherwise have a recurrence of their malignancies remains the critical issue for testing over the next decade.
 Enthusiasm regarding this approach is abundant, but critical evaluation of all clinical trials is essential to best focus these mechanisms into effective therapy.

1355,"The value of immunohistochemistry for collagen IV expression in colorectal carcinomas.
 The Dukes' classification has well-established prognostic value in colorectal cancer patients.
 Yet, in each Dukes' class, the survival of individual patients may vary considerably.
 Recent studies show prognostic significance of genetic alterations in colorectal carcinoma.
 However, the importance of tumor stromal components noted in the surrounding tissue may have been overlooked by the methods used.
 Therefore, in a longitudinal study of 154 patients with colorectal cancer operated on between 1967 and 1974, the authors determined the influence on prognosis of lymphocytic infiltration and expression of collagen type IV in tumor stroma.
 Also, age, sex, Dukes' classification, grade of tumor differentiation, vasoinvasion, and the number of positive lymph nodes were analyzed.
 Follow-up was at least 15 years.
 Lymphocytic infiltration and collagen IV expression were scored as mild, moderate, or severe.
 Survival was analyzed by a Cox proportional-hazards model.
 The density of lymphocytic invasion showed no significant influence on survival.
 Collagen IV expression analyzed as a single variable was significantly (P = 0.038) related to better prognosis in colorectal cancer patients.
 By multi-variate analysis collagen IV expression showed a trend toward better prognosis that was not statistically significant (P = 0.12).
 Dukes' classification (P less than 0.001), the presence of vasoinvasion (P = 0.009), and lymph node status (P = 0.04) significantly influenced survival.
 In conclusion immunohistochemistry for collagen IV is an important additional staining technique with prognostic value.
 In addition, collagen IV immunostaining facilitates recognition of vascular invasion by highlighting the basement membrane of vessels.

1356,"Effects of doxazosin on serum lipids: a review of the clinical data and molecular basis for altered lipid metabolism.
 The goal of antihypertensive treatment must be not only the reduction of high blood pressure, but also the effective management of elevated cholesterol levels and other risk factors of coronary heart disease (CHD).
 In controlled clinical trials, doxazosin has been shown to have antihypertensive efficacy comparable with other classes of antihypertensive agents and to lower the levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides while increasing the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
 Doxazosin appears to inhibit the development of CHD on two fronts.
 First, doxazosin binds to the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor and inhibits the receptor-mediated responses to epinephrine and norepinephrine.
 Second, doxazosin has direct and indirect effects on lipid metabolism by increasing LDL receptor activity, decreasing intracellular LDL synthesis, reducing the synthesis and secretion of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and stimulating lipoprotein lipase activity.
 Doxazosin may also inhibit platelet aggregation.
 Long-term studies will determine how these actions translate into reductions in the morbidity and mortality rates of CHD.
 First-year results from the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) have demonstrated expected reductions in blood pressure for all antihypertensive agents studied.
 The lipid changes have varied with the type of antihypertensive treatment and have been favorable for doxazosin.

 To examine the relations among hypertrophy, fibrosis and diastolic performance in early experimental hypertension, 18 control dogs and 12 dogs with experimental left ventricular hypertrophy were studied.
 Diastolic function was impaired in dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy, with decreased Doppler early to atrial inflow velocity ratio (E/A) (1.35 versus 1.72), increased atrial filling fraction (35% versus 29%), decreased sonomicrometric peak rates of wall thinning (-2.01 versus -3.37 liters/s) and filling (4.33 versus 6.64 liters/s) and prolonged time constant of isovolumetric relaxation (tau; 34.3 versus 28.1 ms).
 Neither chamber stiffness (k; P = AekV) nor passive elastic stiffness (E; E = k sigma, where sigma = stress) was increased.
 At postmortem examination, the hypertensive left ventricle weighed significantly more than normal (116 versus 80 g; p less than 0.01) and had greater muscle fiber diameter at endocardial and epicardial sampling sites in the apical free wall, basal free wall and septum (mean diameter 50 +/- 8 microns in hypertensive dogs, 37 +/- 8 microns in normal dogs; p less than 0.01).
 In contrast, neither percent fibrosis (1.2 +/- 0.8 versus 0.9 +/- 0.6 in normal dogs) nor fibrotic volume (1.21 +/- 0.63 versus 0.72 +/- 0.42%/g in normal dogs) was significantly increased.
 Peak volumetric filling rate was inversely related to fiber diameter (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001), although no variable of left ventricular function was significantly related to percent or volume fibrosis (all r less than 0.60, all p greater than 0.05).
 Thus, diastolic dysfunction may exist in the setting of hypertrophy without significant fibrosis.
 Increased myocyte size was associated with early diastolic filling abnormalities characteristic of the hypertensive left ventricle.
 Fibrosis appears to be a less important determinant of diastolic performance.

 In an attempt to maintain stable levels of an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist throughout the perioperative period, two different oral-transdermal clonidine dosage regimens were administered according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
 We determined the clinical efficacy of a high- and a low-dose clonidine regimen on sedation, hemodynamic parameters, anesthesia, and analgesia.
 The low-dose clonidine group of patients (n = 14) received a 7-cm2 clonidine transdermal patch (Catapres-TTS #2), which was supplemented with oral doses of clonidine approximately 3 micrograms.kg-1 on the evening prior to surgery and on the morning of surgery.

 We performed a case-control study to estimate the relative risk of reoperation for bleeding in coronary artery bypass graft patients who had taken aspirin within the 7 days preceding surgery.
 Comparison of 90 cases of reoperation with 180 matched control subjects gave an estimated odds ratio for reoperation of 1.82 (95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 3.32).
 Although their preoperative coagulation values were similar, cases used significantly more whole blood (cases, 9.5 +/- 5.2 units; control subjects, 3.0 +/- 2.0 units; median +/- interquartile range), packed red blood cells (cases, 2.1 +/- 4.0 units; control subjects, 0.9 +/- 2.0 units), and platelets (cases, 12.2 +/- 12.0 units; control subjects, 2.9 +/- 4.0 units) than control subjects.

 We conclude that aspirin exposure within 7 days before coronary bypass surgery is associated with an increased rate of reoperation for bleeding and that reoperation is associated with large increases in transfusion requirements and intensive care unit and hospital stays.

 Catalytic phospholipase A2 activity (CA-PLA2) and the concentration of immunoreactive pancreatic PLA2 (IR-PLA2) were measured in serum samples from 12 patients with multiple injuries (median Injury Severity Score: 41).
 CA-PLA2 was increased in all patients and positive correlations were found between the extent of the increase of CA-PLA2, mortality, and impairment of pulmonary function.
 IR-PLA2 values were slightly increased in the serum of nine patients with multiple injuries.

 The copolymer staples (a blend of polylactic and polyglycolic acids) maintain their tensile strength until healing occurs and absorb without producing granulation tissue.
 The benefits include minimal trauma to tissue and reduced operating time, blood loss and postoperative morbidity.
 From July 1988 to February 1989, all patients undergoing low transverse cervical cesarean sections were randomized to either group 1 with the uterine incision performed in a routine manner or group 2 with the uterine incision cut and stapled using the Stapler.
 The preoperative management, intraoperative technique and postoperative surveillance were similar for both groups.

 These patients also had a statistically significantly decreased incidence of uterine incisions and lacerations.
 All other parameters were not significantly different in the two groups.
 The stapled uterine incisions were visible by ultrasonography in more patients in the stapled group throughout the postpartum period than in the sutured group.

 Postabsorptive serum insulin levels (mean +/- SE, in uU/ml) in D (12 +/- 2), IGT (17 +/- 7), and ND (10 +/- 2) were comparable.
 After administration of 100 g of oral glucose, peak insulin achieved in D (60 +/- 11) was lower than in IGT (101 +/- 26) and ND (83 +/- 20), whereas peak insulin levels in IGT and ND were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than in C (45 +/- 6).
 Comparable insulin response to nonglucose stimuli was documented in all subjects using the slow arginine infusion test with mean serum insulin of 27 +/- 4 in D, 28 +/- 6 in IGT, 34 +/- 10 in ND, and 32 +/- 5 in C.
 In six patients (P) and six controls, insulin action was assessed by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique, with glucose turnover rates estimated by [3-3H]glucose infusion.
 Steady-state plasma glucose concentrations were maintained at 92 +/- 3 (P) and 91 +/- 1 mg/dl (C).
 After insulin infusion at the rate of 1.0 mU/kg/min, comparable high physiologic insulin levels were observed in P (73 to 104 uU/ml) and in C (81 to 103 uU/ml).
 Postabsorptive rates of endogenous glucose appearance (Ra) were higher in P (2.86 to 3.02 mg/kg/min) than in C (1.50 to 2.80 mg/kg/min).
 At high physiologic insulin concentrations, negative Ra values were documented in all subjects, and complete suppression of Ra was assumed.
 Total body glucose use (M) was consistently lower in P (3.90 to 6.40 mg/kg/min) than in C (6.98 to 10.40 mg/kg/min), consistent with a state of insulin resistance.
 Patients with pancreatic cancer manifest insulin resistance by virtue of a decrease in total body glucose use (M) and decreased insulin response to glucose due to either inherent beta cell dysfunction or decreased islet cell mass.
 The latter is not identifiable by histologic morphology.

1368,"MHC-restricted recognition of autologous melanoma by tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells. Evidence for restriction by a dominant HLA-A allele.
 Autologous melanoma-specific CTL recognize a common tumor-associated Ag (TAA) in the context of HLA class I antigens.
 We have demonstrated that HLA-A2 can be a restricting Ag and, in T cell lines homozygous for HLA-A2, that CTL can be generated by stimulation with HLA-A2 allogeneic melanomas.
 In the current study, we have investigated T cell lines from patients who are heterozygous at HLA-A region locus, to determine the relative importance of each A-region allele in this MHC-restricted recognition of tumor.
 We have shown that HLA-A1 can be a restricting Ag, and that allogeneic melanomas expressing HLA-A1 can substitute for the autologous tumor in the generation of HLA-A1-restricted CTL.
 However, when T cell lines express both HLA-A1 and HLA-A2, the HLA-A2 allele governed restriction of the melanoma TAA.
 Three autologous-stimulated HLA-A1, A2 CTL lines all demonstrated restriction by the HLA-A2 allele, when examined in cytotoxicity assays, cold-competition assays, and proliferation assays.
 There was no evidence of restriction by the second HLA-allele, HLA-A1.
 Although the autologous-stimulated CTL use a single A-region allele for tumor recognition, the autologous HLA-A1, A2 tumors are lysed by both HLA-A1-restricted and HLA-A2-restricted CTL.
 The dominance of restricting alleles was further demonstrated when HLA-matched allogeneic melanomas were used as the stimulating tumor to generate tumor-specific CTL.
 Stimulation of the heterozygous (HLA-A1, A2) lymphocytes with HLA-A2-matched allogeneic melanomas resulted in CTL specific for the autologous tumor, and restricted by the HLA-A2 Ag.
 However, stimulation with an HLA-A1-matched allogeneic melanoma failed to induce tumor-specific CTL restricted by the HLA-A1 Ag.
 The data suggest there is a dominance of HLA-A region Ag at the level of the T cell, such that only one is restricting in the recognition of the autologous melanoma.
 At the level of the tumor, however, the TAA is expressed in the context of both HLA-A region alleles.
 We can generate specific CTL from lymph node cells or PBL and HLA-A region matched allogeneic melanomas; however, because most patients are heterozygous at the HLA-A region locus, an understanding of the dominant restricting alleles must be obtained so that an appropriately matched allogeneic melanoma can be selected.

1369,"Acute hospital costs of trauma in the United States: implications for regionalized systems of care.
 As part of a larger effort to determine total direct and indirect costs of injury in the United States, national estimates of the numbers and expenditures associated with acute hospitalization due to traumatic injury were derived using data from the 1984, 1985, and 1986 National Hospital Discharge Surveys (NHDS).
 Estimates of the numbers of hospital episodes and total expenditures are reported in this paper for subgroups of patients defined by age, sex, and body region and AIS severity of the injuries sustained.
 In 1985 2.1 million individuals sustained a traumatic injury which resulted in hospitalization.
 Hospital expenditures totaled $11.4 billion inclusive of professional fees.
 Adolescents and young adults aged 15-44 years accounted for nearly one half of all discharges and total hospital costs.
 The elderly, who represent only 12% of the population, accounted for an additional one quarter of total discharges and hospital costs.
 Nearly three quarters of the hospitalizations and one half of total expenditures were for minor (ICD/AIS = 1, 2) injuries.
 Moderate (ICD/AIS = 3) and severe (ICD/AIS = 4, 5), injuries respectively accounted for 23% and 3% of total episodes and 37% and 11% of total expenditures.
 Only 12% of patients and 25% of trauma care dollars involved injuries sufficiently severe to require treatment at a trauma center.

 Neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP-2), an NH2-terminally processed form of the platelet-release product beta thromboglobulin (beta TG), was purified to homogeneity from stimulated human blood leukocytes.
 In the presence of a vasodilator substance (PGE2, CGRP) picomolar (pmol/l) amounts of NAP-2 induced neutrophil accumulation and plasma leakage on intradermal injection in rabbit skin, whereas the longer forms, beta TG itself and connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III), had no such effect.
 NAP-2-induced increased in microvascular permeability was neutrophil dependent and fast in onset, with a half-life of 65 to 75 minutes, comparable to that previously reported for the structural-related neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin-8 (NAP-1/IL-8).
 However NAP-2 showed a lower potency in that more protein was needed to provoke skin reactivity.
 Nevertheless the finding that a platelet release product can elicit neutrophil-mediated inflammation further narrows the gap between thrombotic events and inflammatory disorders.

 To determine the effect of pregnancy on prognosis in melanoma we investigated 388 women treated for stage 1 primary cutaneous disease during their childbearing years.
 85 women had been treated before any pregnancy, 92 during pregnancy, 143 after they had completed all pregnancies, and 68 between pregnancies.
 Women who had received treatment while pregnant had primary tumours of significantly greater thickness than did those in the other three groups (p = 0.002).
 Other possible confounding factors (site, age, parity) did not differ between the groups.
 Once tumour thickness was controlled for, survival rate of women in whom melanoma was diagnosed and treated while they were pregnant did not differ from that in the other three groups.
 Cox regression analysis showed no differences between the three groups of women who were not pregnant at diagnosis.
 Women with melanoma should be advised about pregnancy on the basis of thickness and site of tumour and evidence of vascular spread, and not hormonal status.

 Relationships among two-month and final goal attainment scaling (GAS) scores, preadmission and final Portland Adaptability Inventory (PAI) scores, and work outcome for 16 graduates of a comprehensive, postacute brain injury rehabilitation program were examined.
 Final GAS scores were higher for program graduates who obtained the most desirable work outcomes, and preadmission and final PAI scores were lower for the successful program graduates.
 Final GAS scores were significantly correlated with other outcome measures.
 Preadmission PAI scores predicted work outcome, and two-month GAS scores predicted final GAS scores.
 Initial PAI scores distinguished between program successes and failures, but not between program successes and dropouts.
 A brief look at one case illustrates the modified application of GAS in postacute brain injury rehabilitation.
 Results of this study and case analyses support GAS as a quantifiable, individualized measure that is useful for (1) monitoring patient progress, (2) structuring team conferences, (3) ongoing rehabilitation planning and decision-making, (4) concise, relevant communication to family, referral sources, and funding sources, and (5) overall program evaluation when used in the context of other objective outcome measures.
 Although our results support the clinical utility of GAS, further study is recommended to assess the psychometric characteristics of GAS in this application.

 Percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty was used to prospectively treat 492 elderly, symptomatic, nonsurgical patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis in 27 centers in North America and Europe.
 At 1 year the overall survival rate was 64% and the event-free survival rate (survival free of valve replacement or repeat valvuloplasty) was 43%.
 Clinical, catheterization and procedural variables were assessed to define prognostic variables.
 Univariate analysis revealed that patients who survived had a lesser frequency of previous myocardial infarction (2% versus 6%, p less than 0.005), lower incidence of severe ventricular dysfunction (22% versus 48%, p less than 0.001) and lower incidence of symptoms of heart failure (60% versus 75%, p less than 0.02).
 History of angina (56% versus 45%, p = NS) and syncope (23% versus 16%, p = NS) were similar for both groups.
 Values obtained at cardiac catheterization that differed in survivors and nonsurvivors included lower pulmonary artery systolic pressure (43 +/- 1 versus 54 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), lower mean pulmonary artery pressure (28 +/- 1.0 versus 36 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and larger initial valve area (0.52 +/- 0.01 versus 0.47 +/- 0.02 cm2, p = 0.006).
 Discriminate function analysis was performed to identify variables that independently predicted improved probability of survival.
 Eight variables were significantly and independently predictive.
 These included age, initial cardiac output, initial left ventricular systolic pressures, initial left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, presence of coronary artery disease, New York Heart Association dyspnea classification, number of balloon inflations and final valve area.

1374,"The role of protein kinase C and calcium in the regulation of norepinephrine release from the vascular adrenergic neurons in hypertension.
 This study was designed to investigate the role of protein kinase C and calcium in vascular adrenergic transmission in hypertension.
 In perfused mesenteric vasculatures of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 7 to 10 weeks old) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), we have examined the effects of the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 on endogenous norepinephrine release and vascular responsiveness during nerve stimulation.
 Endogenous norepinephrine release and pressor responses during periarterial nerve stimulation were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY.
 The protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 inhibited the stimulation-induced norepinephrine release and pressor responses in a dose-dependent manner.
 The magnitude of these suppressive responses were more pronounced in SHR than in WKY.
 Calcium removal from extracellular fluid also reduced the norepinephrine release more strongly in SHR than in WKY.
 These results demonstrate that the regulation of norepinephrine release might be more dependent on protein kinase C and calcium in the blood vessels of SHR, which could contribute, at least partially, to the pathogenesis of this form of hypertension.

 The authors investigated myocardial epinephrine sensitization by subanesthetic concentrations of halothane.
 The dose-response relationship for the action of halothane was examined with etomidate plus varying subanesthetic concentrations of halothane in dogs.
 The arrhythmogenic threshold of epinephrine was decreased in a dose-dependent manner at end-tidal concentrations of halothane between 0.1 and 0.3%.
 At end-tidal halothane is greater than 0.3%, and no further reduction of arrhythmogenic threshold of epinephrine occurred.
 The plasma concentrations of epinephrine producing four or more premature ventricular contractions in 15 s were 201.3 +/- 34.3, 98.1 +/- 13.9, 60.3 +/- 8.63, 57.9 +/- 12.8, 54.5 +/- 8.61, and 53.9 +/- 4.86 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM), at 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% of halothane at end-tidal concentrations, respectively.
 The results suggest that in the presence of etomidate, halothane produces myocardial sensitization to epinephrine at subanesthetic concentrations as low as 0.1%.
 Increasing halothane to 0.3% produces a further reduction in the arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine.

 Of 19,994 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures performed in The Netherlands between April 1980 and January 1989, the long-term follow-up of 454 patients who underwent angioplasty of greater than or equal to 1 saphenous vein bypass graft was reviewed.
 In 46% of patients single graft angioplasty was attempted, and in 54% of patients sequential graft angioplasty was attempted.
 The clinical primary success rate was 90%.
 In-hospital mortality was 0.7%, 2.8% of patients sustained a procedural myocardial infarction, and 1.3% of patients underwent emergency bypass surgery.
 After a follow-up period of 5 years, 74% of patients were alive, and 26% were alive and event-free (no myocardial infarction, no repeat bypass surgery or repeat angioplasty).
 In patients in whom the initial angioplasty attempt was unsuccessful, only 3% were event-free at 5 years, versus 27% of successfully dilated patients.
 The time interval between the angioplasty attempt and previous surgery was a significant predictor for 5-year event-free survival.
 The event-free survival rates for patients who had bypass surgery 1 year before, between 1 and 5 years, and 5 years before angioplasty, were 45, 25 and 19%, respectively.
 Less than one-third of patients with previous bypass surgery who had angioplasty of the graft remained event-free after 5 years.

 For two cases of a high basilar tip aneurysm accompanied by a short intracranial internal carotid artery, the orbitozygomatic temporopolar approach consisting of an en bloc fronto-orbitozygomatic temporal craniotomy and temporopolar approach was carried out.
 On angiograms, the height of the bifurcation of an elongated basilar artery and the length of the intracranial internal carotid artery from the interclinoid line between the anterior and posterior clinoid process were 20 mm and 6 mm in Case 1, and 18 mm and 5 mm in Case 2, respectively.
 The skin flap was separated subfascially to preserve the frontotemporal branch of the facial nerve.
 The fronto-orbitozygomatic temporal bone flap was made, and a part of the basal bony structures of the orbital roof, the sphenoid ridge, and the temporal bone were removed.
 The basilar tip aneurysm could be seen and clipped easily by upward and oblique viewing from below through the wide operative space consisting of the less retracted internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries, the oculomotor nerve, the tentorial hiatus, and the emptied anterior temporal fossa obtained by partial division of the temporal bridging veins.

 Recent work has shown that mild to moderate levels of hypothermia may profoundly reduce the histological and biochemical sequelae of cerebral ischemic injury.
 In the present study, the authors examined the effect of fluid-percussion injury on brain temperature in anesthetized rats and the effect of anesthesia on brain temperature in uninjured rats.
 The relationship between the brain, rectal, and temporalis muscle temperatures during normothermia, hypothermia, and hyperthermia was studied following a moderate magnitude of fluid-percussion brain injury (2.10 to 2.25 atmospheres) in rats.
 The results showed that mean brain temperature in 10 anesthetized injured rats, in 21 anesthetized uninjured rats, and in 10 unanesthetized uninjured rats was a mean (+/- standard error of the mean) of 36.04 degrees +/- 0.20 degrees C, 36.30 degrees +/- 0.08 degrees C, and 37.95 degrees +/- 0.09 degrees C, respectively.
 There was no significant difference in temperature under general anesthesia between injured and uninjured rats (p greater than 0.05).
 In the absence of brain injury, mean brain temperature was significantly lower in anesthetized rats than in unanesthetized rats (p less than 0.001).
 In anesthetized brain-injured rats, temporalis muscle temperature correlated well with brain temperature over a 30 degrees to 40 degrees C range, even when brain temperature was rapidly changed during induction of hypothermia or hyperthermia (r = 0.9986, p less than 0.0001).
 In contrast, rectal temperature varied inconsistently from brain temperature.
 These observations indicated that: 1) brain injury itself does not influence brain temperature in this model; 2) anesthesia alone decreases brain temperature to levels producing cerebral protection in this model; and 3) external monitoring of temporalis muscle temperature can provide a reliable indirect measure of brain temperature in the course of experimental brain injury.
 The authors believe that it is essential to monitor or control brain temperature in studies of experimental brain injury.

 We measured resting ventilation (VE, l.min-1), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2%), the ventilatory response to oxygen breathing, isocapnic hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), and hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) at sea level prior to the ascent (760 torr), 14,000 feet (428 torr), 24,000 feet (305 torr), and within 24 h of descent (765 torr).
 VE increased from 9.3 +/- 1.1 l.min-1 at 760 torr to 23.4 +/- 1.3 l.min-1 at 305 torr and remained elevated at 14.7 +/- 0.7 l.min-1 after descent.

 HVR was elevated further upon return to sea level (0.8 +/- 0.09, P less than 0.05).

 This study is the first to investigate the ventilatory response to such extreme altitude and so soon after descent and shows that hypoxic and hypercapnic responses increase during prolonged progressive hypoxic exposure and remain significantly elevated from pre-ascent levels immediately upon descent.

 We performed a longitudinal study of chronic schizophrenic patients who were hospitalized for research purposes at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Intramural Program in the 1970s and early 1980s.
 We assessed present course, outcome and predictor data from the initial cohort of 58 young chronic schizophrenic patients who were followed up for 2 to 12 years following their NIMH index hospitalization.
 At follow-up, the sample showed substantial functional impairment and levels of symptoms with only about 20% of the sample demonstrating a good outcome.
 In addition, strong intercorrelation was noted among the symptom and functioning indexes at follow-up.
 Moreover, neuropsychologic tests of frontal cortical functioning were significantly correlated with outcome levels of negative symptoms and social functioning but not with levels of positive symptoms.
 During the period from the index hospitalization to the follow-up assessment, 78% of the sample suffered a relapse, 38% attempted suicide and 24% had episodes of major affective illness.
 Furthermore, levels of positive and negative symptoms ascertained when patients received optimal neuroleptic treatment during the index hospitalization significantly predicted outcome levels of symptoms and functioning and time spent hospitalized during the follow-up period.
 In contrast, levels of index positive and negative symptoms ascertained during the drug-free state did not predict outcome symptoms or functioning.
 These data suggest that treatment response is a critical predictor variable.
 We examined the implication of these data for the course of illness in schizophrenics.

 To determine if imaging of blood flow (using N-13 ammonia) and glucose metabolism (using F-18 2-deoxyglucose) with positron emission tomography can distinguish cardiomyopathy of coronary artery disease from nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, 21 patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction who were evaluated for cardiac transplantation were studied.
 The origin of left ventricular dysfunction had been previously determined by coronary angiography to be ischemic (11 patients) or nonischemic (10 patients).
 Images were visually analyzed by three observers on a graded scale in seven left ventricular segments and revealed fewer defects in dilated cardiomyopathy compared with ischemic cardiomyopathy for N-13 ammonia (2.7 +/- 1.6 versus 5 +/- 0.6; p less than 0.03) and F-18 deoxyglucose (2.8 +/- 2.1 versus 4.6 +/- 1.1; p less than 0.03).
 An index incorporating extent and severity of defects revealed more homogeneity with fewer and less severe defects in subjects with nonischemic than in those with ischemic cardiomyopathy as assessed by imaging of flow (2.8 +/- 1.8 versus 9.2 +/- 3; p less than 0.001) and metabolism (3.8 +/- 3.3 versus 8.5 +/- 3.6; p less than 0.005).
 Diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing the two subgroups by visual image analysis was 85%.
 Using previously published circumferential count profile criteria, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy had fewer ischemic segments (0.4 +/- 0.8 versus 2.5 +/- 2 per patient; p less than 0.01) and infarcted segments (0.1 +/- 0.3 versus 2.4 +/- 1.4 per patient; p less than 0.001) than did patients with cardiomyopathy of coronary artery disease.
 The sensitivity for differentiating the two clinical subgroups using circumferential profile analysis was 100% and the specificity 80%.
 An index incorporating both number and severity of defects derived from circumferential profile analysis was significantly lower in subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy than in ischemic cardiomyopathy (0.3 +/- 0.8 versus 2.7 +/- 2.4; p less than 0.005).
 Thus, noninvasive positron emission tomographic imaging with N-13 ammonia and F-18 deoxyglucose is helpful in distinguishing patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction secondary to coronary artery disease from those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and a semiquantitative index such as circumferential profile analysis is superior to that of visual analysis alone.

 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: An experimental canine model of hemorrhagic, hypovolemic shock is described that uses oxygen debt and its metabolic consequences of lactic acidemia and metabolic base deficit as independent variables for the prediction of probability of death.
 RESULTS: Lactic acidemia and metabolic base deficit are compared with the conventional hemodynamic variables of BP and cardiac output (Qt) as predictors of outcome and are shown to be superior using a modified Kaplan-Meier probability statistic.
 The LD50 for oxygen debt is shown to be 113.5 mL/kg, 12.9 mmol/L for lactate, and -18.8 mmol/L for base excess (BE).
 Comparison is made between the ability of Qt, BP, shed blood, BE, and lactate to predict oxygen debt.
 CONCLUSIONS: Of the single-variable predictors, BE shows the highest explained variability.
 However, a combined prediction from both lactate and BE appears superior to the use of either alone.
 Using this regression to compute the oxygen debt, it is possible to estimate accurately the actual level of oxygen debt from the BE and lactate values obtained during hemorrhagic hypovolemia.
 From serial determinations over time of the increase in these biochemical variables above the oxygen debt baseline, it is possible to estimate the rate of oxygen debt accumulation and the time remaining until the LD50 will be reached as indicators of the severity of the total body ischemia resulting from hemorrhagic shock.

 We compared whole blood platelet aggregation, adenosine triphosphate release, platelet count, platelet crit (percentage volume of platelets), and mean platelet volume during the acute, subacute, and chronic periods of cerebral thrombosis in 22 patients with value in 29 controls.
 During the acute and subacute periods, platelet aggregation, platelet count, platelet crit, and mean platelet volume were significantly less in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.05-0.01) while the adenosine triphosphate release rate per volume of platelets was significantly greater (p less than 0.05).
 During the acute period, infarct size showed a significant positive correlation with platelet aggregation (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01) and adenosine triphosphate release rate (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001) but a negative correlation with platelet count (r = -0.44, p less than 0.05).
 Our results suggest that platelet aggregation is reduced during the acute period due to the consumption of platelets during thrombogenesis but that the remaining individual platelets are hyperactive.
 Platelet consumption during the acute period increases with infarct size.
 During the chronic period, platelet crit and mean platelet volume were significantly less in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.01) while the adenosine triphosphate release rate was significantly greater (p less than 0.01), suggesting sustained platelet consumption and chronically enhanced secretion of individual platelets.

1396,"Clinical evaluation of interferons in malignant melanoma.
 The evaluation of interferons in the treatment of malignant melanoma has been mainly in the treatment of advanced disease using interferons as the sole agent or in combination with other agents.
 Studies of the value of interferons as adjuvant therapy in high-risk primary melanoma patients are necessary, but no results have been published to date.
 Human interferon alpha produces low response rates as a sole agent, but in combination with cimetidine, a 30% response rate has been achieved.
 Recombinant alpha interferons give responses of 15%-20% in advanced melanomas, and combination with cimetidine does not enhance the response rate.
 Recombinant alpha interferons have been used in combination with other interferons, cimetidine, monoclonal antibodies, and cytotoxics, with either no or small improvement in response rates.
 DTIC with recombinant interferon alpha-2a has been shown to produce objective response rates of 26%, with low toxicity and maintenance of quality of life.
 A randomized trial with DTIC as the sole agent, compared with combination treatment, is being conducted to determine the significance of this finding.

1397,"Furosemide-131I-hippuran renography after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension.
 PURPOSE: We have previously demonstrated the greater sensitivity of 131I-hippuran renography than 99mTC-DTPA scintigraphy to diagnose renovascular hypertension (RVH).
 This study assesses the predictive diagnostic value of furosemide-131I-hippuran renography after angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in patients with and without RVH.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients were investigated at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center.
 Twenty-eight patients had RVH and 22 did not.
 Twenty-eight patients had normal or minimally decreased renal function (serum creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL or less) and 22 had renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level 1.8 mg/dL or more).
 Renography was performed 60 minutes after oral administration of 50 mg captopril or 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 40 micrograms/kg enalaprilat.
 Forty milligrams of furosemide were administered intravenously 2 minutes after injection of 131I-hippuran.
 The residual cortical activity (RCA) of 131I-hippuran was measured at 20 minutes.
 RESULTS: RVH was unlikely when RCA after ACE inhibition was less than 30% of peak cortical activity.
 Conversely, RVH was present when 131I-hippuran cortical activity steadily increased throughout the test to reach 100% at 20 minutes.
 In azotemic patients with RCA between 31% and 100%, RVH was differentiated from intrinsic renal disease by obtaining a baseline renogram without ACE inhibition and comparing RCA in that study and RCA after ACE inhibition.
 If RCA increased (indicating worsening renal function) after ACE inhibition, RVH was likely; whereas, intrinsic renal disease was more likely if RCA remained unchanged or decreased (indicating improved renal function) with ACE inhibition.
 The test had a specificity of 95% and a sensitivity of 96% in this population.
 There was a direct correlation between the results of angioplasty or surgery on high blood pressure and the changes in RCA before and after intervention (n = 20).
 CONCLUSION: Furosemide-131I-hippuran renography with ACE inhibition is highly predictive in identifying patients with RVH.

1398,"Meniscus repair in the anterior cruciate deficient knee.
 From 1979 to 1986, isolated repair of a peripheral vascular zone meniscal tear was performed in 22 patients (23 menisci) who had ACL insufficiency.
 For various reasons none of these patients underwent repair or reconstruction of their ACL.
 The meniscus repair was done by open arthrotomy in 12 cases and by arthroscopic techniques in 11 cases.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success rate of a meniscal repair in an anterior cruciate deficient knee.
 The average age of the patients at the time of surgery was 25 years and the average followup was 56 months.
 Six patients (26%) had mild occasional pain not requiring medication and one patient had moderate pain requiring nonnarcotic pain medication.
 Eight patients (26%) had occasional giving way episodes and one of them underwent ACL reconstruction 5 years later because of frequent giving way.
 One patient required a postoperative manipulation for inadequate range of motion, but there were no neurovascular injuries or infections.
 There were three patients (13%) who had failed repairs or a retear and required subsequent subtotal meniscectomies.
 None of the other patients had any clinical symptoms or signs of a meniscal tear.
 There were no significant differences between the results of open or arthroscopic repair.
 Even though the failure rate of meniscus repair may be greater in an unstable knee, we conclude that meniscus repair is not contraindicated in an anterior cruciate deficient knee.

1400,"Two types of abnormal genes for plasminogen in families with a predisposition for thrombosis [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Apr 1;88(7):2967]
 The gene coding for plasminogen has been compared with several abnormal genes from Japanese patients by the polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence analysis.
 Two types of abnormal genes coding for plasminogen were identified in these patients.
 In the type I mutation, a guanosine in GCT coding for Ala-601 near the active-site histidine was replaced by an adenosine resulting in ACT coding for threonine.
 This mutation was also shown by the loss of a cleavage site for Fnu4HI endonuclease, a restriction enzyme that recognizes GCTGC but not ACTGC.
 In the type II mutation, a guanosine in GTC coding for Val-355 was replaced by a thymidine resulting in TTC coding for phenylalanine.
 This change was readily shown by digestion with Ava II endonuclease, a restriction enzyme that recognizes GGTCC and not GTTCC.
 The type I mutation has been found to be identical to a plasminogen variant identified in Japanese patients by amino acid sequence analysis and also detected by isoelectric focusing, whereas the type II mutation is a unique amino acid substitution in the connecting region between the third and fourth kringles in plasminogen.
 DNA sequence analysis also revealed that the abnormal genes carry several silent nucleotide substitutions located primarily within introns and 5' and 3' flanking regions.

1401,"Aspirin reduces the growth of medial and neointimal thickenings in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries.
 We analyzed the effect of Aspirin on the growth of experimentally induced vascular thickenings in rat carotid arteries.
 Vascular thickenings were induced by denudation of the endothelium in the left carotid artery with a balloon catheter.
 Administration of Aspirin-rich food (17.4 g/kg body wt/day) was started 1 week before and continued 2 weeks after injury.
 Nine rats were used.
 A control group of equal size received normal food.
 Sizes of the tunica media, the neointima, and the open vessel lumen were measured on cross sections of carotid segments with the aid of a videomorphometry system.
 The results show that in the Aspirin group, neointimal lesions are significantly smaller than in the control group (0.14 mm2 versus 0.23 mm2; p less than 0.5).
 Thickenings of the tunica media are also reduced (0.11 mm2 versus 0.12 mm2; p less than 0.5).
 It is suggested that Aspirin reduces both medial hypertrophy and neointimal outgrowth in injury-induced atherosclerosis.

 Monolayer cultures of the human melanoma cell lines StML-12, StML-11, StML-14 (third, respectively, twenty-fifth subculture), and SKMel-28 derived from specimens representing different stages of tumor progression were treated with 10-10,000 U/ml rTNF-alpha applied for 72 h.
 The effects of rTNF-alpha on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, cell viability, cloning efficiency, cell division, cell morphology, and the immunophenotype were studied in triplicate experiments.
 The cell line StML-14(3) revealed a significantly dose-dependent reduction of growth due to both cytostatic and cytotoxic activities of rTNF-alpha as well as a decrease of CE.
 Increased numbers of cells in prophase were observed 24 h after addition of r-TNF-alpha.
 In addition, dislocation of chromosomes in the metaphase, formation of micronuclei, and dose-dependent increases of cells exhibiting micronuclei and the DNA amount per cell were detected at the end of treatment.
 On the other hand, only a slight sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effect of rTNF-alpha was observed with StML-14(25) and SKMel-28, whereas StML-12 and StML-11 were significantly resistant.
 The last four cell lines were serially subcultivated and presented common phenotypic patterns with more malignant characteristics than the cell line StML-14(3) before treatment.
 Overall, rTNF-alpha enhanced the malignant immunophenotype of the cell lines tested.
 It increased the expression of the ""late"" melanoma progression markers A.10.33 and A.1.43, and Ki67, and it decreased the expression of the ""early"" progression marker K.1.2.
 The expression of HLA-I, HLA-DR, and ICAM-1 was also enhanced after rTNF-alpha treatment, whereas in contrast to other cytokines, rTNF-alpha did not induce the de novo expression of HLA-DR in HLA-DR-negative melanoma cell lines.
 These findings indicate that rTNF-alpha induces cytostasis and decreases cell viability of certain rTNF-alpha-sensitive melanoma cells.
 These effects may result in selection of rTNF-alpha-non-sensitive human melanoma cell populations with higher proliferation rates and a more aggressive immunophenotype in vitro.

 There were no deaths in this series, no major complications, no known missed intra-abdominal injuries, and no delayed hemorrhage.
 While most liver injuries appear to heal rapidly by serial CT scans, a small percentage of these patients have residual liver defects persisting for several months and may be at risk for future complications.

1404,"Consistent involvement of the bcr gene by 9;22 breakpoints in pediatric acute leukemias.
 To investigate the relationship of bcr-abl fusion mRNAs with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), we examined 27 pediatric Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive acute leukemias using a reverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure.
 In cells from 24 leukemias, single bcr-abl PCR products were detected that corresponded to breakpoints in the minor breakpoint cluster region (mbcr in intron 1 of the bcr gene) associated with production of the P190 fusion protein.
 Cells from the three remaining leukemias contained breakpoints in the major breakpoint cluster region (Mbcr) as shown by PCR and Southern blot analyses.
 These three leukemias also contained low levels of the mbcr PCR product that may have resulted from alternative splicing of the bcr-abl precursor RNA.
 A screen of 35 additional leukemias from patients who failed therapy before day 180 (induction failures or early relapses) found one case with unsuccessful cytogenetics to express Mbcr-abl RNA.
 All four children with Mbcr breakpoints had white blood cell levels in excess of 250,000 at presentation (compared with 2 of 24 with mbcr breakpoints) and two had hematologic and clinical features suggestive of chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis.
 Our results indicate that in Ph1-positive pediatric leukemias, all 9;22 breakpoints occur in one of the two known breakpoint cluster regions in the bcr gene on chromosome 22.
 The reverse PCR reliably detected all patients with cytogenetic t(9;22) and is capable of detecting additional Ph1-positive leukemias that are missed by standard cytogenetics.
 Furthermore, the Mbcr-type breakpoint, associated with production of p210, can be seen in childhood leukemias presenting either as clinical ALL or as apparent lymphoid blast crisis of CML, suggesting that t(9;22) breakpoint locations do not exclusively determine the biologic and clinical features of pediatric Ph1-positive ALL.

 We compared the pulsatile secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) between 13 men with clinically and electrographically documented temporal lobe seizures and 8 age-matched controls.
 Serum for LH measurement was drawn every 15 minutes during 8 hours of EEG telemetry in both groups.
 The 2 groups did not differ significantly in average mean baseline LH secretion, total LH secretion, or average pulse amplitude.
 The group with seizures, however, showed a significantly greater (p less than 0.05) variability of baseline LH secretion and pulse frequency.
 Among the men with unilateral paroxysmal EEG findings, pulse frequency was significantly greater (p = 0.05) with right epileptiform discharges or left slowing (6.4 +/- 0.4) than with left epileptiform discharges or right slowing (3.0 +/- 1.3).
 The relationship of pulse frequency to the nature and laterality of paroxysmal discharges makes it unlikely that endocrine abnormalities can be attributed to medication alone and strengthens the notion that temporal lobe epileptiform discharges may disrupt hypothalamic regulation of pituitary secretion.

1406,"High incidence of antibodies to HTLV-I tax in blood relatives of adult T cell leukemia patients.
 Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is caused by the human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I).
 Although the mechanisms of the leukemogenic process are unknown, the tax gene may have a role in this process.
 Because clustering occurs with HTLV-I and ATL, members of ATL families were examined for antibodies to the tax protein and compared with matched HTLV-I-positive blood donors.
 To investigate the antibody response to this protein, a plasmid, pBHX-4, was constructed to express a recombinant tax protein (r-tax).
 For ATL patients and their HTLV-I antibody-positive blood relatives, the rate of seroreactivity with the r-tax protein was 67.3% (35/52), compared with 51.6% (97/188) for HTLV-I antibody-positive control blood donors (P less than .05).
 The difference between direct offspring of ATL patients and matched HTLV-I blood donors was even greater (84.2% [16/91] vs.
 44.2% [42/95]; P less than .005).
 Thus, tax antibody positivity in direct offspring of ATL patients may reflect differences in time or route of HTLV-I infection.
 Alternatively, it might reflect genetic differences in host susceptibility or virus strain.

 Group I patients had greater evidence of bilateral and multiple-site lesions than group II and III patients.
 Speed of left-hand finger tapping was also worse in Group I than groups II and III, but other standard neuropsychologic test findings failed to separate the groups.
 Specific brain lesion sites were not related to group membership.

 The feasibility of prefabricating free flaps by inducing, through the process of staged reconstruction, an arteriovenous bundle and its surrounding fascia to perfuse a selected block of tissue was investigated experimentally and clinically.
 Sixteen rat knee joints were wrapped with their ipsilateral superficial inferior epigastric (SIE) fascia.
 In 8 joints, the composite flaps were resected en bloc and were immediately replaced orthotopically pedicled upon the superficial inferior epigastric vessels.
 In the remaining joints, the resection and orthotopic transfer were performed 2 weeks later.
 Only the joints in the latter group, which benefited from the staging period, were found to be perfused.
 The long finger proximal interphalangeal joint of a child was reconstructed by the staged microvascular transfer of his second toe proximal interphalangeal joint.
 At the first stage, a temporalis fascia flap was wrapped around the toe proximal interphalangeal joint and revascularized to the dorsalis pedis vessels.
 Six weeks later, the joint and its temporalis fascia envelope were dissected, and the ""prefabricated"" joint flap was transferred to the hand and revascularized to the wrist vessels.
 Bony union progressed uneventfully with excellent recovery of the range of motion.
 We conclude that regardless of the indigenous vascular anatomy, an unlimited array of composite free flaps can be constructed and transferred based on induced large vascular pedicles.

 The aim of the present study was to characterize rat mucosal colonic cells harvested from the crypt continuum during differentiation and dimethylhydrazine-induced neoplasia.
 The collection of colonocytes was performed using a modified nonenzymatic isolation procedure based on Ca2+ chelation and gentle mechanical dissociation.
 Light and electron microscopy histomorphological examinations, [3H]thymidine incorporation studies, and activity gradients of alkaline phosphatase, thymidine kinase, and cytoskeleton-associated protein tyrosine kinase indicated that distinct cell populations were harvested from the various crypt regions in a temporal sequence mirroring their zonal and functional distribution in situ.
 After dimethylhydrazine administration, marked protein tyrosine kinase activity was noted in colonic cells harvested from upper crypt zones.
 The misplaced and sustained kinase activity preceded the actual polyp or tumor formation.
 This observation is consistent with the expansion of colonic proliferative compartments beyond allowable boundaries during the preneoplastic period.
 Companion studies in human colonic epithelial specimens corroborate the findings observed in normal and transformed murine colonocytes.
 It is believed that the characterization and manipulation of colonocytes using our in vitro model will provide important clues to the molecular events underlying the differentiation program and carcinogenic process in the colonic cell.

 The purpose of this investigation was to examine and compare the effects of both in vivo pretreatment and in vitro treatment with the neuroleptic agents droperidol, haloperidol, and trifluoperazine on skeletal muscle contracture using an in vitro model.
 Strips of normal rat diaphragm were challenged with succinylcholine and halothane (halothane: 1% and 3%) subsequent to either in vitro administration (10-100 microM) or in vivo pretreatment (0.35-2.80 mg/kg) with droperidol, haloperidol, or trifluoperazine.
 After equilibration, maximum increases in tension were recorded and mean data analyzed by analysis of variance (P less than 0.05).
 When either droperidol or trifluoperazine was administered in vivo, contracture values after exposure to succinylcholine and halothane were significantly decreased.
 After in vivo pretreatment with haloperidol or in vitro administration of droperidol, succinylcholine-induced contractures were significantly reduced; contractures subsequently induced by halothane did not significantly differ from that of controls.
 In vitro treatment with haloperidol and trifluoperazine, however, produced significant increases in tension in muscles exposed to succinylcholine and halothane.
 This study provides evidence that droperidol may be considered a safe anesthetic adjunct in malignant hyperthermia-susceptible patients, and, additionally, that caution should be exercised when interpreting results from studies in which contracture testing is performed on muscle from patients treated with neuroleptic agents.

 The objective of these experiments was to investigate the influence of activation of three second messenger systems (protein kinase-C, adenylate cyclase-cAMP, and calcium mobilization) on the secretion of pancreastatin (PST) and chromogranin-A (CGA) by a human pancreatic carcinoid cell line (BON) in tissue culture.
 Stimulation of protein kinase-C by a phorbol ester (0.025-7.5 microM) caused a significant dose-related release of PST (186 +/- 22-4271 +/- 228% over controls).
 Treatment of BON cells with graded doses of 8-bromo-cAMP (0.14-3.0 mM) and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; 0.01-1.0 mM) also stimulated a dose-related release of PST (107 +/- 22-284 +/- 28 and 16 +/- 12-1076 +/- 100% over controls, respectively).
 Incubation of BON cells with ionomycin (0.134-13.4 microM) increased the release of PST (102 +/- 15-554 +/- 21% over controls) in a dose-related manner.
 A combination of IBMX and ionomycin resulted in an additive effect, whereas treatment with a phorbol ester plus IBMX resulted in a synergistic effect on PST release.
 Pretreatment of BON cells with monensin, an agent that prevents processing of precursors to smaller peptides, significantly decreased PST, but not CGA, secretion in response to phorbol ester or ionomycin.
 These findings indicate that protein kinase-C, cAMP, and Ca2+ mobilization participate in CGA and PST secretion.
 Although the observation that secretions of PST and CGA in response to theophylline are quantitatively associated, the absence of a quantitative relationship in the release patterns of PST and CGA in response to phorbol ester and ionomycin do not support a simple precursor-product relationship between CGA and PST.
 The monensin experiments are consistent with the notion that PST is derived from CGA in BON cells.

 OBJECTIVE--To establish the prevalence of babies born before arrival at two local hospitals.
 To identify women at risk of giving birth before arrival, and the morbidity and mortality associated with such births.
 DESIGN--A case control study.
 Each baby born before arrival and its mother were compared with the next born in the hospital (random control), and one matched for gestation and birthweight, together with their mothers.
 SETTING--Two maternity units serving East Birmingham and Solihull.
 SUBJECTS--All babies (and their mothers) born before arrival at these hospitals from January 1983 to December 1987.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Perinatal mortality rates, patterns of perinatal morbidity, demographic, social and obstetric features of the mothers.
 RESULTS--137 (0.44%) of 31,140 consecutive births were before arrival at hospital (BBA group).
 The perinatal mortality rate in the BBA group was 58.4/1000 (8 deaths) compared with 10.1/1000 for all inborn babies (relative risk 5.8, 95% confidence interval 2.9-11.4).
 In the BBA group the mean birthweight of 3008 g was 212 g (95% CI 50-374 g) less than that in the random control group; the mean gestation of 266 days was 10 days less (95% CI 5.9-14.1 days) than in the random control group.
 Hypothermia was the commonest morbidity.
 Women delivered before arrival tended to be either multigravid inner city Asians living a long way from the hospital or unmarried unbooked younger white Europeans.
 CONCLUSIONS--The high perinatal mortality was related to immaturity and low birthweight, rather than to birth before arrival itself.
 Although groups of mothers at risk of delivery before arrival can be identified more information is needed to establish whether additional antenatal care would be beneficial for these women and their babies.

1418,"Transvascular intracardiac applications of a miniaturized phased-array ultrasonic endoscope. Initial experience with intracardiac imaging in piglets.
 BACKGROUND.
 Recent advances in miniaturization of phased-array and mechanical ultrasound devices have resulted in exploration of alternative approaches to cardiac and vascular imaging in the form of transesophageal or intravascular imaging.
 Preliminary efforts in adapting phased-array endoscopes designed for transesophageal use to a transvascular approach have used full-sized phased-array devices introduced directly into the right atrium in open-chested animals.
 The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a custom-made, very small phased-array endoscope for intracardiac imaging introduced intravascularly through a jugular venous approach in young piglets.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Experimental atrial septal defects created in four piglets (3-4 weeks old) had been closed with a buttoned atrial septal defect closure device consisting of an occluder in the left atrium and a counteroccluder in the right atrium.
 Five to 15 days after atrial septal defect closure, the piglets were returned to the experimental laboratory, where a 6.3-mm, 17-element, 5-MHz phased-array probe mounted on a 4-mm endoscope was introduced through a cutdown incision of the external jugular vein and advanced to the right atrium.
 From the right atrium all four cardiac chambers, their inflows and outflows, and all four valves were well imaged with minimal superior and inferior rotation.
 High-resolution imaging of the atrial septum defined with anatomical accuracy, later verified by autopsy, the exact placement of both the occluder and counteroccluder in the left and right sides of the atrial septal defects and the absence of any shunting across the atrial septum in any of the four animals.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Our efforts indicate that transvascular passage of small phased-array probes can be easily accomplished and is a promising technique for detailed visualization of cardiac structures.
 This approach may provide an alternative to transesophageal echocardiography, particularly for guiding interventional procedures such as placement of transcatheter closure devices in pediatric patients.

 By differential hybridization, three complementary DNAs designated as S3, S2, and SA were isolated, and the corresponding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were differentially expressed between the kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats.
 S3 is identical to cytochrome P450 IV A2.
 SA encoded a protein of 546 amino acid residues, and its carboxyl terminal region had a slight homology to luciferase.
 No homologous sequence has been reported in S2 sequences.
 S3 mRNA was about four times more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of 28-day-old SHR than in those of age-matched WKY rats, but there was no difference at age 16 weeks.
 A low NaCl diet positively modulated the expression of the S3 gene.
 S2 mRNA was almost undetectable in the kidneys of 28-day-old WKY rats but was clearly detected in those of age-matched SHR.
 The expression level of S2 mRNA in the livers of 16-week-old SHR was about five times higher than that of age-matched WKY rats.
 The expression of S2 mRNA in the livers was modulated by dietary NaCl and captopril.
 SA mRNA was more than 10 times more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of SHR than in those of WKY rats from age 4 weeks.
 With the administration of captopril, the expressions of SA mRNA in the livers of SHR were positively modulated.
 Because these three genes are not only differentially expressed between SHR and WKY rats but also related to sodium metabolism or blood pressure control, the identification of these genes may provide important probes to examine the mechanisms of hypertension.

1420,"Evidence for the functional binding in vivo of tumor rejection antigens to antigen-presenting cells in tumor-bearing hosts.
 Spleen cells of BALB/c mice bearing a syngeneic CSA1M fibrosarcoma were treated with anti-Thy-1.2 antibody plus C, yielding a T cell-depleted, APC-containing fraction.
 The APC-containing fraction was first tested for its capacity to present exogenous modified-self or another tumor (Meth A) Ag after in vitro pulsing.
 The results showed comparable Ag-presenting capacities to those obtained by APC-containing fraction from normal spleen cells, indicating that APC function is not affected in tumor-bearing mice.
 We next examined whether APC from CSA1M-bearing mice bind endogenously generated CSA1M tumor Ag onto its surfaces to stimulate tumor-specific T cells.
 Five rounds of inoculation of APC-containing fraction from CSA1M-bearing mice without further in vitro pulsing resulted in the induction of potent anti-CSA1M immune resistance.
 The involvement of anti-CSA1M T cells in the induction of anti-CSA1M immunity was excluded by the fact that the in vivo immunity was excluded by the fact that the in vivo immunity was delivered by Thy-1+ cell-depleted, but not by Thy-1+ cell-enriched fractions of spleen cells from CSA1M-bearing mice.
 Moreover, the failure of Sephadex G10-passed spleen cells to deliver anti-CSA1M resistance demonstrated the absolute requirement of APC for inducing the in vivo immunity.
 Finally, this in vivo resistance was found to be tumor specific, because APC fractions from CSA1M-bearing and Meth A-bearing BALB/c mice induced immune resistance selective against the corresponding tumor cell challenge.
 These results indicate that APC from tumor-bearing hosts can not only exert unaffected APC function against exogenous Ag, but also function to present tumor Ag generated endogenously in the tumor-bearing state and to produce tumor-specific immunity in vivo.

1422,"Basal cell carcinoma recurring after radiotherapy: a unique, difficult treatment subclass of recurrent basal cell carcinoma.
 Twenty-seven basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) recurring following radiation therapy alone or in addition to other treatment modalities were treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) from 1983 to 1989.
 Mean tumor size was 2.1 cm.
 Of the tumors, 70.4% arose in the mid-face region, 55.6% had undergone multiple previous treatment modalities.
 The present recurrence rate is 7.4% (mean follow-up: 25 months).
 Basal cell carcinoma recurring following radiotherapy deserves special subclassification among recurrent BCC.
 It is very difficult to eradicate, with high recurrence rates following standard surgical excision or further radiotherapy.
 Tumors are usually large, aggressive, and invasive.
 Most arise in the cosmetically crucial mid-face region, where extension into subcutaneous tissue planes is common.
 Mohs surgery, with its inherent abilities to examine all margins, map tumor extension, and conserve tissue, is uniquely suited to treatment of these difficult tumors.

1425,"Usefulness of pulsed Doppler ultrasound in detection of angiographically evident recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after arterial embolization treatment.
 Because hepatocellular carcinoma treated by transcatheter arterial embolization often regains its size, routine follow-up is necessary.
 The usefulness of pulsed Doppler ultrasound for detection of this type of recurrence was compared with ultrasonography and computed tomography in 21 such hepatocellular carcinomas.
 Of 15 hepatocellular carcinomas diagnosed by angiography as showing recurrence, four were detected with ultrasonography and five were detected with computed tomography.
 Doppler signals were obtained in the peripheral portions corresponding to tumor vessels or stains on angiograms in 14 of these 15 hepatocellular carcinomas, but they were undetectable in six hepatocellular carcinomas with no recurrence.
 All signals disappeared after transcatheter arterial embolization.
 One false-negative hepatocellular carcinoma with pulsed Doppler ultrasound showed faint tumor stains on angiograms; these were also negative on ultrasonography and computed tomography.
 Pulsed Doppler ultrasound may be superior to ultrasonography and computed tomography as a routine procedure to detect the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma treated by transcatheter arterial embolization.

 Results of percutaneous balloon cholangioplasty of 17 patients with 28 benign biliary strictures were compared with those of published radiologic and surgical series to determine whether stricture location was related to therapeutic success and whether a patient should undergo percutaneous or surgical therapy.
 Treatment was considered successful if there was no anatomic evidence of recurrent stricture or need for surgery (mean follow-up, 32 months).
 Treatment was successful in all nine (100%) intrahepatic (zone 1) strictures, 11 of 12 (92%) extrahepatic-extrapancreatic (zone 2) strictures, one of three (33%) intrapancreatic (zone 3) strictures, and three of four (75%) bilienteric anastomotic (zone 4) strictures.
 Restenosis occurred in five patients; cholangioplasty was ultimately successful in two of those patients after redilation and stent placement.
 On the basis of these results and those of published radiologic and surgical series, the authors believe that cholangioplasty is the treatment of choice for zone 1 strictures and is as effective as surgery for zone 2 and 4 strictures.
 Patients with zone 2 and 4 strictures with concomitant portal hypertension or a history of multiple previous biliary surgical procedures should be considered good candidates for cholangioplasty.

 Cytologic features of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been well documented.
 Most previous reports described only the the morphologic features of the tumor cells without considering the sinusoidal stroma.
 Cytohistologic correlation on tissue from the same aspirate has rarely been done.
 This report describes the cytologic patterns of 50 cases of HCC in terms of histologic pattern observed in cell blocks prepared from the same aspiration specimen and classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.
 Tumors were classified according to the predominant pattern.
 Thirty-two cases gave the trabecular pattern.
 Smears could be subdivided into a central-sinusoidal pattern (23 cases) and a peripheral-sinusoidal pattern (nine cases).
 One case gave the pseudoglandular pattern.
 Seventeen cases gave the compact pattern with inconspicuous sinusoids.
 In all cases sinusoids were easily recognized in cell block sections.
 Other cytologic features such as intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions, eosinophilic globules, and bile secretion could be seen in both smears and cell blocks.
 Mallory's hyalin and ground glass inclusions were only recognized in cell blocks.
 More attention should be paid to the sinusoidal stroma for diagnosis of HCC in FNA; cell blocks should be more widely utilized to this effect; cytologic patterns could be classified according to the WHO histologic classification.

 A group of six patients with hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium less than or equal to 0.5 mmol/L), previously given treatment with cisplatin for ovarian or testicular cancer, received calcitriol at a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 microgram/day for a period of 4 weeks to determine whether treatment with this vitamin D metabolite could improve their hypomagnesemia.
 In response to treatment, the serum magnesium concentration fell progressively in association with a rise in serum and urinary calcium levels and a decrease in parathyroid hormone level.
 In a single previous report, active vitamin D metabolites markedly improved renal magnesium wasting.
 However, in the present study, increases in serum and urinary calcium levels and suppression of parathyroid hormone, factors known to decrease magnesium reabsorption, presumably overwhelmed any direct effect calcitriol may have had to enhance magnesium reabsorption, so that the net effect was a marked exacerbation of the renal magnesium wasting.

 Using the dopamine D2 receptor clone lambda hD2G1, Blum et al recently found that the D2/Taq I allele (A1) was present in 69% of 35 deceased alcoholics but in only 20% of an equal number of controls.
 To assess this association further, we evaluated the D2/Taq I polymorphism and a single-strand conformation polymorphism detected by polymerase chain reaction and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (PCR-SSCP) of the 3' noncoding region of the D2 receptor gene.
 We studied 40 unrelated white alcoholics, 127 racially matched controls, and two white pedigrees.
 The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime Version (SADS-L) clinical diagnostic interviews were rated blindly by two clinicians.
 The SADS-L interviews and other data were then used to ascertain diagnoses according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition (DSM-III-R) criteria.
 Alcoholics were subtyped according to age of onset, severity, presence of antisocial personality, and family history.
 No significant differences in either D2/Taq I or PCR-SSCP allele frequencies were observed between alcoholics, subpopulations of alcoholics, or controls.
 The PCR-SSCP polymorphism provided independent information against linkage at the D2 receptor locus.
 Several recombinants between the D2/Taq I locus and alcoholism were observed in two white families with an alcoholic parent who possessed the A1 allele.
 This study does not support a widespread or consistent association between the D2 receptor gene and alcoholism.

1432,"Massive transfusion: outcome in blunt trauma patients.
 Over a 54-month period 6,142 patients were consecutively admitted to our Level I trauma center.
 Ninety-two blunt trauma patients required massive transfusion (MT) of 20 or more units of packed red blood cells (range, 20-126).
 Eighty-two per cent of all transfused blood was given within 24 hours of admission.
 Forty-eight patients (52%) were long-term survivors.
 Twenty-six patients died (28%) within 24 hours and 21 of these exsanguinated.
 Eighteen patients died greater than 24 hours: nine (50%) died from multiple organ failure, and nine (50%) died from severe closed head injury (CHI).
 Clinical predictors of increased mortality were: shock on admission, closed head injury, and age.
 Forty-three survivors were followed for a mean of 2.5 years (range, 1-5 years).
 No patient died during followup.
 All patients were home at 1 year; only four patients required continued medical assistance.
 Thirty-two patients (74%) returned to work.
 We conclude that: 1) blunt and penetrating trauma patients receiving MT have similar survival rates of 50%; 2) shock, closed head injury, and age predict increased mortality but do not preclude survival; 3) long-term outcome in blunt patients requiring MT is excellent.
 Post-discharge death is rare and 3/4 of the survivors return to work, justifying the high cost of acute care.

 OBJECTIVES: Systemic administration of atropine during CPR may postpone brain death determination because of its reputed ability to produce fixed and dilated pupils.
 We studied the effect of atropine administered in the usual doses as an adjunct to endotracheal intubation and for cardiac arrest to determine if it would interfere with neurological assessment.
 DESIGN: Two groups of children were studied.
 Group 1 consisted of 28 patients who received atropine (0.03 +/- 0.003 mg/kg) prior to endotracheal intubation.
 Group 2 consisted of 21 patients previously without evidence of brainstem disease who suffered a witnessed arrest and had prompt return of spontaneous circulation and received an atropine dose of 0.03 +/- 0.01 mg/kg.
 RESULTS: In group 1, pupillary size averaged 4.02 +/- 0.78 mm before and 4.75 mm +/- .84 mm after atropine (P less than .001).
 In group 2, the pupillary examination was conducted 30 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation.
 The pupillary diameter was 4.80 +/- 0.91 mm.
 All pupils were reactive to light in both groups.
 CONCLUSION: Atropine administration in conventional dose causes slight pupillary dilation but does not abolish pupillary light reactivity.

 Controversies remain about the bacteriologic aspects of intraoperative blood salvage despite the widespread use of this technique.
 In this prospective study, intraoperative salvaged blood was cultured in 401 patients, according to a direct plating technique.
 Bacterial growth was detected in 12.7% of cases.
 These results were compared with those obtained in control studies with sterile water and blood bank units under the same culture conditions.
 Most microorganisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by other skin and environmental contaminants.
 Quantitative estimates of contaminations showed low counts of colony-forming units (CFU/ml): 82% of positive cultures yielded 1 or 2 CFU/ml and 6% had 5 to 20 CFU/ml.
 Patients were followed up for a minimum of 3 months to detect septic complications.
 No statistically significant correlation could be found between bacteriologic results of autotransfused blood and infectious complications.
 This study suggests that bacteriologic monitoring of patients who have undergone autotransfusion may help in detecting surgical field contamination.
 It also confirms that intraoperative autotransfusion adds little septic risk to cardiac surgery.

 Individual AEDs have been shown to differ--the deleterious effects of phenytoin generally contrasting with the relatively minimal effects of valproate and carbamazepine.
 Some of the differences between results may be attributed to the psychological tests used and to age differences.
 However, there appears to be a dissociation between AEDs that affect higher cognitive function, e.g., phenytoin, and those mainly affecting motor function, e.g., carbamazepine, which appears to increase speed of performance, AEDs should be prescribed with care in children with epilepsy, taking account of their differing effects on cognitive function and behavior.

 The isolated effect of cooling the pulmonary circulation on ventilation was quantified in nine anesthetized dogs.
 The right pulmonary artery (RPA) was cannulated within the pericardium, and systemic blood was pumped from the left atrium to the RPA between, but not during, periods of cooling.
 Cooled blood boluses were injected into the RPA under conditions in which either bolus temperature (5-35 degrees C) or volume (0-1.5 ml/kg body wt) varied.
 Inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), breath duration (TT), and peak integrated activity (PEAK) were determined from diaphragm EMG.
 Results for five postinjection breaths were converted to a percent of the values from five preinjection breaths.
 There was a linear relationship between bolus temperature and TI [r = 0.61, slope (x) = 0.59%/degrees C, P less than 0.001), TE (r = 0.73, x = 1.43%/degrees C, P less than 0.001] as well as TT (r = 0.74, x = 1.10%/degrees C, P less than 0.001), whereas PEAK was unaffected (n = 9).
 When injection temperature was 5 degrees C, an inverse linear relationship existed between bolus volume and TI (r = 0.75, x = -15.2%.ml-1.kg-1, P less than 0.001) and TE (r = 0.78, x = -23.4%.ml-1.kg-1, P less than 0.001) (n = 4).
 In two dogs tested the effect of bolus injection was minimal at residual volume and progressively increased with lung volume.

 We report the validation and use of a cell hybrid panel which allowed us a rapid physical localization of new DNA probes in the vicinity of the fragile-X locus (FRAXA).
 Seven regions are defined by this panel, two of which lie between DXS369 and DXS296, until now the closest genetic markers that flank FRAXA.
 Of those two interesting regions, one is just distal to DXS369 and defined by probe 2-71 (DXS476), which is not polymorphic.
 The next one contains probes St677 (DXS463) and 2-34 (DXS477), which are within 130 kb and both detect TaqI RFLPs.
 The combined informativeness of these two probes is 30%.
 We cloned from an irradiation-reduced hybrid line another new polymorphic probe, Do33 (DXS465; 42% heterozygosity).
 This probe maps to the DXS296 region, proximal to a chromosomal breakpoint that corresponds to the Hunter syndrome locus (IDS).
 The physical order is thus Cen-DXS369-DXS476-(DXS463,DXS477)-(DXS296, DXS465)-IDS-DXS304-tel.
 We performed a linkage analysis for five of these markers in both the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families and in a large set of fragile-X families.
 This establishes that DXS296 is distal to FRAXA.
 The relative position of DXS463 and DXS477 with respect to FRAXA remains uncertain, but our results place them genetically halfway between DXS369 and DXS304.
 Thus the DXS463-DXS477 cluster defines presently either the closest proximal or the closest distal polymorphic marker with respect to FRAXA.
 The three new polymorphic probes described here have a combined heterozygosity of 60% and represent a major improvement for genetic analysis of fragile-X families, in particular for diagnostic applications.

 Understanding spontaneous fluctuations in ventricular tachycardia cycle length is required to develop algorithms for ventricular tachycardia detection and termination.
 Variations in cycle length, time to stable cycle length and the range of RR intervals during ventricular tachycardia were analyzed in 74 episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced in patients not taking antiarrhythmic medication.
 Linear regression demonstrated cycle length variability to decrease over time (41 +/- 24 to 17 +/- 19 ms, p less than 0.001).
 Slower ventricular tachycardia had more cycle length variability than faster ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.001).
 Ventricular tachycardia that was initially more variable tended to remain more variable (p less than 0.001).
 Fifty-four percent of episodes stabilized within the first 15 beats, 75% by 30 beats and 93% by 50 beats.
 The number of beats to stable cycle length was independent of ventricular tachycardia rate.
 The average range in cycle length per episode was 127 +/- 72 ms; 12% of ventricular tachycardia episodes varied by less than 50 ms and 45% by less than 150 ms.
 The maximal range in RR intervals from a single episode of ventricular tachycardia was 290 ms.
 Therefore, ventricular tachycardia demonstrates a wide range of cycle lengths and has time-dependent changes in variability and stability.
 These cycle length changes should be considered in the algorithms for ventricular tachycardia detection and termination by automatic antitachycardia devices.

 Vascular injury and platelet accumulation after balloon angioplasty are two potentially important triggers of the process of restenosis that may be minimized by the use of laser energy to ablate atherosclerotic plaque.
 The type of laser most suitable to achieve these goals remains unknown.
 Accordingly, angiographic and histologic studies and quantitative platelet deposition analysis were performed on 27 atherosclerotic rabbit iliac arteries randomized to treatment with excimer laser or thermal laser angioplasty.
 Excimer laser angioplasty was achieved with 35 to 40 mJ/mm2 of 308 nm xenon chloride irradiation delivered through a 4.5F catheter made of 13 concentrically arranged 200 microns fiber optics, at a repetition rate of 25 to 30 Hz and a pulse duration of 135 ns; thermal laser angioplasty was achieved with a 1.7 mm metal probe heated with 10 W of continuous wave argon laser energy.
 The baseline and post-laser luminal diameters of excimer laser-treated vessels (0.92 +/- 0.28 and 1.56 +/- 0.48 mm, respectively) were similar to those observed in thermal laser-treated vessels (1.05 +/- 0.44 and 1.61 +/- 0.41 mm, respectively).

 A marked decrease in the type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit (RI alpha) and an increase in the type II protein kinase regulatory subunit (RII beta) correlate with growth inhibition and differentiation induced in a variety of types of human cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo, by site-selective cAMP analogs.
 To directly determine whether RI alpha is a growth-inducing protein essential for neoplastic cell growth, human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were exposed to 21-mer RI alpha antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, and the effects on cell replication and differentiation were examined.
 The RI alpha antisense oligomer brought about growth inhibition and monocytic differentiation, bypassing the effects of an exogenous cAMP analog.
 These effects of RI alpha antisense oligodeoxynucleotide correlated with a decrease in RI alpha receptor and an increase in RII beta receptor level.
 The growth inhibition and differentiation were abolished, however, when these cells were exposed simultaneously to both RI alpha and RII beta antisense oligodeoxynucleotides.
 The RII beta antisense oligodeoxynucleotide alone has been previously shown to specifically block the differentiation inducible by cAMP analogs.
 These results provide direct evidence that RI alpha cAMP receptor plays a critical role in neoplastic cell growth and that cAMP receptor isoforms display specific roles in cAMP regulation of cell growth and differentiation.

 When only IERM was considered, SD records showed a significantly higher number of BETS per unit of time (7.36 +/- 1.1) than did non-SD records (3.89 +/- 0.69) (p less than 0.01).
 Our findings support the general consensus that individual BETS may be normal variants, but a high occurrence of BETS in the record should raise suspicion of underlying epilepsy.

1450,"Local reactions to radioiodine in the treatment of thyroid cancer.
 PURPOSE: To compare the rate of local complications resulting from radioiodine ablation of thyroid cancer in patients with a residual intact thyroid lobe to that in patients who had more extensive surgical treatment prior to radioiodine administration.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 59 patients who had received 131I between 1979 and 1989.
 The patients were divided into two groups, depending on the extent of their previous surgical thyroid excision.
 Group 1 comprised 10 patients with a lobectomy or hemithyroidectomy before the ablative radioiodine dose, and Group 2 comprised 49 patients with more extensive thyroid excision (near-total or subtotal thyroidectomy) before the radioiodine treatment.
 RESULTS: Sixty percent of the 10 patients in Group 1 experienced some degree of neck pain or tenderness following radioiodine ablation of their residual thyroid.
 In one case, the local reaction was very severe and accompanied by the development of transient hyperthyroidism.
 There was only a 6% local complication rate in the patients who had undergone more extensive thyroid excision before ablative therapy (p less than 0.001), and none had a severe reaction.
 CONCLUSIONS: Patients with only unilateral surgical excision before radioiodine therapy have a higher rate of local complications than do patients treated with more extensive surgery prior to radioiodine ablation.
 If radioiodine is to be employed in such patients, they should be informed of this possible complication.
 Since evidence supports a dose effect in the pathogenesis of the complications, we recommend using a dose of less than 30 mCi for the initial ablation in these patients even though it may be necessary to repeat this dose to complete thyroid ablation.

1451,"Recovery time of independent function post-stroke.
 Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function.
 Of the 93 patients admitted, there were 45 who could not attain the sitting position independently, 75 who could not walk independently and 75 who could not negotiate the stairs independently.
 By discharge, 25 of 45 patients (55.6%) were able to attain sitting from supine independently, 35 of 75 patients (46.7%) achieved the ability to walk independently but only 25 of 75 patients (33.3%) learned to negotiate stairs independently.
 The time from admission to achievement of independent function and the time from onset of stroke to achievement of independent function was modeled in relation to explanatory variables: age, sex, side of lesion, comorbidity, the presence of depression and the extent of impairment in perception, cognition, auditory comprehension and verbal expression.
 Four variables were found to influence recovery time: age influenced the rate of recovery of walking and stair climbing; perceptual impairment influenced the rate of achieving independent sitting and stair climbing; and depression and comprehension influenced walking.

1452,"Senescence of nickel-transformed cells by an X chromosome: possible epigenetic control.
 Transfer of a normal Chinese hamster X chromosome (carried in a mouse A9 donor cell line) to a nickel-transformed Chinese hamster cell line with an Xq chromosome deletion resulted in senescense of these previously immortal cells.
 At early passages of the A9/CX donor cells, the hamster X chromosome was highly active, inducing senescence in 100% of the colonies obtained after its transfer into the nickel-transformed cells.
 However, senescence was reduced to 50% when Chinese hamster X chromosomes were transferred from later passage A9 cells.
 Full senescing activity of the intact hamster X chromosome was restored by treatment of the donor mouse cells with 5-azacytidine, which induced demethylation of DNA.
 These results suggest that a senescence gene or genes, which may be located on the Chinese hamster X chromosome, can be regulated by DNA methylation, and that escape from senescence and possibly loss of tumor suppressor gene activity can occur by epigenetic mechanisms.

 A spontaneously transformed murine keratinocyte cell line (PAM cell) was found to secrete two nondisulfide-linked collagenous polypeptides with apparent molecular weight (MW) 190-kd and 120-kd.
 Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the 190-kd polypeptide was secreted into the culture medium in 2 h and processed to the 120-kd collagen component within 4 h.
 This process was inhibited by EDTA.
 The 120-kd polypeptide was sensitive to pepsin, and a 50-kd fragment was produced by a mild pepsin treatment at 4 degrees C.
 A cyanogen bromide peptide map of the 120-kd polypeptide was distinct from that of types I, II, III, IV, and V collagens.
 These properties indicate similarities to the type VIII-related collagen produced by human astrocytoma cells.
 The secretion of the collagen rapidly reached a maximum level on the first day of culture and subsequently declined with cell proliferation.
 An accelerated processing to the 120-kd polypeptide was observed under culture conditions of high cell density.
 Similar collagens were also found to be produced by normal human keratinocytes.
 These results indicate that the 120-kd polypeptide is a potentially functional protein that may participate in the formation of the extracellular matrix of keratinocytes.

 1.
 Blood cells and vascular endothelial cells are subjected to a wide range of haemodynamically generated shear stress forces.
 In vitro, membrane stretching or shear stress have been observed to activate ion channels and cell metabolism and to facilitate erythrocyte and platelet aggregation.
 2.
 The present study was designed to evaluate the participation of shear stresses in the control of apparent platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in hypertensive patients.
 3.
 Shear conditions and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro were studied after a dynamic perturbation induced by 3 months of double-blind treatment with one of two beta-antagonists, carteolol and atenolol.
 Brachial artery wall shear rate and stress were estimated by means of a pulsed Doppler velocimeter, and blood viscosity was measured by a co-axial viscometer at a shear rate of 96 s-1.
 Platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was simultaneously measured by using the Quin-2 fluorescent chelator.
 The direct effect of atenolol and carteolol on platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro was also measured after addition of the beta-blockers to platelet-rich plasma.
 4.
 Atenolol and carteolol decreased blood pressure similarly but their effects on shear rate (P less than 0.02), shear stress (P less than 0.01) and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (P less than 0.05) differed after 3 months of therapy.
 In contrast, neither of the drugs significantly altered platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, in vitro per se.
 5.
 In the overall population, strong positive correlations existed not only between changes in platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and those in shear rate (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) and shear stress (r = 0.83, P less than 0.001), but also between their absolute values, suggesting a possible haemodynamic shear-dependent modulation of transmembrane Ca2+ transport.

1457,"Predicting recurrence time of esophageal carcinoma through assessment of histologic factors and DNA ploidy.
 Cytophotometric analysis of nuclear DNA content was done in 128 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
 The relationship among histopathologic features, DNA distribution pattern, and survival time was investigated from the standpoint of recurrence.
 Of 128 patients, 77 (60.1%) died of recurrence within 2 years after surgery: 16 (12.5%) from 2 to 5 years and two (1.6%) over 5 years.
 The rate of death of recurrence within 2 years was higher in patients with T4 or N1 than T1, T2, and T3 or N0 (P less than 0.01).
 Survivors over 5 years more frequently possessed type II DNA pattern than types III and IV (P less than 0.05).
 The rate of death of recurrence within 2 years was 34.4% in type II, which was lower than the 59.6% rate in type III (P less than 0.05) and the 76.6% rate in type IV (P less than 0.01).
 Survivors from 2 to 5 years were higher in type III than in type IV (P less than 0.05), and recurrence over 5 years was found only in type II.
 This inclination was more apparent in those with curative resection.
 In the patients with type II, careful follow-up may be needed over 5 years for late recurrence.
 However, in those with type IV, no recurrence over 2 years could be regarded as healed because most of their recurrences occur within 2 years.
 These findings suggest that the growth rate of esophageal carcinoma should reflect DNA aneuploidy, and the DNA analysis of esophageal carcinoma should be a valuable parameter for postoperative follow-up planning.

 The annual mortality from aortic valvular stenosis was calculated among potential candidates for surgical replacement of the aortic valve.
 From the Swedish Central Register of Causes of Death, 70 patients below the age of 80 years who had died from aortic stenosis during a 1-year period in the County of Stockholm (population 1.5 million), were identified.
 A retrospective analysis of their medical records showed that 37 individuals were suitable candidates for surgery.
 The presence of aortic stenosis had been verified at autopsy in 31 (84%) patients.
 The remaining six patients (16%) had their aortic stenosis diagnosis established by a thorough non-invasive investigation performed before death.
 Although typical signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis were recorded in all 37 patients, only six (16%) of them had been considered by their physicians to be suitable candidates for surgery prior to death.
 The deceased patients were compared with a group of 68 patients who had undergone aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis during the same period.
 There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to symptoms and clinical findings, except for a higher incidence of syncope in the operated group.
 It is concluded that, of 105 (68 surgically treated and 37 deceased) eligible patients with aortic stenosis, 37 individuals did not receive surgical care in time.
 The reason for this was probably insufficient knowledge of the curability of the disease.

 The effect of prehospital intravenous fluids upon survival was studied in 6,855 trauma patients.
 Mean prehospital time was 36 minutes in both the group of patients who received fluids and the group that did not.
 The volume of fluid administered was not significantly different in the group who survived compared to those who died.
 Eighty-five per cent of the patients had an Injury Severity Score (ISS) less than 25 and the mortality rate in the 56% of patients in this group who received fluids was similar to that of the patients who did not receive fluids (0.7% vs.
 0.5%).
 Twelve per cent of the patients had an ISS between 25 and 50.
 Sixty per cent of these patients received fluids and the mortality rates were similar to the patients who received fluids compared to those who did not (23% vs.
 22%).
 Three per cent of patients had an ISS of greater than 50 and the mortality rate was highest in this group but was not influenced by the administration of fluids (90% vs.

 Comparison of groups with similar probability of survival according to the TRISS methodology also failed to show an influence of fluid administration on survival.
 The mortality rate in patients with an initial systolic blood pressure (BP) of 90 torr or greater was compared to the rate in patients with an admission BP less than 90 torr.
 Although hypotension was associated with a significantly higher mortality rate, the administration of fluids had no influence on this rate.

 Positron labeled substrates such as sugars, amino acids, and nucleosides have been investigated for the in-vivo evaluation of biochemical processes in cancerous tissue.
 Hexosamines are obligatory structural components of many biologically important macromolecules, including membrane glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharide.
 We evaluated a new synthesized pharmaceutical, N-[18F]fluoroacetyl-D-glucosamine (18F-FAG), which is a structural analog of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
 C3H/HeMsNRS mice bearing spontaneous hepatomas were used for the tissue distribution study.
 At 60 min after injection, high uptakes were found in tumor (5.16, mean value of %dose/g), liver (3.71), and kidney (3.27).
 The tumor uptake of 18F-FAG showed the highest value in all tissue.
 In the PET study, VX-2 carcinoma of the rabbit was clearly visualized.

 For these tumor diameter groups a six-fold eliminatory curability analysis was performed.
 Of the patients with liver metastases in group 1 the last patient had died at 10 months and in groups 2 and 3 no patients were alive at 18 months after the start of complaints.
 Patients with extrahepatic metastases did not survive 12 months in group 1, 16 months in group 2, and 25 months in group 3.
 The 6% actuarial survival rate for inoperable patients was reached in group 1 after 17 months, in group 2 after 36 months, and in group 3 after 27 months after the start of complaints.
 For groups 1 through 3 in curable, but not curatively operated patients, the respective 0% actuarial survival rate was reached at 24 months, 23 months, and 14 months.
 The 0% actuarial survival rate in patients with irresectable vessel invasion was reached in group 1 at 33 months, in group 2 at 23 months, and in group 3 at 25 months.
 The 0% actuarial survival rate in patients with an irresectable tumor was reached at 33 months, 31 months, and 27 months after the start of complaints in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

 In group 1 25% of the patients were alive at 36 months after the start of complaints.
 Small tumors were associated with the greatest chance of curative operation and on average had the longest survival.
 However, small tumors with liver or other metastases carried a worse prognosis than large tumors with liver or other metastases.
 If tumors were found not to be resectable at the time of operation, the size of the tumor did not appear to affect survival.

 A clinical lesion study and intraoperative epidural recordings were made to test the origin and clinical significance of the spinal N13 and P13 of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) that follow median nerve stimulation.
 Intraoperatively, the respective peak latencies of spinal P13 and N13 coincided with those of the N1 component of the dorsal cord potential and its phase reversed positivity.
 On both the ventral and dorsal sides of the cervical epidural space, maximal amplitude was at the C5 vertebral level to which nerve input from the C6 dermatome is the main contributor.
 The modality of sensory impairment in the hand dermatome was examined in selected patients with cervical lesions, who showed such normal conventional SEP components as Erb N9, far-field P9, P11, P14, N18 and cortical N20, with or without loss of spinal N13.
 Statistically, the loss of spinal N13 was associated with decrease of pain sensation in the C6 dermatome.
 This was interpreted as being due to damage to the central grey matter of the cord, including the dorsal horn.
 Our results suggest the spinal N13 and P13 originate from the same source in the C6 spinal cord segment and that they are good indicators for the detection of centromedullary cervical cord damage.

 With a laparoscopic approach, patients can undergo cholecystectomy with a shorter hospitalization, minimal pain, and quicker recovery.
 It has not been demonstrated, however, that patients actually return to work after laparoscopic cholecystectomy faster than the traditional 4- to 6-week absence from work after a standard open procedure.
 A survey of 104 French and 84 American patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy revealed that postoperative discomfort was completely resolved in 2 weeks in 73% of French and 93% of American patients.
 All but 11 French and 5 American patients were back to normal home activities by 2 weeks after the operation.
 Of the 35 American and 40 French patients who had professional activity outside the home, 63% and 25%, respectively, returned to work within 14 days.
 Five (14%) of the American patients and 12 (30%) of the French patients returned to work 4 weeks or more after the operation.
 The amount of physical activity on the job correlated with the period off work, but, interestingly, at least six patients with very hard physical activity at work (including construction workers) were able to return to full work activity within 1 week.
 These data suggest that early return to work is possible and that pain resolves quickly after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 The economic benefit of having patients back on the job quickly, however, may be less than expected until cultural norms change with regard to leave of absence after major surgery.

 Using in vivo brain microdialysis, we studied amino acid release in the striatum and cortex of eight rats following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion.
 We then processed all brains for histopathologic assessment of the volume of ischemic damage 4 hours after occlusion.
 Ischemic damage was varied by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery at a point either proximal (n = 4) or distal (n = 4) to the lenticulostriate vessels.
 Proximal occlusion elevated the dialysate contents of all amino acids.
 The largest increases occurred for the potentially neurotoxic amino acids aspartate and glutamate and for taurine (800-2,800% of basal efflux).
 We observed smaller increases for the ""metabolic"" amino acids (280-580% of basal efflux).
 Distal occlusion did not affect amino acid efflux in the striatum, and release in the cortex was significantly lower than that following proximal occlusion.
 We compared release data with acute histopathologic outcome.
 Proximal occlusion resulted in a large volume of ischemic damage in the cortex and striatum (25-48% of hemispheric volume).
 A smaller volume of ischemic damage was noted following distal occlusion (0-21% of hemispheric volume).

 To determine the relevance of recent refinements in angioplasty technology to our particular practice, the records of 507 consecutive patients undergoing a first percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) at our center between October 1988 and May 1989 were reviewed.
 At the time of PTCA, 41% of these patients had class IV angina and 44% were identified as having multivessel disease.
 Dilatation was attempted in 734 lesions (mean 1.5 per patient), of which 95 (13%) were chronic total occlusions.
 Overall, 69% of the 734 lesions were judged anatomically complex, and, in dilating these lesions, a rail-type device was used almost exclusively.
 Successful dilatation was achieved in 659 of the 734 (90%) attempted lesions.
 There were low incidences of the major complications of death (0.4%), myocardial infarction (1.8%) and emergency bypass surgery (1.8%).
 Acute rethrombosis occurred in 54 patients (11%).
 In these patients, initial strategy of repeat dilatation was successful in 38 of 47 patients (81%).
 Overall, primary clinical success at PTCA was achieved in 480 patients (95%).

 The recent increase in popularity of selective posterior rhizotomy demands objective documentation of surgical outcome.
 For this reason, the authors have analyzed the status of 25 children with spastic cerebral palsy before and after rhizotomy to determine the effects of this therapy on muscle tone, range of movement, and motor function.
 Postoperative tests showed a reduction in muscle tone compared with preoperative assessments.
 Range of motion in the lower extremities was significantly increased and improvements in functional gross motor skills were noted.
 An increase in range of motion in the knees and thighs during gait was detected in 18 ambulatory patients studied with computerized two-dimensional motion analysis.

 Since Harold Brown, in 1950, described the superior oblique tendon sheath syndrome, numerous surgical techniques have been explored to treat this condition.

 However, good functional results are rarely achieved in a single procedure, and delayed complications are frequent.
 Taking advantage of the improved dissection and reduced trauma afforded by the use of a surgical microscope, one of the techniques first recommended and later abandoned by Brown was reappraised.
 The technique consists of dissection of the sheath and attachments of the superior oblique, while preserving its tendon, combined with a 10mm tuck of the homolateral inferior oblique.

 The exact time of onset of functional expansion after acute myocardial infarction/ischemia remains unclear in spite of its potential link to chronic pathologic infarct expansion and its potential implications for therapy.
 To examine this early change in ventricular morphology, 14 open-chest dogs were studied with two-dimensional echocardiography before and after occlusion (10 minutes) of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD, n = 7) or circumflex artery (CIRC, n = 7).
 The endocardial surface area (ESA) and the area of abnormal wall motion (AWM) were reconstructed from the echocardiographic data using a previously reported technique for quantitatively mapping the ESA and extent of AWM.
 For the total group (N = 14), the mean ESA before occlusion was 48.9 +/- 9.8 cm2, increasing to 65.7 +/- 18.9 cm2 at 10 minutes occlusion (p less than 0.001).
 For the LAD subgroup, the mean ESA before occlusion was 50.7 +/- 9.3 cm2, increasing to 79.1 +/- 14.1 cm2 at 10 minutes following occlusion (p less than 0.001).
 For the CIRC subgroup, the mean ESA before occlusion was 47.1 +/- 10.8 cm2, increasing to 52.3 +/- 12.6 cm2 at 10 minutes after occlusion (p less than 0.001).
 The ESA increase for the LAD subgroup was significantly larger than that of the CIRC subgroup (LAD range 14.5 to 49.9 cm2 versus CIRC range 1.5 to 9 cm2, p less than 0.0001).
 Coronary occlusion resulted in similarly sized regions of AWM for both subgroups (LAD, 31.3 +/- 12.2 cm2 versus CIRC, 25.9 +/- 10.3 cm2, p = n.s.).
 For the LAD group, the largest increase in endocardial circumference occurred within the zone of AWM at the apex (39.9 +/- 12%).
 The endocardial surface area therefore expands immediately after coronary occlusion and the magnitude of this process is primarily related to the site (anteroapical) rather than to the extent of AWM.

 The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) on the immune response are still conflicting.
 To elucidate the effects of CBZ on some immunologic parameters, serum concentrations of IgA, IgG, IgM, the phagocytosis and killing properties of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells and the response of lymphocytes to mitogenic agents were studied.
 Forty healthy individuals and 39 epileptic patients treated with carbamazepine (CBZ) monotherapy (age range 18-40 years) entered the study.
 Student's t test was used to evaluate the data.
 CBZ had no effect on the serum immunoglobulin concentrations or on lymphocytic reactivity to phytohemoagglutinin (PHA) mitogen.
 CBZ produced a significant enhancement of phagocytosis and killing properties of PMNs and an increase in natural killer (NK) cell activity.
 Therefore, a negative effect of CBZ therapy on the immune system was not observed in this study.

 We continuously observed successive pairs of R-R intervals during atrial fibrillation and hypothesized that the shortest R-R interval for a given preceding R-R interval in a pair represents the functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node at that preceding interval.
 To test this hypothesis we simulated atrial fibrillation in 28 isolated cross-perfused canine hearts and obtained an R-R interval scatterplot by plotting the R-R intervals as a function of the immediately preceding R-R interval.
 This scatterplot enabled us to detect a series of the shortest R-R intervals for a wide range of preceding R-R intervals, and this allowed us to estimate the rate-dependent functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node in simulated atrial fibrillation.
 The estimated functional refractory periods correlated well with those measured by the conventional method (r = 0.93).
 We conclude that the proposed method makes it possible to estimate the rate-dependent functional refractory periods of the atrioventricular node in atrial fibrillation.

 Chronic supraventricular tachycardia causes a dilated cardiomyopathy in man.
 Terminating this tachycardia appears to result in symptomatic improvement; however, its effects on left ventricular (LV) volume, mass, and function have not been fully examined.
 Accordingly, hemodynamic studies using simultaneous echocardiography and catheterization were performed in three groups of pigs: 1) those subjected to rapid left atrial pacing (240 beats/min) for 3 weeks (SVT, n = 8), 2) those subjected to supraventricular tachycardia for 3 weeks followed by termination of pacing and a 4-week recovery period (PSVT, n = 9), and 3) sham-operated controls (CTR, n = 10).
 Systolic pump function was assessed using fractional shortening (FS), peak ejection rate [peak (-)dD/dt], and maximum rate of pressure development [peak (+)dP/dt].
 Diastolic function was assessed using the time constant of isovolumic pressure decline (tau), peak early diastolic filling rate [peak (+)dD/dt], the chamber stiffness constant (Kc), and the myocardial stiffness constant (Km).
 Supraventricular tachycardia caused LV dilation (end-diastolic dimension [EDD] increased from 3.5 +/- 0.4 cm in CTR to 4.9 +/- 0.5 cm in SVT, p less than 0.05) but no change in LV mass (LV weight-to-body weight ratio [LV/BW]) was 2.58 +/- 0.3 g/kg in CTR and 2.66 +/- 0.4 g/kg in SVT), all indexes of systolic function became abnormal (FS fell from 30 +/- 4% in CTR to 13 +/- 5% in SVT, p less than 0.05), and the indexes of relaxation and filling were slowed (tau increased from 36 +/- 3 msec in CTR to 51 +/- 13 msec in SVT, p less than 0.05).
 There were no significant changes in Kc or Km.
 After terminating the supraventricular tachycardia, LV volume fell but remained greater than that in CTR (EDD was 4.2 +/- 0.4 cm in PSVT, p less than 0.05 versus CTR) and substantial LV hypertrophy developed (LV/BW was 3.48 +/- 0.5 g/kg in PSVT, p less than 0.05 versus CTR).
 Systolic function returned to normal (FS was 31 +/- 5% in PSVT) but diastolic function remained abnormal.
 In PSVT, tau remained prolonged (49 +/- 12 msec, p less than 0.05 versus CTR), Kc increased from 3.7 +/- 1.0 in CTR to 7.4 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.05), and Km increased from 4.4 +/- 1.5 in CTR to 13.9 +/- 9.7 (p less than 0.05).
 Thus, the improvement in systolic function that occurs after the termination of supraventricular tachycardia is associated with the development of LV hypertrophy and persistent diastolic dysfunction.

1477,"Preoperative evaluation and surgical treatment for tricuspid regurgitation associated with acquired valvular heart disease. The Kay-Boyd method vs the Carpentier-Edwards ring method.
 This study compared the results of annuloplastic repair of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) using Doppler echocardiography.
 Sixty-three patients who underwent tricuspid annuloplasty were studied.
 Thirty-four patients received Kay-Boyd annuloplasty and 29 Carpentier-Edwards ring annuloplasty.
 A new classification of TR based on the direction and area of regurgitation flow on Doppler echocardiogram was applied preoperatively.
 In the Kay-Boyd group, 10 cases showed massive TR and 24 cases showed localized TR preoperatively.
 Localized TR was well controlled in all cases, but 8 of 9 cases of massive TR showed grade III residual TR.
 In the C-E group, 21 cases showed massive TR and 8 cases showed localized TR.
 All cases were well controlled postoperatively.
 We conclude that (1) although the Kay-Boyd method is acceptable for localized TR, the C-E method should be employed for massive TR; (2) analyzing the regurgitant pattern of TR by Doppler echocardiogram is useful in selecting an appropriate surgical technique.

 We studied the efficacy of preischemic and postischemic systemic treatment with a new calcium antagonist nilvadipine in a permanent focal cerebral ischemia model of spontaneously hypertensive rats.
 Rats that underwent microsurgical middle cerebral artery occlusion were blindly assigned to a single intraperitoneal injection of nilvadipine (0.32 mg/kg) or the same amount of polyethylene glycol either 15 minutes before, immediately after, 1 hour after, or 3 hours after occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery.
 Neurologic conditions of rats were closely examined, and rats were killed 24 hours later.

 Percutaneous nerve excitability testing using the Hilger facial nerve stimulator was introduced about 25 years ago.
 The test is reliable, easy to use, and inexpensive; it continues to be the most frequently used method for predicting prognosis of facial nerve disorders.
 Between 1966 and 1974, we recorded 10,243 nerve excitability tests on 865 patients with a mean of 3.29 tests for each peripheral branch and 3.43 for the trunk.
 Using a multiple regression model, we determined the effect on nerve stimulation values of age, sex, race, diabetes, hypertension, partial or complete clinical paralysis, diagnosis of herpes zoster, year of testing, and eventual facial paralysis recovery profile.
 We discuss statistical reliability, provide a table of interpretive results, and offer ""tips and traps"" invaluable to the practitioner.

 Expression of an estrogen-regulated protein known as the 27,000-d heat-shock or stress-response protein (srp-27) was evaluated in human breast carcinomas and established breast cancer cell lines.
 Results obtained by Northern and Western blot analyses and immunohistochemical methods were concordant.
 Immunohistochemical assessment of srp-27 expression in 300 breast carcinomas (with median patient follow-up of 8 years) was performed.
 Twenty-six percent of lymph node-negative and 45% of lymph node-positive tumors were overexpressors.
 Univariate analysis demonstrated significant correlations between srp-27 overexpression and estrogen receptor (ER) content, pS2 protein expression, nodal metastases, advanced T stage, lymphatic/vascular invasion, and a shorter disease-free survival period (but not a shorter overall survival) for the study population as a whole.
 Regression tree analysis showed that srp-27 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for disease-free survival only in patients with one to three positive lymph nodes.
 The Cox proportional hazards model confirmed the independent prognostic significance of nodal involvement, T stage, and ER content but failed to recognize srp-27 overexpression as a significant independent parameter predictive of patient outcome in the patient population as a whole.
 The observed associations between srp-27 overexpression and more aggressive tumors suggest a biologic role for srp-27 in human breast carcinomas.

 The hypothesis that endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) modulates hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) was tested in isolated, blood-perfused rat lungs ventilated with gas mixtures of 21% O2-5% CO2-74% N2 (normoxia) or of 3% O2-5% CO2-92% N2 (hypoxia); 30 microM NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), an inhibitor of EDRF production, caused a reduction in the endothelium-dependent relaxant response to acetylcholine (ACh) from 62 +/- 7, 88 +/- 4, and 100 +/- 4% to 26 +/- 8, 49 +/- 12, and 75 +/- 7% at ACh concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 microM, respectively (p less than 0.05 at all concentrations), indicating that L-NMMA acts via the inhibition of EDRF production.
 L-NMMA induced a concentration-related augmentation in HPV of 20 +/- 5, 32 +/- 8, and 34 +/- 8% at concentrations of 30, 300, and 1,000 microM (p less than 0.05, compared with a vehicle control group at all concentrations).
 The pressor response to a dose of angiotensin II (A-II), which produced the same increase in pulmonary artery pressure as that induced by hypoxia, was also significantly augmented (2 +/- 0.6%), but to a lesser extent.
 The augmentation of HPV by 30 microM L-NMMA was completely reversed by 1 mM L-arginine (a precursor of EDRF), but not by D-arginine (an isomer of L-arginine).
 One and 6 mM L-arginine, but not 6 mM D-arginine caused a significant inhibition of HPV by 20 +/- 2 and 47 +/- 12% (p less than 0.05, compared with the vehicle control group) and a small but not significant reduction in A-II-mediated contraction.

1482,"Evaluation of the serum level of immunosuppressive substance in oral cancer patients.
 The serum level of immunosuppressive substance (IS) was studied in 40 patients with primary oral cancer and in 79 patients without cancer.
 Its usefulness was evaluated as a parameter for monitoring therapy as well as recurrence of the tumors.
 Mean values for serum IS in patients with cancer and patients without were 687 +/- 284 micrograms/mL and 464 +/- 153 micrograms/mL, respectively.
 Normal healthy controls had a mean value of 431 +/- 105 micrograms/mL, with the cutoff value set at 641 micrograms/mL (mean +2 SD).
 Patients without cancer who had a severe infectious disease showed conspicuously high serum IS levels, and these values were closely correlated with their C-reactive protein values.
 The positive rate of IS increased in all patients with oral cancer was 58%.
 The mean level of serum IS in cancer patients was significantly higher than that of the controls (P less than .01), and the level was found to be more elevated as the stage of the disease advanced (stage I to III, 48%; stage IV, 68%).
 Histologic analysis of the tumor cells in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) showed that the mean serum IS level of those who had poorly differentiated SCC was much higher (937 +/- 181 micrograms/mL) than that of patients with well-differentiated SCC (616 +/- 159 micrograms/mL).
 Patients who had recurrent or metastatic cancer, or those who died from the cancer exhibited marked elevation of the serum IS levels, whereas patients who remained free of cancer in the follow-up period showed significantly lower serum IS levels.
 The rise and fall of the serum IS level was closely correlated with the disease progression and/or remission.
 These data strongly suggest that serum IS is a useful parameter for monitoring the disease stage as well as the effect of therapy on patients with oral cancer.

1483,"Accuracy of exercise electrocardiography in detecting physiologically significant coronary arterial lesions.
 The accuracy of exercise electrocardiography in detecting a physiologically significant coronary artery stenosis has been assessed previously by comparing the exercise test with a coronary arteriogram.
 The inherent inaccuracy of visually determined percent diameter stenosis measurements might have lead to the conclusion that the exercise electrocardiogram was less accurate than it truly was.
 To determine the accuracy of the exercise electrocardiography in detecting a physiologically significant coronary stenosis, we studied 40 patients with one-vessel, one-lesion coronary artery disease, a normal resting electrocardiogram, and no hypertrophy or prior infarction.
 Each patient underwent exercise electrocardiography (Bruce protocol) that was interpreted as abnormal if the ST segment developed 0.1-mV or greater depression 80 msec after the J point.
 The physiological significance of each coronary stenosis was assessed by measuring of coronary flow reserve (peak divided by resting blood flow velocity) in the stenotic artery using a Doppler catheter and intracoronary papaverine (normal, 3.5 or greater peak/resting velocity).
 The percent diameter and percent area stenosis produced by each lesion were determined using quantitative angiography (Brown/Dodge method).
 Of the 17 patients with reduced coronary flow reserve (3.5 or greater peak/resting blood flow velocity) in the stenotic artery, 14 had an abnormal exercise electrocardiogram (sensitivity, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.94).
 Conversely, 20 of 23 patients with normal coronary flow reserves had normal exercise tests (specificity, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.97).
 The exercise electrocardiogram was abnormal in each of 11 patients with markedly reduced coronary flow reserve (less than 2.5 peak/resting velocity) and in three of six patients with moderately reduced reserve (2.5-3.4 peak/resting velocity).
 The products of systolic blood pressure and heart rate at peak exercise were significantly correlated with coronary reserve in patients with truly abnormal exercise tests.
 In comparison, the sensitivity (0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.76) and specificity (0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.86) of exercise electrocardiography in detecting a 60% or greater diameter stenosis may be significantly lower (p less than 0.05).
 Exercise electrocardiography, therefore, was a good predictor of the physiological significance (assessed by coronary flow reserve) of a coronary stenosis in patients with a normal resting electrocardiogram and no hypertrophy or prior infarction.
 Its value in a broader and larger patient population will require further study.
 These results, however, underscore the importance of a physiological gold standard in assessing the accuracy of noninvasive studies for detecting coronary artery disease.

1484,"Prognostic factors for outcome of and survival after second-look laparotomy in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma.
 In ovarian cancer stages IIB-IV, pre-treatment variables and variables obtained intraoperatively at second-look laparotomy were investigated for their prognostic influence on the outcome of 109 patients and survival after second-look laparotomy in 131 patients.
 The subjects came from a randomized trial of sequential versus alternating combination chemotherapy.
 The overall median survival after second-look laparotomy was 62 months.
 Logistic regression analysis identified stage and hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy as significant prognostic covariates for second-look laparotomy outcome.
 Based on a Cox multivariate stepwise analysis, independent prognostic factors for survival after second-look laparotomy were secondary residual tumor size, pre-treatment histologic differentiation grade, and performance status.
 A high differentiation grade and a good performance status at the start of therapy thus still had a prolonging effect on survival after second-look laparotomy.
 The prognostic power of these pre-treatment variables was increased substantially by the addition of the secondary residual tumor size variable.
 The 3-year survival rate after second-look laparotomy for high- and low-risk patients was 15 and 87%, respectively.
 Second-look laparotomy thus provides prognostic information in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma, but the benefit in terms of survival is still unclear.

 A high-affinity muscarinic receptor antagonist, 123IQNB (3-quinuclidinyl-4-iodobenzilate labeled with iodine 123), was used with single photon emission computed tomography to image muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in 14 patients with dementia and in 11 healthy controls.
 High-resolution single photon emission computed tomographic scanning was performed 21 hours after the intravenous administration of approximately 5 mCi of IQNB.
 In normal subjects, the images of retained ligand showed a consistent regional pattern that correlated with postmortem studies of the relative distribution of muscarinic receptors in the normal human brain, having high radioactivity counts in the basal ganglia, occipital cortex, and insular cortex, low counts in the thalamus, and virtually no counts in the cerebellum.
 Eight of 12 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease had obvious focal cortical defects in either frontal or posterior temporal cortex.
 Both patients with a clinical diagnosis of Pick's disease had obvious frontal and anterior temporal defects.
 A region of interest statistical analysis of relative regional activity revealed a significant reduction bilaterally in the posterior temporal cortex of the patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with controls.
 This study demonstrates the practicability of acetylcholine receptor imaging with 123IQNB and single photon emission computed tomography.

 OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study was to assess the relation of lesion location to mood and vegetative disturbance following stroke.
 METHOD: Fifty-two inpatients and outpatients who had had single, unilateral strokes were included.
 Patients with past CNS or psychiatric disorders were excluded.
 A modified Visual Analogue Dysphoria Scale was used to allow the inclusion of all but the most impaired aphasic patients.
 Sleep and eating disturbances were measured by using both self-report and nursing assessments.
 Location of lesions was determined by CT scan and classified according to three dimensions: right-left, dorsal-ventral, and frontal-nonfrontal.
 RESULTS: On measures of dysphoric mood and sleep disturbance, results indicated significant three-way interactions among the three lesion dimensions.
 No differences were found with regard to eating disturbance.
 Greater dysphoria and sleep disturbance were found in subjects with left parietal/occipital, left inferior frontal, right superior frontal, and right temporal lesions than in subjects with lesions in other locations.
 Depressive symptoms were not associated with functional impairment as measured by activities of daily living, motor strength, or severity of aphasia.
 CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that lesion location is a valid and significant factor in the mixture of influences which may result in a dysphoric mood state following stroke.
 The relation between the site of the lesion and subsequent depressive symptoms, however, may be more complex than has been reported previously.

 The effects of flosequinan on ventricular performance and myocardial contractility were studied in 10 patients with severe congestive heart failure during right and left cardiac catheterization.
 Sixty minutes after a 100 mg oral dose of flosequinan, the peak rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) increased from 940 +/- 180 to 1050 +/- 240 mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.05), while left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 32 +/- 5 to 26 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), and cardiac index increased (2.1 +/- 0.4 to 2.3 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2, (p less than 0.05).
 The mean pulmonary artery pressure and vascular resistance decreased from 40 +/- 8 to 33 +/- 12 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and from 330 +/- 240 to 290 +/- 170 dyne-sec/cm5 (p less than 0.05), respectively.
 Heart rate, mean aortic pressure, right atrial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and serum norepinephrine levels did not change significantly.
 The increase in left ventricular peak dP/dt that was concomitant with a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and no change in systemic arterial pressure or sympathetic tone, argue for a direct positive inotropic effect of flosequinan.

 Due to the risk of posttraumatic epilepsy, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid are often prescribed for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
 In this review the literature is examined for evidence of neurobehavioral impairment due to carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproic acid.
 No comparative studies have been performed in the TBI population, making if difficult to determine if one of these medications is preferable.
 Direct inference from studies on epilepsy patients to TBI patients is hazardous due to underlying differences in the two populations.
 Reported findings for epilepsy patients are subtle and not consistent across studies.
 All three drugs appear to exert some effect on cognitive and motor functions in epileptic patients, and these impairments worsen at increasing serum levels.
 The varied length of experience with each drug makes it difficult to assign relative weight to the evidence for or against each.

1490,"Implications of echocardiographically assisted diagnosis of pericardial tamponade in contemporary medical patients: detection before hemodynamic embarrassment.
 Identification of suspected pericardial tamponade and the decision to perform invasive drainage of the pericardial space have historically been based on classic bedside findings.
 Two-dimensional echocardiography has improved detection of pericardial effusion, but it may be excessively sensitive in evaluation of patients for hemodynamic embarrassment.
 Therefore, 50 consecutive medical patients were examined who were identified by echocardiography to have probable tamponade (defined as the presence of right heart chamber collapse in the presence of a pericardial effusion) and who underwent combined right-sided cardiac catheterization and percutaneous pericardiocentesis.
 All patients had elevated pericardial pressure.
 However, many had minimal evidence of hemodynamic compromise (94% had systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg and 58% had a cardiac index greater than or equal to 2.3 liters/min per m2).
 Pericardiocentesis resulted in hemodynamic improvement, but frequently did not alleviate dyspnea or correct tachycardia.
 Patients with malignancy as the cause of tamponade had a high mortality rate (the cumulative probability of survival in such patients was only 17% at 1 year).
 Echocardiographically assisted diagnosis of pericardial tamponade in medical patients results in the identification of a substantial subset of patients with only subtle evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
 This subset of patients differs sharply from medical patients described in previous reports with classic tamponade.
 Although the patients can be managed by invasive catheter pericardiocentesis with few complications, the natural history and the optimal management strategy for this group are not resolved.

 The ability to share time and to shift attention between bimanual simultaneous motor tasks were studied in 18 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 19 age- and intelligence-matched controls.
 The task consisted of drawing triangles with the dominant hand and squeezing a rubber bulb with the nondominant hand.
 Motor performance was measured using the variables: amplitude of squeezing, frequency of squeezing and velocity of drawing triangles.
 After eliminating variance due to baseline differences in single-handed performance, the bimanual simultaneous performance of PD and controls turned out to be similar to the frequency of squeezing and the velocity of drawing triangles.
 The amplitude of squeezing, however, differed between the two groups: it was significantly reduced in PD.
 Arguably the disturbance in the bimanual performance of PD patients was not due to a disorder of time sharing, but to a decreased ability to shift attention from the visually cued task to the non visually cued task.
 The results agree with current evidence that PD patients are more impaired when they have to rely upon internal control for the regulation of shifting attention than when external cues are available.

 The frequency of IGF-I in adrenocortical carcinomas was significantly higher than that in adenomas of the adrenal glands.

 Median nerve somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) grades and Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC) scores were obtained from 51 patients with head injuries within 1 week after the injury to determine the relationship of these scores, both individually and combined, to outcome scores obtained more than 6 months after the injury.
 SSEP grading was based on the presence or absence of the cortical evoked potential, the amplitude of the early cortically generated P22 wave form, and the conduction time through the brain (P/N13-N20 interpeak latency).
 SSEP responses from both sides of the brain were combined and graded from 1 to 6.
 The GCS was graded without the verbal component (maximum score, 10), because all patients were intubated.
 All patients were unresponsive to commands.
 Median SSEP grades correlated better with Glasgow Outcome Scale and Barthel Index scores (R = 0.57 and 0.64, respectively; P less than 0.00001) than GCS scores did (R = 0.35 and 0.37, respectively, P less than 0.00001), and combining SSEP grades and GCS scores did not improve the predictive power of the model (R = 0.57 and 0.64, respectively; P less than 0.00001).

 Inhibition of collagen synthesis by IFN-gamma is associated with a coordinate inhibition of transcription for types I and III collagen.
 In addition, IFN-gamma suppresses levels of procollagen mRNA and type II collagen synthesis in human articular chondrocytes.
 In vivo studies in mice have demonstrated that IFN-gamma inhibits the collagen synthesis associated with the fibrotic response to an implanted foreign body, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and the healing response to cutaneous thermal burns.
 In the latter case, while collagen content of the wound scar was decreased, hyaluronic acid was increased in mice receiving IFN-gamma compared to controls.
 This is in accord with in vitro studies showing that, while interferons alpha and beta decrease production of glycosaminoglycans, IFN-gamma increases production of glycosaminoglycans.
 Of interest, acute inflammation at sites of thermal injury, or when elicited by proinflammatory agents in separate experiments, also was suppressed in mice treated with IFN-gamma.
 The means by which IFN-gamma inhibits collagen synthesis involves transcriptional regulation.
 There is a single report that interferon alpha can decrease the size of a keloid of recent onset in a human patient.
 Because the interferons can inhibit collagen synthesis in vivo, further studies may be warranted to evaluate the usefulness of these agents in the treatment of disease states characterized by abnormal fibrotic responses as well as their potential for altering the healing response associated with particular therapeutic interventions.

1503,"In vitro drug sensitivity of cells from children with leukemia using the MTT assay with improved culture conditions.
 The knowledge about drug resistance in childhood leukemias and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in general is limited.
 This is because of the lack of a suitable in vitro drug sensitivity assay, which is in part due to low in vitro ALL cell survival.
 We recently adapted the highly efficient 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to test cells from ALL patients and showed that its results were comparable with those of the DiSC assay, up to now the most valid but laborious assay.
 In this study, in vitro drug sensitivity was assessed in cells from 82 children with leukemia, 79 of whom had ALL, with the MTT assay.
 Dose response curves were obtained for 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine (6-TG), prednisolone (Pred), daunorubicin (DNR), vincristine (VCR), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), L-asparaginase (L-Asp), mafosfamide, and mustine.
 A cytotoxic effect of methotrexate could be detected in only a few cases.
 Large interindividual differences in drug sensitivity were detected.
 Compared with leukemia cells from newly diagnosed patients, leukemia cells from relapsed patients were significantly more in vitro resistant to 6-TG, Pred, Ara-C, mafosfamide and mustine but not to DNR, VCR, and L-Asp.
 Improvements of culture medium and methods to increase MTT reduction were studied.
 From 10 components tested, addition of insulin and bovine serum albumin to serum-containing medium improved ALL cell survival.
 Addition of succinate did not increase the amount of MTT reduction.
 We conclude that the in vitro MTT assay highly facilitates large-scale studies on drug resistance of ALL patients that can lead to rational improvements in existing treatment protocols.

1504,"Upward shift of the lower range of coronary flow autoregulation in hypertensive patients with hypertrophy of the left ventricle 
 BACKGROUND.
 At any given perfusion pressure, coronary reserve is expressed by the difference between autoregulated and maximally vasodilated flow.
 In hypertension the raised coronary resistance reduces the steepness of the pressure-flow relationship at maximal vasodilatation.
 In the presence of cardiac hypertrophy the line of autoregulated flow becomes higher.
 For these reasons coronary reserve is reduced and the point at which baseline flow approaches the maximal achievable flow might be shifted to a higher perfusion pressure.
 Thus, any reduction below this elevated and critical value of pressure would lower the coronary flow.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 The investigated patients were normotensive (controls, nine) and hypertensive with normal (group I, seven) or augmented LV mass index because of concentric LV hypertrophy (group II, eight).
 All had effort-induced angina and angiographically normal left epicardial branches.
 Flow in the great cardiac vein was measured by thermodilution in the baseline and during stepwise (5 mm Hg every 5 minutes) decrease of the coronary perfusion pressure with a titrated nitroprusside i.v.
 infusion; perfusion pressures of 60 mm Hg in the controls and 70 mm Hg in the hypertensives were taken as end points.
 Baseline flow averaged 102 ml/min in normotensives, 104 ml/min in hypertensive group I and 148 ml/min in hypertensive group II.
 At the end points flow was similar to baseline in the controls and group I.
 In group II coronary flow started to decline and myocardial O2 extraction started to slightly but significantly rise at perfusion pressures of 90-80 mm Hg; at the end point flow was reduced by 26% (p less than 0.01 from baseline).
 The perfusion patterns did not seem to be related to the changes in tension-time index and heart rate.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The association of high blood pressure (reduced ability of the coronary arterioles to dilate) and hypertrophy of the myocardium (augmented baseline coronary flow) may shift the point of exhaustion of coronary reserve to a higher perfusion pressure and make the myocardium vulnerable to treatment-induced relative hypertension.

1505,"Radioimmunology. Imaging and therapy.
 Targeting of radioactivity to tumors using antitumor antibodies is evolving from a laboratory curiosity toward a practical diagnostic and therapeutic technique that promises widespread benefits for many common human cancers.
 The development of the hybridoma technique by Kohler and Milstein for producing monoclonal antibodies is probably the single most important contribution to the development of this field.
 A large array of monoclonal antibodies against many human tumors have been created and labeled with a variety of radioisotopes; 110 clinical trials have been identified from the literature between the interval of 1978 to the present.
 These studies are beginning to form the basis for certain conclusions regarding likely benefits for certain combinations of antitumor antibodies and isotopes in specific instances of clinical management in patients with malignant neoplasms.
 For example, in melanoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and colorectal malignancies, radiolabeled antibodies have demonstrated occult tumors, which could not be disclosed with conventional methodologies.
 Radioimmunotherapy of malignant lymphoma is achieving durable remissions in patients who have failed conventional forms of therapy.
 For the most part, these advances have been achieved through intelligent application of known principles of immunochemistry, imaging physics, and tumor immunology.
 Progress has been slow but steady.
 In a few instances, the term ""magic bullet"" is warranted in describing the targeting of a particular radiolabeled antibody to a human tumor.
 I-131, 3-F8, an IgG3 against the GD2 antigen of neuroblastoma, which was introduced by Cheung, and In-111 T-101, against the CD5 antigen of T-cells, which was developed by Royston, stand out because of the consistency and high concentration of radioactive targeting to human tumors in clinical trials.
 If certain technical innovations fulfill their initial promise, the future will be bright for radioimmunologic methods of diagnosis and therapy.
 Genetic engineering will permit the development of ""humanized"" antibodies with biologic properties that favor tumor localization.
 New chemical approaches will broaden the range of isotopes available as diagnostic and therapeutic radiolabels.
 Application of modern imaging methodologies, such as positron emission tomography (PET), will detect more lesions of smaller size and permit quantitative imaging for dosimetry considerations.
 Greater speed and ease of use of computerized work stations will lead to the broader application of fusion imaging in which radioantibody images will be viewed simultaneously with TCT or MRI for better anatomic correlation of abnormal sites of antigen-reactive tumor deposits.

 In this report, three new cases of trilateral retinoblastoma are presented.
 The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of the patients are described and compared with those of 32 cases that have been previously reported in the literature.
 A positive family history was obtained in 68% of the patients.
 The mean age at diagnosis of bilateral retinoblastoma was 7.2 months.
 The mean age at diagnosis of trilateral disease was 39.7 months, resulting in a mean latent interval of 32.6 months.

 To compare the hemodynamic results of different anuloplasty techniques of primary valve repair for mitral regurgitation, 122 patients were prospectively studied with Doppler echocardiograms 5 to 10 days after operation.
 Seventy-seven patients had mitral valve prolapse, 27 had coronary artery disease, 13 patients had rheumatic mitral valve lesions and 5 patients had infective endocarditis.
 Forty-eight patients received the flexible Duran ring, 46 received the more rigid Carpentier ring and 28 patients received no ring.
 Doppler echocardiography demonstrated a significant decrease in mitral valve area estimated by the pressure half-time method in patients who received either a Carpentier (2.6 +/- 0.8 cm2) or Duran ring (2.8 +/- 0.8 cm2) when compared with patients who received no ring (3.2 +/- 0.7 cm2) (p = 0.01).
 No significant differences were observed for peak transmitral diastolic velocity, peak transmitral diastolic gradient, or the grade of mitral regurgitation by color flow Doppler mapping between patients with and without rings.
 The etiology of mitral disease and concomitant surgical procedures accompanying mitral valve repair did not significantly influence mitral valve area, peak velocity or peak gradient.
 These data suggest that Carpentier and Duran rings decrease the hemodynamic mitral valve area; however, the decrease in valve area is small and not associated with a clinically important increase in transvalvular gradient.

1509,"Biomechanics of fracture risk prediction of the hip and spine by quantitative computed tomography.
 In this review, we have made use of some simple engineering concepts to summarize current efforts relating QCT measures to bone density and strength.
 From a variety of in vitro experiments on cadaveric vertebrae and femora, it is evident that both apparent and ash densities are strong linear functions of QCT measures, with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.49 to 0.90 and relative errors from 44.9% to 7.1%.
 QCT data also can be used (with somewhat less confidence) to determine the compressive modulus (R2s from 0.36 to 0.68, relative errors from 45.0% to 35.5%) and compressive strength (R2s from 0.58 to 0.70, relative errors from 56.5% to 39.9%) of trabecular bone from the proximal femur and vertebral body.
 In cortical bone, material properties are only correlated weakly with QCT measures.
 Experiments designed to relate QCT data to failure loads for the proximal femur and vertebral body have been remarkably successful.
 Coefficients of determination have ranged from 0.32 to 0.93, with relative errors from 31.1% to 13.9%.
 However, when the in vitro failure loads determined in these experiments are compared against available estimates of in vivo loads on the spine and hip, it is apparent, at least in the elderly, that in vivo loads are relatively close to those that cause fracture in vitro.
 To assess the possibility of developing QCT-based clinical predictors of fracture risk for individual patients, we have introduced the concept factor of risk often used in engineering design to account for uncertainties in estimates of service loads and component strength.
 The factor of risk for a particular loading condition is defined as the ratio of expected service loads to the known failure loads.
 To extend this concept to densitometric fracture risk prediction in vivo, it is important to recognize that densitometric data must not only be used to predict the ultimate load carrying capacity of the region of interest, but that this ultimate load must then be compared to the forces expected in vivo under comparable loading conditions.
 One difficulty with this approach is that little is known about the in vivo forces that are associated with atraumatic age-related fractures of the hip and vertebrae and even less about the forces applied to the hip and spine during traumatic events such as falls.
 However, from available estimates of in vivo loads during bending and lifting, it is apparent that in the elderly, factors of risk for the spine can easily approach 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

 The use of carcinoembryonic antigen was evaluated in 425 patients with a mean follow-up of 48 months.
 The preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels were predictive of recurrence and survival independent of the tumor stage.
 In a multivariate regression analysis of age, location, tumor stage, and preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, the latter three factors were significant prognostic variables with respect to the adjusted survival.
 Recurrent disease was found in 42% of patients, excluding patients with stage IV disease.
 The carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was greater than 5 ng/mL in 79% of the patients and in 89% of the intra-abdominal recurrences.
 Carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was not predictive of postrecurrence survival except in the subgroup of locoregional disease.
 The life span in patients with liver and lung metastases was not influenced by carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence.
 Preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels can indicate a poorer prognostic group of patients with colorectal cancer who may benefit from adjuvant treatment.
 The carcinoembryonic antigen at recurrence can be used effectively to diagnose intra-abdominal recurrences and project survival after development of local/regional disease.

 After 14 weeks of treatment with doxazosin, a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in systolic blood pressure and DBP was observed.
 Mean blood pressures were reduced from 170/100 mm Hg at baseline to 161/93 mm Hg at the end of treatment.
 Minor changes in heart rate occurred, which with continued treatment were not statistically significant from baseline.

 To determine the subjective perception patients have of abnormal movements, 170 patients with various hyperkinesias were interviewed with questions directed at the ""voluntary"" or intentional versus ""involuntary"" aspects of their symptoms.
 One hundred and two of 110 patients with non-tic disorders thought that the abnormal movements were entirely involuntary.
 Forty-one of 60 tic disorder patients stated that all their motor and phonic tics were intentionally produced.
 Fifteen others had both voluntary and involuntary components, usually with the former predominating.
 A ""voluntary"" response could be used to predict the correct diagnostic category (tic versus non-tic) in 8 of 9 patients for whom the referral category was incorrect.
 These results suggest that a large proportion of the motor and phonic symptoms experienced by tic patients are irresistibly but purposefully executed, more akin to compulsions than to the other ""involuntary"" hyperkinesias with which they are commonly discussed.

 The present study was designed to examine the kinetics of Na(+)-H+ exchange in red blood cells of normotensive and hypertensive subjects and its relation to the previously reported abnormalities in Na(+)-Li+ exchange.
 The Na(+)-H+ antiporter activation kinetics were studied by varying cell pH and measuring net Na+ influx (mmol/l cell x hr = units) driven by an outward H+ gradient.
 The Na(+)-Li+ exchange was determined at pH 7.4 as sodium-stimulated Li+ efflux.
 Untreated hypertensive patients (n = 30) had a higher maximal rate of Na(+)-Li+ exchange (0.43 +/- 0.05 versus 0.26 +/- 0.02 units, p less than 0.0003), a higher maximal rate of Na(+)-H+ exchange (62.3 +/- 6.2 versus 47 +/- 4 units; p less than 0.02), but a similar affinity for cell pH compared with normotensive subjects (n = 46).
 The cell pH activation of the Na(+)-H+ antiporter exhibited a lower Hill coefficient than that of normotensive subjects (1.61 +/- 0.12 versus 2.56 +/- 0.14; p less than 0.0001).

 Olfactory discrimination and detection was studied in 106 patients with unilateral cerebral excision in the right or left temporal lobe, right or left frontal lobe, left parietal lobe, or right frontal and temporal lobes, and in 20 normal control subjects.
 Detection thresholds for n-butyl alcohol, measured separately in each nostril, did not differ across subject groups or across nostrils, thus excluding any primary sensory loss.
 The discrimination task involved monorhinal presentation of repairs of unfamiliar odorants, which the subjects judged as same or different in quality.
 The results showed a significant deficit in discrimination confined to the nostril ipsilateral to the lesion in patients with temporal lobe removals.
 Patients with frontal lobe excisions were also impaired and, for patients with right frontal lesions including the orbital cortex, the impairment was found in both nostrils.
 Patients with left parietal lesions did not demonstrate any significant deficits.
 Normal subjects showed consistently better performance in the right than in the left nostril.
 The results are interpreted as reflecting the importance of the orbitofrontal cortex in olfactory discrimination.
 Temporal lobe lesions may disrupt the input to the orbitofrontal cortex, thereby producing poorer performance.
 The nostril difference in the normal subjects, together with the birhinal impairment in patients with right orbitofrontal damage, suggest a relative advantage of the right orbital region in olfactory processing.

 Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is thought to play a role in modulating vascular cell function in vivo.
 In vitro, it decreases endothelial cell proliferation and migration.
 We postulated that these biologic activities could be mediated through TGF-beta 1 modulation of specific gene expression.
 Therefore we differentially screened a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library with cDNAs prepared from both untreated and TGF-beta 1-treated bovine aortic endothelial cells.
 Using this technique, we isolated many TGF-beta 1-induced cDNA clones.
 Sequence analysis of these cDNAs showed that many of them corresponded to alternatively spliced fibronectin mRNAs.
 These fibronectin clones all contained the extradomain I (ED I) but three different forms of the type III connecting segment (IIICS).
 These different fibronectin cDNAs were expressed in bacteria and the recombinant proteins used to study the effects of IIICS alternative splicing on cell attachment, spreading, and migration in bovine aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells and B16F10 melanoma cells.
 The results of these experiments show that attachment and spreading of bovine aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells depend primarily on the presence of the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) sequence in the recombinant fibronectin proteins.
 However attachment and spreading of bovine aortic endothelial cells are modulated by alternative splicing in the IIICS region.
 Specifically splicing of the IIICS region decreases spreading and increases migration rates of the endothelial cells.
 On the contrary, using a cell line (B16F10 melanoma cells) that is known not to require the RGDS sequence for adhesion confirmed previous findings that B16F10 melanoma cells do not require the presence of the RGDS sequence for attachment and spreading.
 Indeed B16F10 cells were able to attach and spread on two recombinant proteins that did not contain the RGDS sequence.
 However attachment and spreading of B16F10 were dramatically inhibited when a 75-base pair DNA fragment was removed from the 5' end of the IIICS region.
 These results suggest that various regions of the fibronectin molecule may be able to interact with different cell populations to promote cell attachment and spreading, and that alternative splicing may modulate this process.

1524,"Risk stratification in survivors of acute myocardial infarction: routine cardiac catheterization and angiography is a reasonable approach in most patients [editorial]
 Noninvasive risk assessment in survivors of AMI can effectively subdivide patients into groups with differing risk profiles after hospital discharge, but some patients at risk for late death or recurrent AMI may be incorrectly identified; data from cardiac catheterization and angiography provide complementary and generally more powerful prognostic information.
 Many patients may derive particular benefit from early cardiac catheterization and angiography, including: (1) patients with AMI complicated by recurrent myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, and/or complex ventricular arrhythmias; (2) patients with abnormal or inconclusive results of noninvasive testing or those patients unable to perform an exercise test; (3) patients with abnormal left ventricular global systolic function and those with increased left ventricular end-systolic volume; (4) ""young"" patients (younger than 50 years of age?); (5) older patients (older than 65 to 70 years of age?); (6) patients with non-Q wave AMI; and (7) patients who are receiving thrombolytic therapy.
 Performance of early cardiac catheterization and angiography in virtually all survivors of AMI, with selective use of appropriate noninvasive tests, may provide a more efficacious means of risk assessment after AMI; if all tests are performed judiciously, the cost of such an approach need not be excessive.
 A combination of invasive and selected noninvasive tests probably provides optimal information.
 The risks to the routine performance of diagnostic cardiac catheterization and angiography in all survivors of AMI are: (1) adequate care and attention may not be paid to proper performance of the procedure(s) and to detailed and proper analyses of the data; (2) the need for additional noninvasive testing in selected patients may be ignored; and most importantly, (3) premature or unnecessary revascularization procedures may be performed subsequently.
 For optimal patient care, the clinician must obtain all necessary data, avoid unnecessary and repetitive tests, know the accuracy of individual tests at his or her own facility, interpret all data in proper context, and then counsel patients objectively about available management strategies.
 With this approach, all patients who might appropriately benefit from coronary artery revascularization will be correctly identified, and patients who are truly at very low risk (minimal residual coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function particularly if associated with a patent infarct-related artery) may be similarly identified and managed appropriately with elimination of unnecessary additional testing and pharmacologic therapy.
 Finally, whatever approach to risk stratification one chooses for an individual patient, the importance of and the need to correct and/or ameliorate risk factors for coronary artery disease must be recognized and undertaken.

 The molecular pathways that are responsible for delivering the proliferative signals from the cell surface to the nucleus in T lymphocytes are still unresolved, but recent data implicates protein kinase C (PKC) involvement in the TCR signaling pathway.
 To further address the role of PKC in T cell activation, the effects of high level expression of the PKC-gamma isoenzyme in murine CTL clones were examined.
 Unlike the parental cells that required periodic Ag stimulation for cell activation and growth, cells expressing a retrovirally transduced PKC-gamma gene propagated in culture independent of the need for Ag stimulation, although maintaining identical functional specificity to the parental CTL.

 Unifocal and intrahepatic tumors were associated with better prognosis compared to the multifocal tumors and tumors with extrahepatic spread (p = 0.04 and 0.13).
 Microscopically vascular invasion and the predominance of embryonal and/or anaplastic epithelium were associated with a poor prognosis compared to the tumors with no vascular invasion and with predominantly fetal epithelium (p = 0.08 and 0.1).
 It is concluded that continued efforts to treat unresectable hepatoblastomas by liver transplantation is justified and the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in improving the results needs to be better defined.

1527,"Diagnosis of corticotropin-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors causing Cushing's syndrome 
 Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (corticotropin) has been recognized for many years.
 Traditionally, clinicians have thought that most cases were due to lung carcinomas and that the clinical manifestations differed from those for pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome.
 We report two cases of corticotropin-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors that were clinically and biochemically indistinguishable from pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome.
 Review of the literature revealed that bronchial carcinoid tumors are the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic secretion of corticotropin.
 On biochemical and anatomic studies, they are frequently indistinguishable from pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome and thus may be difficult to diagnose.
 Inferior petrosal sinus sampling for corticotropin and computerized imaging of the chest may be the best aids in making the diagnosis.

1529,"Levels of mRNA for a putative kainate receptor are affected by seizures.
 In situ hybridization and RNA blot-hybridization techniques were used (i) to examine the regional distribution of mRNA for a putative kainate receptor in adult rat brain and ii) to test the possibility that seizures affect expression of the receptor gene.
 The highest densities of hybridization were distributed within hippocampal pyramidal and granule cells, medial habenula, Purkinje cells and the molecular layer of cerebellum, and olfactory bulb.
 Recurrent limbic seizures caused a massive, delayed, and reversible reduction in levels of the kainate receptor mRNA in dentate gyrus; lesser decreases were found in pyramidal cell fields of hippocampus and superficial cortex.
 These findings provide evidence that unusual patterns of physiological activity can alter genomic expression for a subclass of glutamate receptors in brain.

1530,"Prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 mediate reduction of increased mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass by aspiration of shed pulmonary venous blood.
 Increased mean arterial pressure during the aortic crossclamp period while on cardiopulmonary bypass was usually treated by us with hypotensive drugs.
 We noticed, however, that aspirating shed excess pulmonary venous blood from the open pleural cavities causes an immediate reduction in mean arterial pressure, obviating the need for any further pharmaceutical intervention.
 In this study we investigated the relationship between the reduction in mean arterial pressure and the levels of prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 in the peripheral and pulmonary venous blood.
 Ten men undergoing coronary bypass operations had 21 episodes of increased mean arterial pressure (106.9 +/- 11.4 mm Hg) during aortic crossclamping, which was reduced to 67.4 +/- 11.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) only by aspirating a mean of 490 ml (range 150 to 1100 ml) of pulmonary venous blood from the pleurae back into the circulation.
 Mean peripheral prostacyclin level, measured as 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and prostaglandin E2 level, both measured by radioimmunoassay technique, were significantly lower at peak mean arterial pressure (419 +/- 180 and 59.5 +/- 21.2 pg/ml) than at lowest mean arterial pressure (632 +/- 271 and 96.7 +/- 52.4 pg/ml for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E2, respectively; p less than 0.001).
 Prostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E2 levels in the aspirated pulmonary venous blood were 2309 +/- 3098 pg/ml and 749 +/- 909 pg/ml, respectively.
 The hypotensive effect of shed pulmonary venous blood that is aspirated back from the pleurae into the circulation seems to be mediated by the high levels of prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2, both powerful vasodilators.

 The pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is the most commonly employed muscle skin transfer used in soft-tissue reconstruction of defects of the upper neck and jaw region.
 This article presents conceptual and technical changes in the development of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap that preserve a greater vascular pedicle and enhance the flap's arc of rotation.
 Data from 54 consecutive cases using this modified approach show a reduction in complications, a greater range of use, and consistent healing in radiated and nonradiated tissues without requiring sectioning or removing the clavicle or causing significant chest deformities.
 These modifications have produced a more predictable transfer compared with other reported techniques.

 The etiology of the 27 fistulas studied are as follows: cryptoglandular infection in 18, IBD in 7 (Crohn's 6, CUC 1), iatrogenic in 1, and foreign body perforation in 1.
 Twenty-six fistulograms revealed either direct communication with the anus or rectum, or abscess cavities/tracts, or both.
 Two fistulograms revealed no radiographic evidence of fistula (one patient had two fistulograms).
 In 13 of the 27 patients (48 percent) information obtained from the fistulograms revealed either unexpected pathology (n = 7) or directly altered surgical management (n = 6).
 We conclude that anal fistulography in properly selected patients may add useful information for the definitive management of fistula-in-ano.

 Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the breast is a very useful technique for the evaluation of a suspect lesion before surgical removal.
 Increased expression of the 67-kd laminin receptor has been associated with the metastatic phenotype of cancer cells, particularly in colon and breast cancers.
 In this study, the expression of laminin receptor was evaluated using the immunoperoxidase technique in 81 breast aspirates (26 benign and 55 neoplastic lesions).
 Cells obtained from benign samples exhibited a low level of laminin receptor antigen detected by affinity-purified antibody raised against a cDNA-derived laminin receptor peptide.
 In contrast, 71% of smears obtained from malignant breast lesions contained cells that were strongly stained by the antibody.
 Heterogeneous expression of the laminin receptor was noted in both breast aspirates and fixed tissue specimens.
 These data suggest that the immunodetection of laminin receptor in cells obtained by fine-needle aspiration of breast lesions could be a valuable adjunct in the prognostic evaluation of breast lesions.

 Symptomatic patients with a low cardiac output and low aortic valve gradient have a poor prognosis but are at high risk for aortic valve surgery.
 The outcome of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty in this subgroup of patients is unclear.
 Therefore, 67 patients (group 1) underwent percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty between December 1, 1986 and November 1, 1987 who had a low cardiac index (less than 2.5 liters/min per m2) and a low aortic valve gradient (less than or equal to 40 mm Hg) before the procedure.
 The results were compared with 200 patients (group 2) who had a low cardiac index but not a low aortic valve gradient (greater than 40 mm Hg) before the procedure and who had similar baseline presenting symptoms.
 After balloon aortic valvuloplasty, there was a greater decrease in aortic valve gradient in patients in group 2 than in patients in group 1 (mean +/- SD -33.0 +/- 16.7 mm Hg and -14.6 +/- 6.9 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.001) although there was no significant difference in improvement in estimated aortic valve area (0.31 +/- 0.21 and 0.31 +/- 0.22 cm2, respectively; p = NS).
 In-hospital mortality was 11.9% for patients in group 1 which was not significantly different from the 7.5% mortality for patients in group 2.
 However, the actuarial probability of survival at 12 months for patients who survived the initial hospitalization was 46% in group 1 and 64% in group 2 (p less than 0.05).

 The authors discuss the indications for hydroxypolyethoxydodecan in the sclerosing treatment of angiomas, with particular reference to cavernous, venous, and evolutive angiomas (ie, immature angiomas that fail to involute by eight to ten months).
 Moreover, the sclerosing agent may be employed, in connection with embolization and subsequent surgery, in arteriovenous angiomas with a relevant cutaneous-subcutaneous development.
 The authors have successfully used the ""interstitial"" sclerosing technique, according to Andrews' method.
 This technique involves interstitial injections to obtain the sclerosis of the thin threads of fibrous tissue stroma between the blood vessels.
 The sclerosing therapy may cause the complete regression of ""low flow"" angiomas or, at least, a partial reduction that simplifies the ensuing surgical excision.
 In the case of partial regression of the angioma obtained with the sclerosing therapy, the surgery of the remaining angioma causes a lesser degree of bleeding (especially in areas that do not particularly lend themselves to surgical exploration, ie, the oral cavity); an increased reliability in the radicality of the intervention (due also to the reduced size of the lesion); and better results from an aesthetic-functional point of view.

 Although hemorrhage severely depresses macrophage functions, it is not known whether the increased TNF-alpha or PGE2 production is responsible for it.
 To study this C3H/HeN mice were bled to mean blood pressure of 35 mmHg for 60 minutes, resuscitated, and treated with either ibuprofen (1.0 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline).
 Hemorrhage increased plasma prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels by 151.7% +/- 40.0% (p less than 0.05) and significantly decreased peritoneal macrophage (pM phi) antigen presentation (AP) by 60.5% +/- 7.3%, Ia expression by 52.3% +/- 7.6%, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) synthesis by 60.5% +/- 12.3% compared to shams.
 However ibuprofen treatment reduced PGE2 plasma levels by 61.3% +/- 12.1% and significantly increased AP (+237.0% +/- 95.3%), Ia expression (+72.8% +/- 27.5%), IL-1 synthesis (+235.7% +/- 134.7%), and cachectin synthesis (+485.8% +/- 209.0%) compared to vehicle-treated animals.
 These results indicate that prostaglandins but not cachectin are involved in the suppression of pM phi functions following hemorrhage because blockade of prostaglandin synthesis improved depressed macrophage functions despite enhanced cachectin synthesis.

 Adults resuscitated from nontraumatic cardiac arrest who received intravenous epinephrine in doses chosen by the treating physician and who survived at least 6 hours were studied to determine if high-dose epinephrine produced more complications than standard-dose.
 A total of 68 patients were enrolled and evaluated for postresuscitation complications attributable to epinephrine, using a two-tailed t test, and contingency analysis.
 The 33 patients receiving high-dose epinephrine and 35 patients receiving standard-dose epinephrine were similar in demographics and variables known to affect outcome.

 Blood-pool radionuclide angiography was used to investigate the left ventricular function in eight patients who received a Novacor assist device as a bridge-to-cardiac transplantation.
 Studies were performed during maximal and minimal tolerated assist device flows.
 The left ventricular ejection fraction, volumes, cardiac output, and the pump ejection fraction were computer-assessed.
 All patients had severe left ventricular dilation and hypokinesis before insertion of the assist device, with a mean ejection fraction of 18% +/- 4% which improved to 44% +/- 18% (p less than 0.01) during maximal assist device flows, but fell to 25% +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) during minimal flows.
 The ventricular volumes became normal at maximal assist device flow but increased significantly (p less than 0.05) during minimal flow.
 The pump was well visualized and had an ejection fraction of 82% +/- 7%.
 These data indicate that this assist device effectively unloads the left ventricle.
 The deterioration in ejection fraction following decrease in assist device flow is in keeping with the dependency of these patients on the device to sustain adequate hemodynamics.

1545,"Preclinical pharmacology of celiprolol: a cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist and mild vasodilator.
 Celiprolol is a new antihypertensive agent that represents a new generation of beta-blockers.
 It combines cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonism (beta 1) with a mild vasodilation via vasoselective beta-adrenergic agonism (beta 2).
 Results of animal studies show that celiprolol has beta 1-antagonist potency similar to that of propranolol and atenolol, and cardioselectivity slightly greater than that of atenolol.
 Celiprolol does not produce bronchoconstriction but has mild propranolol-resistant bronchodilatory properties in cats.
 The compound also relaxes vascular smooth muscle in a propranolol-sensitive fashion, suggesting a mechanism of beta 2-agonism.
 The beta 2-agonism results in a selective downregulation in beta 2-receptor number and response in tissue culture, as well as in peripheral tissue from celiprolol-treated volunteers.
 The decreases in beta 2-receptors are blocked by concomitant treatment with propranolol.
 Celiprolol is devoid of cardiac depressant activity and in fact has mild cardiostimulatory actions.
 The cardiostimulation is not via beta 1-stimulation, since it is not abolished by beta-blocking doses of propranolol.
 In a model of severe myocardial ischemia, celiprolol attenuates the ischemia-induced myocardial acidosis and improves the regional segment function.
 These results are suggestive of myocardial protection.
 In summary, celiprolol distinguishes itself from other beta-blockers by virtue of its cardioselectivity, vasorelaxation via beta 2-agonism, and the lack of bronchoconstriction and cardiodepression.
 These properties observed in animal studies have also been documented in clinical trials.

 Between 1975 and 1989, 108 children with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (MB/PNET) of the posterior fossa were treated at the authors' institution.
 The patients were managed uniformly, and treatment included aggressive surgical resections, postoperative staging evaluations for extent of disease, and craniospinal radiation therapy with a local boost.
 Beginning in 1983, children with MB/PNET were prospectively assigned to risk groups; those with ""standard-risk"" MB/PNET were treated with radiation therapy alone, while those in the ""poor-risk"" group received similar radiation therapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy with 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU), vincristine, and cisplatin.
 The 5-year actuarial disease-free survival rate for all patients treated between 1975 and 1982 was 68%, and 73% when patients who died within 2 weeks after operation were excluded.
 This survival rate was statistically better for patients treated after 1982 (82%) compared to those treated between 1975 and 1982 (49%) (p less than 0.004).
 There was no difference in disease-free survival rates over time for children with standard-risk factors; however, there was a significant difference in the 5-year survival rate for poor-risk patients treated prior to 1982 (35%) compared to those treated later (87%) (p less than 0.001).
 For the group as a whole, a younger age at diagnosis correlated with a poorer survival rate; however, this relationship between age and outcome was significant only for children treated before 1983 (p less than 0.001).
 These results demonstrated an encouraging survival rate for children with MB/PNET, especially those treated with aggressive surgical resection followed by both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
 The results strongly suggest that chemotherapy has a role for some, and possibly all, children with MB/PNET.

 In normal guinea pigs, lactulose (molecular weight, 342d) is mostly absorbed by the paracellular route, whereas L-rhamnose (molecular weight, 164 d) is mostly absorbed by the transcellular route.
 Gut permeability to L-rhamnose did not increase after burn injury (211 micrograms before burn vs 230, 260, 180, 238, and 221 micrograms on days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14, respectively, after burn).

 OBJECTIVE--To determine the perinatal mortality rate among normally formed, singleton babies with birth weights greater than or equal to 2500 g in Bath health district based on the intended place of delivery at the time of onset of labour or at the time of diagnosis of intrauterine death.
 DESIGN--The numbers of live births and stillbirths were collected monthly returns from the maternity units concerned.
 Deaths of infants aged less than or equal to 1 week were collected in the same returns.
 The intended place of delivery was confirmed at the monthly perinatal mortality meeting, during which maternal and fetal factors were discussed.
 SETTING--A rural health district of 400,000 population where one third of all deliveries occurred in seven isolated general practitioner maternity units, 8% in the integrated general practitioner unit, and the remainder in the consultant unit.
 SUBJECTS--All babies of women whose deliveries were booked in the district before the onset of labour or the diagnosis of intrauterine death, excluding twins, babies with lethal congenital malformations, and those less than 2500 g.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Outcome of all deliveries and parity of mothers.
 RESULTS--14,415 Deliveries were analysed.
 The perinatal mortality rate was 2.8/1000 births in the consultant unit (7950 deliveries), 4.8 in the isolated general practitioner units (5237 deliveries), and zero in the integrated general practitioner unit (1228 deliveries).
 Perinatal deaths attributable to asphyxia were more common in the isolated general practitioner units (1.5 per 1000) than the consultant unit (0.6 per 1000).
 The perinatal mortality rate among babies born to nulliparous women was 3.2/1000 births in the consultant unit and 5.7 in the isolated general practitioner units; for those born to multigravid women it was 2.4 and 4.2 respectively.
 CONCLUSIONS--The outcome of delivery was not influenced by parity.
 Both antenatal and intrapartum care were responsible for the higher perinatal mortality rate in the isolated general practitioner units.
 The integrated unit, which shared midwifery staff with the consultant unit, seemed to work well.
 Analysis by intended place of delivery at the time of onset of labour or diagnosis of intrauterine death suggested that the care given in isolated units needs to be improved, perhaps by better training of general practitioners and consultant supervision of antenatal care.

 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits and risks of postoperative treatment with levamisole plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with colon cancer.
 DESIGN: Computerized searches of MEDLINE and CANCERLIT were performed, and the reference list of each retrieved article was checked.
 Only randomized trials of therapy with levamisole alone or combined with 5-FU for colon cancer without distant metastases were included.
 The studies were then evaluated with the use of four criteria.
 RESULTS: We reviewed six randomized trials, of which three satisfied our criteria.
 Two studies demonstrated a significant improvement in the survival rate with levamisole plus 5-FU among patients with colon cancer and pathologically confirmed metastases to adjacent lymph nodes (Dukes' stage C).
 A subgroup analysis in another study demonstrated a similar benefit.
 The toxic effects of the drugs were generally mild.
 The three other studies showed no difference in survival rates between the treatment groups; however, the samples were too small to detect a clinically or statistically important difference.
 CONCLUSIONS: Because many patients with colon cancer will suffer a relapse we recommend that they be offered the opportunity to participate in clinical trials of adjuvant therapy.
 For those with stage C disease not entering a clinical trial levamisole plus 5-FU is appropriate adjuvant therapy.

 RESULTS--45% Of carers openly admitted to some form of abuse.
 Few patients admitted abuse.
 The most significant risk factor for physical abuse was alcohol consumption by the carer (p less than 0.001).
 Other significant risk factors were a poor pre-morbid relationship and previous abuse over many years.
 Abuse was often reciprocated and was associated with social dysfunction in many patients.
 Service delivery, respite care, and level of mental and physical disability were not significantly associated with abuse.
 CONCLUSION--The high level of abuse found in elderly patients in respite care was particularly associated with alcohol abuse and long term relationships of poor quality, which are difficult to change.
 Even with increased provision of services, care in the community may not be the best solution for these people.

1558,"Outcome and predictors of outcome in pediatric submersion victims receiving prehospital care in King County, Washington 
 Predictors of outcome in pediatric submersion victims treated by Seattle and King County's prehospital emergency services were studied.
 Victims less than 20 years old were identified from hospital admissions and paramedic and medical examiners' reports.
 The proportion of fatal or severe outcomes in patients were compared with various risk factors.
 Of 135 patients, 45 died and 5 had severe neurologic impairment.
 A subset of 38 victims found in cardiopulmonary arrest had a 32% survival rate, with 67% of survivors unimpaired or only mildly impaired.
 The two risk factors that occurred most commonly in victims who died or were severely impaired were submersion duration greater than 9 minutes (28 patients) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration longer than 25 minutes (20 patients).
 Both factors were ascertained in the prehospital phase of care.
 Submersion duration was associated with a steadily increasing risk of severe or fatal outcomes: 10% risk (7/67) for 0 to 5 minutes, 56% risk (5/9) for 6 to 9 minutes, 88% risk (21/25) for 10 to 25 minutes, 100% risk (4/4) for greater than 25 minutes.
 None of 20 children receiving greater than 25 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation escaped death or severe neurologic impairment.
 Our rates for saving all victims, particularly victims in cardiopulmonary arrest, are considerably higher than has been reported before the children.
 Prompt prehospital advanced cardiac life support is the most effective means of medical intervention for the pediatric submersion victim.
 Prehospital information provided the most valuable predictors of outcome.

1559,"Carbon monoxide-induced delayed amnesia, delayed neuronal death and change in acetylcholine concentration in mice.
 We investigated the interrelationship of delayed amnesia, delayed neuronal death and changes in acetylcholine concentration induced by carbon monoxide (CO)-exposure in mice.
 In the test for retention of the passive avoidance task, amnesia was observed 5 and 7 days after CO-exposure when the mice were exposed to CO 1 day after training; in the case when the mice were exposed to CO 5 and 7 days before training, amnesia was also observed in a retention test given 1 day after training.
 The number of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 subfield was lower than that of the control 3, 5 and 7 days after CO-exposure.
 But the neurodegeneration in the parietal cortex, area 1, was not observed until 7 days after CO-exposure.
 The findings indicated that the amnesia and the neuronal death were produced after a delay when the mice were exposed to CO.
 In addition, the delayed amnesia was closely related to the delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 subfield.
 Moreover, [3H]glutamate and [3H]glycine binding sites did not change after CO-exposure but, 7 days after CO-exposure, the concentration of acetylcholine and the binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in the frontal cortex and the striatum were found to have significantly changed, but those in the hippocampus did not show significant change.
 Therefore, we suggest that delayed amnesia induced by CO-exposure may result from delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 subfield and dysfunction in the acetylcholinergic neurons, in the frontal cortex, the striatum and/or the hippocampus.

 To address the consistent finding of asthenospermia in spinal cord injured men we compared the biochemical constituents of antegrade fractions of electroejaculates of 6 such patients with the manual ejaculates of 6 volunteers.
 Semen samples in each group were analyzed for 19 biochemical parameters, pH and osmolality.
 Organic components included triglycerides, glucose, fructose, uric acid, creatinine, urea, total protein, albumin and cholesterol.
 Metabolic enzymes, including glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase, were measured.
 Inorganic constituents included chloride, sodium, potassium, zinc and phosphorous.
 Although not significant, higher levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were demonstrated in most electroejaculates suggesting urinary contamination of the antegrade specimens.
 In electroejaculates significantly lower levels (p less than 0.05) of fructose, albumin, GOT and alkaline phosphatase as well as significantly higher levels (p less than 0.05) of chloride were noted.
 No significant difference in osmolality or pH was found.
 Moreover, in the electroejaculates the levels of glucose, uric acid and all inorganic constituents approached their corresponding levels in serum.
 We conclude that biochemical abnormalities of the seminal plasma may contribute to seminal dysfunction of spinal cord injured men and may result from neurological injury to the accessory sex glands or from the electroejaculation procedure itself.

1561,"Experimental pericardial effusion: relation of abnormal respiratory variation in mitral flow velocity to hemodynamics and diastolic right heart collapse 
 Pericardial effusion is associated with an abnormal increase in respiratory variation in mitral flow velocity.
 However, the relation of the changes in flow velocity to pericardial pressure, hemodynamics and two-dimensional echocardiographic findings is not established.
 Therefore, 11 sedated dogs with extensive hemodynamic instrumentation were studied with two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography during four stages of progressively larger pericardial effusion.
 During all stages of effusion, respiratory variation in peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole and left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time was increased compared with baseline (p less than 0.05).
 This increase was seen at the earliest stage of effusion (mean pericardial pressure 4.2 +/- 1.4 versus -0.8 +/- 0.9 mm Hg at baseline, p less than 0.05), and preceded the appearance of unequivocal diastolic right heart collapse in every dog.
 Maximal respiratory variation coincided with the appearance of right atrial collapse (mean pericardial pressure 7.1 +/- 2.4 mm Hg; mean inspiratory decrease in aortic pressure 9.5 +/- 2.6 mm Hg; mean aortic pressure 88.2 +/- 15.2 versus 102.2 +/- 11.2 mm Hg at baseline, p less than 0.05; and cardiac output 3.8 +/- 1.2 versus 5.5 +/- 1.3 liters/min at baseline, p less than 0.05), but did not increase at stages associated with more severe hemodynamic compromise.
 In addition, the respiratory changes in peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole were associated with simultaneous changes in the diastolic transmitral pressure gradient.
 It is concluded that in this model of acute pericardial effusion 1) increased respiratory variation in early diastolic mitral flow velocity, peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole and left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time occurs almost immediately as pericardial pressure increases and persists at all stages of increasing pericardial effusion; 2) the abnormal respiratory variation occurs before equalization of intracardiac pressures and before the onset of unequivocal right heart collapse; 3) the respiratory variation occurs as a result of changes in the diastolic transmitral pressure gradient; and 4) the magnitude of the respiratory change is not necessarily predictive of pericardial pressure or severity of hemodynamic compromise, especially at the more severe stages of pericardial effusion.

 From January 1986 to December 1988, a prospective trial of transcatheter arterial treatment was carried out for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 Two hundred seventy-five patients were included.
 Okuda's staging system was employed.
 Patients with Stage I and II HCC were treated by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with a gelatin sponge containing an anti-cancer agent (protocol 1a); a gelatin sponge and iodized oil mixed with an anti-cancer agent (protocol 1b); or iodized oil mixed with an anti-cancer agent (protocol 2).
 Patients with Stage III HCC were treated with iodized oil with anti-cancer agent (protocol 2).
 As an exception, patients with an unsuccessful superselective catheterization into the proper hepatic artery by Seldinger technique or obstruction of the main trunk of the portal vein were treated with percutaneous transcatheter arterial infusion into the common hepatic artery regardless of stage (protocol 3).
 Tumor type and extension, area of tumor involvement, portal vein involvement, method of treatment, and presence of ascites and icterus were found to be the significant factors for an initial response to therapy.
 Treatment method was the most important factor.
 Respective survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 70.9% and 55.3% for protocol 1a; 62.3% and 43.8% for protocol 1b; 37.8% and 18.3% for protocol 2; and 16.5% and 0% for protocol 3.
 Many factors proved to significantly influenced prognosis; however, tumor type had the most important prognostic significance followed by AFP value, ascites, treatment protocol, and area of tumor involvement.

1563,"Flow cytometry for clinical estimation of circulating hematopoietic progenitors for autologous transplantation in cancer patients.
 Optimum methods of harvesting circulating hematopoietic progenitors for autologous transplantation to support myeloablative cancer therapy are still uncertain, mostly because of the lack of an assay for marrow-repopulating stem cells.
 The CFU-GM assay, the commonly used indirect indicator of the quality of the graft, is poorly standardized and provides results evaluable only retrospectively.
 Based on the knowledge that hematopoietic progenitors express CD34 and CD33 differentiation antigens, we developed a dual-color direct immunofluorescence flow cytometry assay with the aim of replacing the CFU-GM assay advantageously.
 For this purpose, we applied both assays to 157 blood samples obtained daily throughout 20 different recoveries from pancytopenia induced by high-dose cyclophosphamide or etoposide cancer therapy with or without recombinant human GM colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF).
 The appearance of CD34+ cells in the circulation indicated that hematopoietic progenitors had increased to more than 500 CFU-GM/mL, a level clinically adequate for large-scale harvest by leukapheresis.
 Total CD34+ cells correlated well with CFU-GM (r = .89), and data could be fitted by a linear regression line described by the equation y = 388.3 + 64.0x, where y = CFU-GM/mL and x = CD34+ cells per microliter.
 Moreover, in a series of six patients treated with myeloablative chemoradiotherapy, early hematopoietic recovery of marrow functions was predicted more accurately by the number of transplanted CD34+/CD33+ cells than by either total nucleated cells, CFU-GM, CD34+/CD33- cells, or CD34-/CD33+ cells.
 Data presented in this article favor clinical use of the CD34/CD33 flow cytometry assay to guide harvesting of circulating hematopoietic progenitors for autologous transplantation and contribute to better understanding of the role played by circulating hematopoietic progenitor cell subsets in marrow recovery after myeloablative cancer therapy.

1564,"Approach to diagnosis of meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid evaluation.
 CSF evaluation is the single most important aspect of the laboratory diagnosis of meningitis.
 Analysis of the CSF abnormalities produced by bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal infections may greatly facilitate diagnosis and direct initial therapy.
 Basic studies of CSF that should be performed in all patients with meningitis include measurement of pressure, cell count and white cell differential; determination of glucose and protein levels; Gram's stain; and culture.
 In bacterial meningitis, Limulus lysate assay and tests to identify bacterial antigens may allow rapid diagnosis.
 Where there is strong suspicion of tuberculous or fungal meningitis, CSF should also be submitted for acid-fast stain, India ink preparation, and cryptococcal antigen; unless contraindicated by increased intracranial pressure, large volumes (up to 40-50 mL) should be obtained for culture.
 If a history of residence in the Southwest is elicited, complement-fixing antibodies to Coccidioides immitis should also be ordered.
 Newer tests based on immunologic methods or gene amplification techniques hold great promise for diagnosis of infections caused by organisms that are difficult to culture or present in small numbers.
 Despite the great value of lumbar puncture in the diagnosis of meningitis, injudicious use of the procedure may result in death from brain herniation.
 Lumbar puncture should be avoided if focal neurologic findings suggest concomitant mass lesion, as in brain abscess, and lumbar puncture should be approached with great caution if meningitis is accompanied by evidence of significant intracranial hypertension.
 Institution of antibiotic therapy for suspected meningitis should not be delayed while neuroradiologic studies are obtained to exclude abscess or while measures are instituted to reduce intracranial pressure.

 To investigate the asbestos burden in a steelplant environment, we counted asbestos bodies (ABs) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 65 steel workers who had retired during the previous 5 y.
 They had worked for at least 15 y in the same area of the plant (coke oven or blast furnace) as maintenance or production workers.
 On the basis of occupational anamnesis, 28 had occasional past professional exposure to asbestos; the remaining 37 workers denied any contact with asbestos.
 A total of 54 white-collar workers who had no occupational exposure to asbestos were included in the study as controls.
 An increased prevalence and concentration of ABs was found in the BALF of steel workers.
 Electron microscopy and EDAX analysis of AB from steel workers revealed that the core fibers were mainly amphiboles.
 More ABs were found in the BALF of maintenance workers than in production workers.
 However, the BALF from steel workers who denied any contact with asbestos revealed an increased AB burden v.
 controls.
 This demonstrates that steel workers may be subject to an occult exposure to amphiboles in the steelplant environment.

 All melanoma cell lines, however, expressed VLA-2, -3, and -6.
 VLA-1 was synthesized by two of five melanoma lines.
 In parallel, we had analyzed the expression of four previously characterized melanoma cell surface antigens.

 A diagnosis of ovarian cancer was made by contributing pathologists on 477 subjects.
 Agreement between the two groups of pathologists was 97% for primary epithelial ovarian cancer and 89% for primary nonepithelial ovarian malignancies.
 Agreement on diagnosis of major cellular subtypes of ovarian malignancy ranged between 73% for endometrioid cancer and 100% for clear cell carcinomas.
 We conclude that the diagnosis of pathologic features of primary ovarian cancer is highly predictable.
 Nonetheless, diagnosis by histologic type varies sufficiently that a review process should be considered for clinical or investigative decisions involving specific histologic diagnoses of ovarian cancer.

 The primary structure of chromogranin A indicates multiple domains which might be subject to posttranslational modification.
 We explored chromogranin A's proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, and possible intermolecular disulfide links, using biochemical and cell biological approaches.
 Anti-chromogranin A region-specific immunoblots on chromaffin granules suggested bidirectional endoproteolytic cleavage of chromogranin A; control experiments ruled out artifactual cleavage during granule isolation or lysis.
 Isolation of chromogranin A-derived peptides by gel filtration chromatography or sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, established several cleavage sites, including at least two at dibasic sites.
 Secretion of chromogranin A from bovine chromaffin cells did not initiate further cleavage, nor did prolonged exposure of secreted chromogranins to the secretory cells.
 The chromogranin A cleavage pattern was qualitatively similar in other neuroendocrine tissues, though cleavage was more complete in adrenal medullary than in anterior pituitary hormone storage vesicles, and N-terminal fragments of 45 and 55 kilodaltons were more prominent in the hypothalamus.
 A similar cleavage pattern was seen in human pheochromocytoma granules, as judged by chromogranin A region-specific immunoblots, fragment isolation by SDS-PAGE, and microsequencing.
 The presence of full-length chromogranin A as the core protein of a chromaffin granule soluble proteoglycan was suggested in bovine (but not human) chromaffin granules by glycoprotein staining, chondroitinase ABC digestion, chemical deglycosylation, and region-specific immunoblotting.
 Human (but not bovine) chromogranin A displayed intermolecular disulfide crosslinks on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotting.
 These results document diverse structural paths that the chromogranin A molecule may take in endocrine secretory cells after its translation.

 Membrane-bound carbohydrates may influence the metastatic behavior of cancer cells.
 Forty-two squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the buccal and maxillary alveolar mucosa were studied retrospectively using a monoclonal antibody (BE2) that reacts with blood group H (type 2 chain) structure.
 H-antigen staining within the entire tumor did not correlate with the stage of the tumor, i.e., spread of the tumors.
 However, loss of staining within the most invasive sites of the tumors correlated significantly with the stage of tumor development and histologic grade of malignancy.
 These findings support the view that features relating to the cells of deeper parts of the carcinomas are very important for the clinical behavior of the tumors, and that loss of H-antigen expression is related to the stage of tumor and invasion of carcinoma cells.

 In hamster insulinoma (HIT) cells, maitotoxin (MTX) induces a time-dependent and concentration-dependent release of insulin that requires the presence of extracellular calcium.
 The response is nearly completely blocked by cinnarizine and cadmium, but is not inhibited by the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine or by manganese.
 MTX induces 45Ca+ uptake in these cells in a dose-dependent mode, and the uptake is blocked with cinnarizine, nifedipine and cadmium, and is partially inhibited by manganese.
 MTX induces phosphoinositide breakdown in HIT cells, and the response is partially blocked by cadmium, but is not affected by nifedipine, cinnarizine or manganese.
 High concentrations of potassium ions also induce insulin release and calcium uptake in HIT cells.
 Both effects of potassium are blocked partially by nifedipine, cadmium and cinnarizine.
 High concentrations of potassium do not induce phosphoinositide breakdown in HIT cells.
 The results suggest that MTX-elicited release of insulin is attained by two mechanisms: 1) a nifedipine-sensitive action, which results from MTX-induced activation of L-type calcium channels, which can be mimicked with high potassium concentrations; and 2) a nifedipine-insensitive action, which may be initiated by the activation of phosphoinositide breakdown by MTX.
 Such an activation of phospholipase C would result in the formation of 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate, a release of intracellular calcium and then release of insulin to the extracellular space.
 Cinnarizine is proposed to block both MTX-elicited mechanisms, the first by blockade of calcium channels and the second by blocking 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate-induced release of internal calcium.
 Either mechanism alone appears capable of eliciting release of insulin.

 When the inhaled O2:N2O ratio was 1:3 under enflurane anesthesia, mean PaO2 was 109.2 +/- 5.8 mm Hg, a rather high value when compared with that obtained when air is inhaled under atmospheric pressure.

 We report eight symptomatic patients seen over a 15-year period and review pathophysiologic mechanisms accounting for the three following distinct lower extremity ischemic sequelae: (1) Emboli--episodic focal digital ischemia (blue toe) was seen in three patients.
 Resection and primary anastomosis of focal iliac ulcerative fibromuscular dysplasia (one patient) or resection and replacement (two patients) removed the embolic source and relieved the symptoms.
 (2) Chronic ischemia--gradual onset of full leg claudication in four patients was treated by operative graduated intraluminal dilation in three patients and prosthetic bypass in one.
 Arteriography subsequently showed a remodeled lumen in the three patients who underwent dilation.
 (3) Dissection--acute onset leg ischemia resulted from presumed dissection of the external iliac segment.
 After 4 months of conservative management of antiplatelet agents and exercise, symptoms resolved completely, and arteriogram showed spontaneous restoration of a normal lumen in the dissected segment.
 The clinical presentation of fibromuscular dysplasia may mimic other arterial processes such as atherosclerosis.
 Diagnosis is made only by arteriography with specific magnification views of the external iliac arteries and careful surveillance of the renal arteries.
 Appropriate treatment should be tailored to the clinical presenting symptom.
 For microembolic disease, resection and replacement are required.
 For chronic ischemia, intraluminal dilation is generally sufficient and durable and has proved to be a simpler and acceptable alternative to replacement or bypass.
 In acute dissection, surgical intervention may be deferred if the limb is viable to allow spontaneous healing and remodeling.
 Persistent symptoms may be the only indication for intervention in this ischemic manifestation of external iliac fibromuscular dysplasia.

 Recent experimental work has identified a novel intracellular binding site for the synthetic progestin, Gestodene, that appears to be uniquely expressed in human breast cancer cells.
 Gestodene is shown here to inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion, but has no effect on endocrine-responsive human endometrial cancer cells.
 Gestodene induced a 90-fold increase in the secretion of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) by T47D human breast cancer cells.
 Other synthetic progestins had no effect, indicating that this induction is mediated by the novel Gestodene binding site and not by the conventional progesterone receptor.
 Furthermore, in four breast cancer cell lines, the extent of induction of TGF-beta correlated with intracellular levels of Gestodene binding site.
 No induction of TGF-beta was observed with the endometrial cancer line, HECl-B, which lacks the Gestodene binding site, but which expresses high levels of progesterone receptor.
 The inhibition of growth of T47D cells by Gestodene is partly reversible by a polyclonal antiserum to TGF-beta.
 These data indicate that the growth-inhibitory action of Gestodene may be mediated in part by an autocrine induction of TGF-beta.

 At 28 weeks of age, average systolic blood pressure of treated SHR was 113 +/- 3 mm Hg, which was below that of control SHR (188 +/- 3 mm Hg) and WKY rats (124 +/- 3 mm Hg).
 Body weight and heart rate of the SHR were not affected by the treatment.
 Tissue level of catecholamines was increased by captopril treatment in the superior cervical ganglia but remained unchanged in the plasma, heart, mesenteric arteries, and the adrenal glands of both SHR and WKY rats.
 Left ventricular weight, wall thickness, and internal diameter of the left ventricle in the SHR were reduced by the treatment.
 Morphometric measurements of the mesenteric arteries showed that vascular alterations present in the control SHR were prevented by the treatment.
 In the superior mesenteric artery and large mesenteric artery, smaller lumen size at maximal relaxation found in the control SHR was normalized to the level of the WKY rats.
 Hypertrophy of the medial wall in the superior mesenteric, large and small mesenteric arteries, and an increase in the number of smooth muscle cell layers in the large mesenteric artery of the SHR were prevented by the treatment.
 Perfusion study of the mesenteric vascular bed showed that reactivity of these vessels to norepinephrine was reduced, and sensitivity to norepinephrine (as determined by the effective dose that causes 50% of maximal response) was increased in the SHR by captopril treatment.
 Sensitivity of the tail artery in response to norepinephrine was not altered by the treatment.

 Numerous studies have assessed the ability of exercise modalities to predict patient outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
 Implicit in the use of these prior data to assess the prognosis of patients currently undergoing exercise studies is the assumption that patients selected for exercise assessment are similar over time and that the data generated in the past are therefore applicable to the current patient populations.
 This study retrospectively assessed the clinical, exercise, and rest and exercise radionuclide angiographic data in 791 consecutive patients referred for exercise radionuclide angiography within 1 month after AMI during a 5-year period to determine if the clinical and exercise characteristics of patients referred for exercise evaluation after infarction have changed significantly over time.
 Most parameters examined demonstrated significant increasing trends, including thrombolytic therapy at the time of AMI, revascularization procedure between AMI and exercise assessment, age, beta-blocker usage, Q-wave AMI, inferior infarction, exercise double product, exercise capacity, significant ST-segment depression with exercise, peak ejection fraction, and change in ejection fraction with exercise.
 These data indicate that the characteristics of patients selected to undergo exercise after AMI in a large referral center have changed significantly over time.
 If these data are applicable to other referral centers and to other exercise testing modalities, previously published results regarding exercise assessment after AMI will need to be reconfirmed in patients currently selected for testing, since these results may no longer be applicable in this current era of aggressive medical and interventional management.

1583,"Effects of doxazosin on blood pressure, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and urinary kallikrein.
 Doxazosin, a new quinazoline-derivative postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, was studied in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study.
 Its effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate, metabolic functions and renal hormones were analyzed after administration of a single oral morning dose in a 3-phase fashion when administered to 17 patients (11 women, 6 men, 21 to 59 years) with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension.
 After titrating the antihypertensive effective dose biweekly from 1 to 8 mg/day and a mean end titration-point dose of 4.14 +/- 0.1 mg (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at week 8 of treatment, it was adjusted to maintain diastolic BP at levels less than or equal to 90 mm Hg for up to 12 weeks of treatment when, at a final mean dose of 4.35 +/- 0.2 mg/day, BP decreased in all patients by a mean 31 +/- 3/17 +/- 2 (supine) and 39 +/- 3/15 +/- 3 (standing) mm Hg (p less than 0.005) with no increase in heart rate and no ""first-dose phenomenon."" Neither the renin-aldosterone system nor electrolyte excretion was significantly affected.
 Renal function and metabolic parameters also remained unchanged.
 Urinary kallikrein excretion was augmented 2.47-fold (p less than 0.002).
 There was good tolerance; 1 patient discontinued the study because of dry nose.
 These results suggest that long-term monotherapy with doxazosin is an effective and safe antihypertensive agent for mild to moderate essential hypertension that stimulates urinary kallikrein excretion.

 Percutaneous catheter ablation using radiofrequency energy can be used to interrupt atrioventricular (AV) conduction in patients with supraventricular tachycardia refractory to drugs.
 Results of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction using a custom-designed catheter with a large, 3-mm-long distal electrode, 2-mm interelectrode spacing, and a shaft with increased torsional rigidity were compared with those using a standard quadripolar electrode catheter (Bard EP).
 An electrocoagulator (Microvasive Bicap 4005) supplied unmodulated radiofrequency current at 550 kHz, which was applied between the distal electrode of the ablation catheter and a large skin electrode.
 With use of the modified catheter, 12 of 13 patients (92%) had persistent complete AV block induced with 7 +/- 5 applications of 18 +/- 6 W of radiofrequency power.
 In contrast, complete AV block was produced in only 9 of 18 (50%) historical control patients treated with the standard catheter, despite a similar number of applications (7 +/- 5) and power output (16 +/- 4 W).
 A rise in impedance, due to desiccation of tissue and coagulum formation, occurred earlier (28 +/- 18 vs 52 +/- 24 seconds, p less than 0.001) and more frequently (54 vs 40% of applications, p = 0.047) in patients treated with the standard catheter than in patients treated with the modified catheter.
 The use of a catheter designed to increase the surface area of electrode-tissue contact allows more radiofrequency energy to be delivered before a rise in impedance occurs and appears to increase the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction.

 Conjunctival fibroblastic proliferation with contracting scar formation has been implicated as a possible cause of glaucoma filtering surgery failure.
 The effects of glaucoma medications on bulbar conjunctiva were evaluated in both eyes of 20 pigmented rabbits, with 5 rabbits per group each receiving singular topically applied daily doses of either 0.5% timolol, 1% epinephrine, 4% pilocarpine, or artificial tears in a masked fashion for 4 months.
 Posterior lip sclerectomies were performed in 16 rabbits--4 from each treatment group.
 The remaining four rabbits served as nonsurgical controls.
 Four additional rabbits, which had not received eye drops, were included as a nonmedicated control group, with one rabbit serving as a nonsurgical control.
 Immunostaining was performed to identify the presence of myofibroblasts in fistulized conjunctiva.
 Treated surgical eyes, regardless of medication, had higher myofibroblastic cell proliferation than treated nonsurgical eyes.
 Among fistulized eyes, all medications increased cell proliferation, with pilocarpine eliciting the most dramatic increase compared with all other groups.

 In order to quantitate the subepithelial microvascular volume and its relation to the airway lumen, we conducted a morphometric analysis of the vascular compartment in the wall of the trachea (within a 55-microns depth from the epithelial basement membrane) and of 1.0 and 0.5-mm bronchioles of sheep.
 The lungs were fixed by bronchial and pulmonary artery perfusion with glutaraldehyde under three experimental conditions: (1) bronchial artery pressure, 100 mm Hg pulmonary artery pressure, 20 mm Hg (control); (2) bronchial artery pressure, 100 mm Hg, pulmonary artery pressure, 40 mm Hg (pulmonary hypertension, PH); (3) bronchial artery pressure, 100 mm Hg, pulmonary artery pressure, 40 mm Hg (pharmacologic vasodilation with sodium nitroprusside, PH + V).
 Venous pressures were atmospheric.
 Under control conditions, the microvascular volume fraction comprised 12, 16, and 15% of the subepithelial tissue in the trachea and 1-mm and 0.5-mm bronchioles, respectively.
 PH increased the microvascular volume fraction in the bronchioles (p less than 0.05), but it had no effect on the microvasculature in the trachea.
 PH + V approximately doubled the microvascular volume fraction in the trachea and the bronchioles.
 PH increased the mean wall thickness, and PH and PH + V decreased the airway cross-sectional area in the 1-mm bronchioles.
 These observations demonstrate that the microvasculature constitutes a considerable volume fraction of the subepithelial airway tissue and that vascular congestion can narrow the bronchiolar lumen.

 Epidural infusions of 10 micrograms/mL fentanyl combined with low-dose bupivacaine (0.1%) were compared with epidural infusions of fentanyl alone for postoperative analgesia after total knee joint replacement.
 There were no detectable differences between the two groups in analgesia (visual analogue scale ranging between 15 and 40 mm), infusion rates (which averaged 7-9 mL/h), or serum fentanyl levels (which reached 1-2 ng/mL).
 The incidence of side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and pruritus, was also similar.
 Of the patients receiving fentanyl and low-dose bupivacaine, one developed a transient unilateral motor and sensory loss, and one developed significant hypotension and respiratory depression.
 The addition of low-dose bupivacaine does not improve epidural fentanyl infusion analgesia after knee surgery and may increase morbidity.

 Adenoid enlargement is uncommon in adults and because examination of the nasopharynx by indirect posterior rhinoscopy is inadequate, many cases of enlarged adenoid in adults are misdiagnosed and accordingly maltreated.
 This study was conducted on 35 cases of enlarged adenoid aged between 20 and 42 years.
 The nasal endoscope was utilized to identify the adenoid mass.
 Adenoidectomy under transnasal endoscopic control was performed and all the excised material was sent for histopathological examination.
 Adenoidectomy resulted in marked improvement in 94 per cent of cases without major complications.
 Histopathological examination revealed non-specific inflammatory reaction in 15 cases (43 per cent), pure reactive changes, predominantly follicular hyperplasia, in two cases (6 per cent) and mixed pattern in 18 cases (51 per cent).
 Endoscopic follow-up for an average 17 months identified recurrence in only two patients.
 It was concluded that enlarged adenoid tissue in adults has some histopathological differences from that in children and adenoidectomy under transnasal endoscopic control is safe and reliable.

1589,"Implications of a dynamical systems approach to understanding infant kicking behavior.
 Implications of the dynamical systems approach to understanding movement dysfunction in infants are discussed.
 Traditional theories of motor development attribute changes in movement to the hierarchical maturation of the central nervous system.
 The dynamical systems approach emphasizes that movement self-organizes as the result of the interaction of the participating subsystems in developmental and real time.
 In this article, I discuss, from the theoretical perspective of the dynamical systems approach, the organization of leg movements in low- and high-risk preterm and full-term infants, developmental changes in movement in low-risk preterm infants from 34 weeks' gestational age to 40 weeks' postgestational age, and differences in movement between low-risk preterm infants at 40 weeks' postgestational age and full-term infants.
 Preliminary data on high-risk preterm infants are presented.
 Based on these data, the necessity to review and reinterpret traditional concepts of motor development is explored.
 Suggestions are offered and questions posed on how the dynamical systems perspective may influence the practice of physical therapy in the evaluation, and treatment of infants at risk for movement dysfunction.

 In early spring of 1988, questionnaires were mailed to 4,000 Midwestern physicians to survey their attitudes and practices regarding elevated serum cholesterol and their use of referrals for nutrition counseling; 633 physicians responded.
 Sixty-eight percent of the physicians thought that reducing high serum cholesterol levels would substantially affect heart disease; however, physicians attributed considerably less preventive value to reducing the cholesterol level than to reducing blood pressure (80.3%) or ceasing smoking (90.0%).
 The range of serum cholesterol for which diet therapy was most frequently initiated was 5.70 to 6.20 mmol/L.
 The most frequent range for initiation of drug therapy was 7.80 to 8.25 mmol/L.
 The physicians reported that although their medical school training did not prepare them adequately for providing diet counseling, they did feel prepared to provide, and were successful in, counseling on diet modifications for reducing serum cholesterol.
 Few (10%) of the total sample reported having registered dietitians available for dietary counseling, and most (88.8%) believed that it is the physician's responsibility to provide such counseling.
 Although the low response rate limits the conclusions of the survey, it is likely that those physicians most interested in the topic responded.
 We conclude that registered dietitians should explore the need for their special services further.
 More aggressive marketing of dietetic services could benefit both physicians and patients in the campaign to reduce serum cholesterol.

1592,"Analysis and predictors of pulmonary vascular resistance after cardiac transplantation.
 Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is a known risk factor for early death from acute right ventricular failure after orthotopic cardiac transplantation.
 Patients in whom the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is due primarily to increased left atrial pressure (""reactive"") frequently have normalization of resistance after transplantation, but few studies have detailed the time course and magnitude of these changes.
 To analyze the response of pulmonary vascular resistance to cardiac transplantation, we analyzed data from 4353 right heart catheterizations on all 182 patients undergoing cardiac transplantation between 1981 and Jan.
 1, 1990.
 Before transplantation 18% of patients had a pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 4 WU, 16% had a pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 60 mm Hg, and 16% had a transpulmonary gradient greater than 14 mm Hg.
 In the overall group of patients, pulmonary vascular resistance (mean value 2.63 WU), transpulmonary gradient (mean value 9.9 mm Hg), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (mean value 48.0 mm Hg) were normalized within 1 week of cardiac transplantation.
 In patients with a high preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance (greater than or equal to 4 WU), the resistance fell promptly within 1 week of transplantation but continued to be slightly elevated throughout the period of follow-up.
 By multiple regression analysis, pulmonary vascular resistance at 1 week and 1 year after transplantation was significantly correlated with the pretransplantation resistance.
 Pulmonary vascular resistance anytime after transplantation was related to preoperative resistance, body surface area, and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure.
 Inferences: (1) As a group, cardiac transplant recipients have a normal pulmonary vascular resistance, transpulmonary gradient, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure within 1 week after transplantation with little change thereafter for at least several years.
 (2) Patients with reversible elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance before cardiac transplantation typically have a reactive and a fixed component.
 Cardiac transplantation relieves the reactive but not the fixed component.
 As a result, pulmonary vascular resistance early (within 1 week) and late after transplantation will have fallen but not completely normalized.

 Using data from a large, nationally representative sample, multiple regressions using sex, ethnicity, age and educational status showed that drinking patterns of college students differed significantly from those of dropouts, high school graduates and former college students.
 College students were more likely to use alcohol but tended to drink less quantity per drinking day than nonstudents of the same age.
 Sex differences were smaller among college students than among other groups, especially in proportions of abstainers.
 While whites were most likely to drink if they were in college, among blacks the college students were the least likely to drink.
 Age had little association with drinking.

 Osmotic minipumps that dispensed either nicotine (2.4 mg/kg/day) or saline were implanted in DOCA and normotensive rats for 18 days.
 Anesthetized DOCA-nicotine, DOCA-saline, control-nicotine, and control-saline rats had mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 117 +/- 3, 110 +/- 9, 90 +/- 3, and 89 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively.
 Nicotine decreased the sensitivity (p less than 0.05) of baroreceptor reflex control of RNA (% delta RNA/delta MAP) in the DOCA-nicotine rats (-0.92 +/- 0.08) compared with the DOCA-saline (-1.44 +/- 0.16), control-nicotine (-1.45 +/- 0.08), or control-saline (-1.45 +/- 0.21) rats.

 To study the influence of left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG), quantitative and qualitative analyses of SAECG parameters were undertaken in 48 patients with electrocardiographic evidence of intrinsic LBBB and in 39 patients with a ""normal"" surface QRS duration (less than 120 msec) who underwent right ventricular pacing-induced LBBB.
 We assumed pacing of the right ventricular apex to be a suitable model of this conduction defect.
 Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) was inducible in 16 of 48 patients with intrinsic LBBB and in 23 of 39 patients with pacing-induced LBBB.
 Utilizing a filter setting of 25 to 250 Hz, late potentials were defined as a total filtered QRS duration greater than or equal to 120 msec, a root mean square voltage in the terminal 40 msec (RMS 40) of less than or equal to 25 microV, and the duration of signals less than 40 microV (LAS 40) of greater than or equal to 38 msec.
 Only RMS 40 and LAS 40 criteria were used in patients with LBBB.
 Prolongation of LAS 40 and fragmentation of signals in the terminal portion of the filtered QRS were characteristic of all patients with LBBB aberration.
 Of those patients with intrinsic LBBB, the mean total filtered QRS duration, RMS 40, and LAS 40 for inducible and noninducible patients were significantly different (170 +/- 28, 16 +/- 10, 55 +/- 24, and 153 +/- 18 msec, 25 +/- 10 microV, 33 +/- 16.9 msec; p = 0.04, 0.009, and 0.007, respectively).
 Noninducible patients with a normal QRS duration demonstrated a 60% decrement in the mean RMS 40 value during pacing-induced LBBB.
 These changes resulted in a 59% false positive incidence of late potentials during pacing-induced LBBB.
 This correlated with a similarly low mean RMS 40 value in patients with intrinsic LBBB and no inducible SMVT, hence giving rise to a false positive incidence of late potentials of 63%.
 Since ""standard"" RMS 40 and LAS 40 criteria resulted in low specificity and positive predictive value, new parameters were selected and analyzed.
 The combination of RMS 40 less than or equal to 17 microV plus LAS 40 greater than or equal to 55 msec yielded the best overall statistical result, with a sensitivity, specificity, and total predictive accuracy of 69%, 81%, and 77%, respectively.
 In conclusion: (1) A reduction of RMS 40, prolongation of LAS 40, and fragmentation of signals in the terminal portion of the filtered QRS are characteristics of LBBB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

 OBJECTIVE--To examine the association between the serum lipoprotein (a) concentration and subsequent coronary heart disease.
 DESIGN--Prospective case-control study based on a six year follow up of a general population sample of men aged 50 at baseline in 1983-4.
 Serum samples were frozen at the time of the baseline examination and kept at -70 degrees C for six years, after which the lipoprotein (a) concentrations in the samples were measured in cases and controls.
 SETTING--City of Gothenburg, Sweden.
 SUBJECTS--26 Men, from a general population sample of 776 men, who had sustained a myocardial infarction or died of coronary heart disease during the six years and 109 randomly selected controls from the same sample who had remained free of myocardial infarction.
 In neither cases nor controls was there a history of myocardial infarction at baseline.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Proportion of myocardial infarction or deaths from coronary heart disease, or both, in relation to the serum lipoprotein (a) concentration.
 RESULTS--Men who suffered coronary heart disease had significantly higher serum lipoprotein (a) concentrations than controls (mean difference 105 mg/l; 95% confidence interval 18 to 192 mg/l).
 Men with the highest fifth of serum lipoprotein (a) concentrations (cut off point 365 mg/l) suffered a coronary heart disease rate which was more than twice that of men with the lowest four fifths of concentrations.
 Logistic regression analysis showed the serum lipoprotein (a) concentration to be significantly associated with coronary heart disease independently of other risk factors.
 CONCLUSION--The serum lipoprotein (a) concentration in middle aged men is an independent risk factor for subsequent myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease.

 To assess the incidence and clinical significance of elevated total plasma creatine kinase (CK) and MB isoenzyme fraction after apparently successful coronary angioplasty, a prospective study of 272 consecutive elective procedures was undertaken.
 Total CK (normal less than 100 IU/liter) and CK MB isoenzyme (normal less than 4%) were measured immediately after successful completion of the procedure and every 6 h for 24 h.
 All nonelective procedures and results not fulfilling all American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Task Force guideline criteria for a successful result were excluded from analysis.
 Of the 272 elective procedures, 249 (92%) were successfully; abnormally elevated CK or CK MB serum levels, or both, were found in 38 (15%) of the successful outcomes.
 Three patterns of abnormal enzymes were identified: 15 patients with CK greater than or equal to 200 IU/liter and CK MB greater than or equal to 5% (group 1), 4 patients with CK greater than or equal to 200 IU/litter and CK MB less than or equal to 4% (group 2) and 19 patients with CK less than 200 IU/liter and CK MB greater than or equal to 5% (group 3).
 The three groups were distinguishable by the nature of the complications causing the enzyme release (in particular, the etiology and clinical manifestations).
 There were significantly more clinically apparent events in group 1 than in the other groups (13 of 15 versus 11 of 23, p less than 0.01) and more events associated with persistent electrocardiographic changes (p = 0.05) and chest pain (p less than 0.05).
 However, no clinically important sequelae were recognizable in any group at hospital discharge.

 The effects of antihypertensive drugs on mortality from stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), and nonvascular causes have been studied in 14 trials involving more than 37,000 patients.
 In the treated patients, blood pressure was 5 to 6 mm Hg lower than that in placebo-treated patients, and whereas mortality from stroke was reduced by 42%, CAD mortality was reduced by only 14%.
 A major reason for this lack of effect on CAD mortality is apparently the adverse effects of the primary drugs used in these trials (diuretics and beta blockers) on glucose tolerance, lipid levels, and insulin resistance.
 The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors favorably influence many CAD risk factors, and their use can be expected to reduce CAD mortality in patients treated for hypertension.

 This approach was also used to assess the stability of mRNAs in brains that were incubated in oxygenated mammalian Ringer's solution for various lengths of time and from brains that were freshly frozen and then thawed at room temperature.
 Oocytes injected with mRNA from up to 21-hr postmortem brains gave large agonist- and voltage-activated responses, indicating that mRNAs encoding neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-activated channels are relatively stable in postmortem brain tissue.
 In contrast, oocytes injected with mRNA from brains incubated in Ringer's solution exhibited smaller responses, and oocytes injected with mRNA from tissue that was frozen and then thawed displayed very small or undetectable responses.
 Northern blot analysis using a nucleic acid probe for rat brain Na(+)-channel mRNA indicated that the size of the Na+ currents in injected oocytes reflected the levels of mRNA for Na+ channels in the different mRNA preparations.
 Thus, the expressional potency of mRNAs encoding neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-activated channels is quite stable in postmortem brains in situ, but it is reduced if the brains are kept in oxygenated saline, and freezing and thawing of tissue results in rapid degeneration of mRNA.

 Tumor-specific cytotoxicity was measured in fresh human biopsy specimens by a modification of the differential staining cytotoxicity assay.
 ImuVert, a cytokine inducer derived from Serratia marcescens, which produces broad-spectrum activation of both macrophages and lymphocytes, was dramatically more effective when it was tested in tumors obtained from patients with previously treated, chemotherapy-responsive adenocarcinomas (breast and ovary) than when it was tested in tumors obtained from either previously untreated patients or previously treated patients with chemotherapy-refractory adenocarcinomas (colon, lung, pancreas, stomach, kidney, gallbladder, uterus, and prostate).
 Similar findings, relating to prior chemotherapy treatment status, were obtained for tumor necrosis factor and interferon gamma, but not for interleukin-2 or interferon alpha.
 On the basis of these findings and on other evidence in the literature, we speculate that response to chemotherapy produces massive release and processing of tumor antigens.
 We further speculate that this response leads to a state in which the human immune system is primed (via in situ vaccination) to respond to exogenous macrophage-activation signals with potent, specific antitumor effects.

 Suicides, homicides, motor vehicle crashes, and other violent deaths and injuries are linked inextricably to alcoholism.
 The association of injury and alcoholism should be particularly obvious to Emergency Department (ED) physicians.
 We sought to determine the extent to which intoxicated patients in an ED were properly diagnosed, counselled, and referred for substance abuse care.
 We reviewed the charts of 153 consecutive patients seen in a teaching hospital ED who had blood alcohol levels above 100 mg%.
 Most were male (70%), white (62%), young (mean age, 34 years) and severely intoxicated (mean BAL, 245; range, 109-558 mg%).
 Forty-six per cent of visits were for trauma; half of the patients were victims of violent assaults.
 The intoxicated patients received extensive medical and surgical management: an average of five tests or X-rays were performed per patient; 75% received at least one medication; at discharge 48% were referred for followup to medical or surgical clinics.
 In contrast, few patients were evaluated for dangerous behaviors or referred for treatment of alcoholism: only 19 patients (12.5%) were asked about depression, suicide, or homicide; 15% were advised to stop drinking; 13% received a referral to a psychiatrist, mental health worker, or alcohol rehabilitation facility.

 Respiratory reactance (Xrs; in cmH2O.l-1.s) was -22.2 +/- 5.9 at 0.25 Hz and reached zero at approximately 14 Hz and 2.3 +/- 0.8 at 32 Hz.
 Effective respiratory elastance (Ers = -2pi x frequency x Xrs; in cmH2O/1) was 34.8 +/- 9.2 at 0.25 Hz and increased markedly with frequency up to 44.2 +/- 8.6 at 2 Hz.
 We interpreted Zrs data in terms of a T network mechanical model.
 We represented the proximal branch by central airway resistance and inertance.
 The shunt pathway accounted for bronchial distensibility and alveolar gas compressibility.
 The distal branch included a Newtonian resistance component for tissues and peripheral airways and a viscoelastic component for tissues.
 When the viscoelastic component was represented by a Kelvin body as in the model of Bates et al.
 (J.
 Appl.
 Physiol.
 61: 873-880, 1986), a good fit was obtained over the entire frequency range, and reasonable values of parameters were estimated.
 The strong frequency dependence of Rrs and Ers observed below 2 Hz in our anesthetized paralyzed patients could be mainly interpreted in terms of tissue viscoelasticity.
 Nevertheless, the high Ers we found with low volume excursions suggests that tissues also exhibit plasticlike properties.

 Occurrence and significance of specific IgA and IgM to cytomegalovirus (CMV) in recurrent CMV infection was evaluated in 21 allogeneic T lymphocyte-depleted bone marrow transplantation (BMT) recipients who had been previously CMV seropositive.
 Of 17 patients with CMV infection, viruria was detected in 94%, CMV-specific IgA in 88% and IgM in 76%, and a fourfold rise in IgG in 65%.
 The median time between BMT and detection of viruria was 69 days, of IgA 70, of IgM 62, and of IgG 88 days.
 The IgM and IgA responses lasted for 14 and 30 days (median time), whereas high IgG titers persisted.
 Twelve patients developed CMV disease; in these the appearance of viruria, IgA, and IgM preceded the rise of IgG (P less than .02).
 CMV-specific IgA and IgM are valuable diagnostic tools in BMT recipients with recurrent CMV infection.

 Exercise-induced water concentration changes have been determined in the medial gastrocnemius muscle noninvasively with image-guided in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
 These measurements were performed on seven normal male volunteers during and after isometric and ischemic-isometric exercise at 5, 10, and 20% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC).
 The observed water flux changes during different phases of exercise have been interpreted in terms of fluid transfer between the vasculature and exercising muscle.
 Good correlation between individual MVC and changes in water fluxes and the decay of water content was observed after 20% MVC exercise level.
 MRS results have been found to be consistent with those reported in the literature based on invasive biopsy techniques.

 Although the fraction with higher molecular weight caused an increase in intraocular pressure, no change of this parameter was found after administration of the fraction with the lower molecular weight.
 Furthermore, various inflammatory reactions in ocular tissues were observed during slit-lamp biomicroscopy after administration of Healon but not of Ial.
 No inflammatory reaction was found after subchronic instillation of the compounds.

 Physician nonadherence to cancer treatment regimens may diminish treatment efficacy and compromise clinical research.
 The influence of clinical, demographic, and psychosocial patient characteristics on physician adherence to breast cancer chemotherapy was investigated, as was the role of the clinician's attitudes concerning the chemotherapy.
 One hundred seven women recently diagnosed with breast cancer were followed for 26 weeks of treatment.
 Fifty-six (52%) of the patients experienced unjustified modification for at least one chemotherapeutic agent.
 Stepwise multiple regression revealed independent contributions of increased patient age, treatment setting (clinic versus academic or community private practice), and stage of disease to physician nonadherence.
 Regimen complexity, delay in seeking treatment, and presence of psychiatric disorder did not contribute, in general, to unjustified regimen modifications.
 Patient psychological and psychiatric factors, however, did influence prescribing behavior for vincristine.
 Physician awareness of factors contributing to unnecessary treatment modifications may reduce the frequency of such behaviors.

 Three hundred eighty-one children with Wilms' tumor were treated in the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group WT1 Study (1982 to 1986).
 Seventy-one patients had relapses during or after treatment with surgery and chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, depending on stage and histologic characteristics.
 Forty-nine patients were evaluable for disease response to second-line chemotherapy alone.
 Evaluation of response to chemotherapy was impossible in the remaining patients because either surgery or radiation therapy was used at the time of relapse.
 With second-line combination chemotherapy (which included ifosfamide, etoposide/VM26, cisplatin/carboplatin, bleomycin, melphalan, and Thiotepa [Lederle Laboratories, Pearl River, NY]), there were five complete responses and 12 partial responses.
 In patients with favorable histologic findings, six of nine with Stage I, five of ten with Stage II, none of 11 with Stage III, three of 16 with Stage IV, and one of five with Stage V disease survived.
 Two survivors were treated with chemotherapy alone; the others received combined treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery.
 For those with unfavorable histologic findings of any stage, only two of 20 survived.
 The authors conclude that, even for patients with localized disease with favorable histologic findings, the ""salvage"" rate is little more than 50%, and for all other stages and histologic findings the likelihood of cure after relapse is remote.
 There is clearly a need for additional effective chemotherapeutic agents for these patients.

 The purpose of this study were the following: a) to determine the prevalence of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among veterans seeking assistance at a Veterans Administration medical center substance abuse treatment facility, b) to examine the relative contribution of Vietnam war zone variables to PTSD symptom development, and c) to study psychosocial adjustment problems associated with Vietnam combat exposure and with PTSD symptoms among help-seeking substance abusing men.
 Of 489 male veterans presenting for treatment, 10.7% had significant Vietnam combat-related PTSD symptoms as measured by the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD.
 Clinically significant PTSD symptoms occurred among 46% of the subsample of combat-exposed Vietnam veterans with substance abuse problems.
 Degree of combat exposure was the most important military stressor that distinguished Vietnam veterans with PTSD from those without PTSD, but the groups also differed on age of war zone duty, duration of war zone duty, and whether they were wounded.
 Veterans who served in Vietnam did not differ from veterans who had no war zone duty on various parameters of psychosocial adjustment.
 However, the subgroup of Vietnam veterans with PTSD symptoms reported significantly greater psychosocial adjustment problems than their counterparts who did not have PTSD.
 The deleterious effects associated with combat-related PTSD appeared to be confined to adjunctive psychiatric difficulties and unemployment and did not increase risk of arrests for antisocial conduct beyond that found for veterans without PTSD.

1615,"Cardiac myosin-induced myocarditis. Heart autoantibodies are not involved in the induction of the disease.
 We recently demonstrated that cardiac myosin is capable of inducing autoimmune myocarditis in genetically predisposed mice.
 This disease parallels coxsackievirus B3-induced autoimmune myocarditis in many respects and is associated with high-titer autoantibodies specific for cardiac myosin.
 The following lines of evidence suggest that these autoantibodies are not involved in the induction of autoimmune myocarditis: 1) immunoperoxidase staining of heart sections from cardiac myosin-immunized A/J and A.SW mice revealed IgG depositions only along damaged muscle fibres in infiltrated areas, but not in intact tissue; 2) myosin autoantibodies did not bind to the surface of viable cardiac myocytes isolated from mice, but only reacted with myocytes permeabilized with detergent; 3) mice treated with a single high dose of cyclophosphamide, which reduces the humoral immune response, still developed severe myocarditis, despite the fact that their autoantibody titers were reduced to the level of adjuvant-injected controls; and 4) passive transfer of high-titer myosin autoantibodies failed to induce myocarditis, although the titers in the recipients were comparable to those found in mice with cardiac myosin-induced disease.
 Together, the results suggest that high-titer myosin autoantibodies are secondary rather than primary to the disease.

1616,"Rehabilitative techniques for athletes after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament [published erratum appears in Mayo Clin Proc 1991 Jan;66(1):114]
 A wide spectrum of protocols is available for rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and little agreement exists on the specifics of strengthening exercises or the sequence of activities.
 In this article, we discuss the current rehabilitative techniques used at the Mayo Clinic for athletes who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
 These techniques are based on established principles of rehabilitation, clinical experience, and new information about the related biomechanics of the knee.
 An illustrative case reflects the benefits of this rehabilitation program, which lasts up to 1 year and is divided into five stages.
 The early stages focus on protected mobilization and a strengthening program that emphasizes closed rather than open kinetic chain exercises.
 Later, neuromuscular-proprioceptive training and sport-specific agility training redevelop the reaction time and the ""coordination engrams"" necessary for athletic competition.
 High-quality surgical care and a closely supervised rehabilitation program, based on kinesiologic and biomechanical factors as they pertain to the anterior cruciate ligament, are necessary for a successful outcome.

1617,"Small-volume resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock in dogs: effects on systemic hemodynamics and systemic blood flow.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: This study compared canine systemic hemodynamics and organ blood flow (radioactive microsphere technique) after resuscitation with 0.8% saline (Na+ 137 mEq/L), 7.2% hypertonic saline (Na+ 1233 mEq/L), 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.8% saline, or 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 7.2% saline, each in a volume approximating 15% of shed blood volume.
 Twenty-four endotracheally intubated mongrel dogs (18 to 24 kg) underwent a 30-min period of hemorrhagic shock, from time 0 to 30 min into the shock period, followed by fluid resuscitation.
 Data were collected at baseline, 15 min into the shock period, immediately after fluid infusion, 5 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and at 60-min intervals for 2 hr, (65 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and 125 min after the beginning of resuscitation).
 The animals received one of four randomly assigned iv resuscitation fluids: saline (54 mL/kg), hypertonic saline (6.0 mL/kg), hydroxyethel starch (6.0 mL/kg) or hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch (6.0 mL/kg).
 RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure increased in all groups after resuscitation.
 Cardiac output increased with resuscitation in all groups, exceeding baseline in the saline and hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch groups (p less than .05 compared with hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch).
 Sixty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, cardiac output was significantly (p less than .05) greater in either of the two colloid-containing groups than in the hypertonic saline group.
 After resuscitation, hypertonic saline and hydroxyethyl starch produced minimal improvements in hepatic arterial flow, hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch increased hepatic arterial flow to near baseline levels, and saline markedly increased hepatic arterial flow to levels exceeding baseline (p less than .05, saline vs.
 hydroxyethyl starch).
 One hundred twenty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, hepatic arterial flow had decreased in all groups; hepatic arterial flow in the hypertonic saline group had decreased to levels comparable with those during shock.
 Myocardial, renal, and brain blood flow were not significantly different between groups.
 CONCLUSIONS: Small-volume resuscitation with the combination of hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch is comparable with much larger volumes of 0.8% saline, and is equal to hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch in the ability to restore and sustain BP and improve organ blood flow after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock.

 OBJECTIVE--Evaluation of detection of hypertension in adults in the county of Nord-Trondelag, Norway.
 DESIGN--Cross sectional survey with clinical follow up examinations.
 SETTING--Health survey by screening teams from the national health screening service, and examinations by all 106 general practitioners in the county.
 SUBJECTS--During 1984-6, 74,977 persons (88.1% of those aged 20 years and over) participated in the health survey.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Hypertension (when assessed by standardised recording and by questionnaires on drug treatment for hypertension) according to the blood pressure thresholds used in the Norwegian treatment programme.
 Subjects positive on screening were grouped after clinical examination into treatment groups.
 RESULTS--In all, 2399 subjects were positive for hypertension.
 Before screening 6210 (8.3%) patients reported taking antihypertensive drugs and another 3849 (5.1%) had their blood pressure monitored regularly.
 All who screened positive were referred to their general practitioner and evaluated according to a standard programme.
 As a result, drug treatment was started in 406 (0.5%) participants screened and blood pressure monitoring in another 1007 (1.3%).
 Of all patients taking antihypertensive drugs after the screening, 6399 (94.0%) had been diagnosed before screening, and of those whose blood pressure was monitored after the screening, 79.3% had been diagnosed before screening.
 CONCLUSIONS--At the blood pressure screening thresholds used, and when hypertension is defined by an overall clinical diagnosis, the results indicate that general practitioners can find and diagnose hypertensive patients with the case finding strategy.

1619,"Secondary deposition of beta amyloid within extracellular neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer-type dementia.
 The hippocampal areas of 34 autopsy specimen brains from aged demented and nondemented subjects were examined using double staining of Bodian and beta protein.
 In 18 cases (75.5 +/- 7.4 years old), none of the extracellular neurofibrillary tangles (E-NFTs) were immunoreactive with beta protein.
 In 16 cases (82.9 +/- 5.4 years old), the minority of E-NFTs were immunoreactive with beta-protein antiserum.
 These beta-immunoreactive E-NFTs frequently appeared in the areas having senile plaques, while they were not observed in the area lacking beta-immunoreactive senile plaques.
 The ultrastructure of beta-immunoreactive E-NFTs revealed that they consisted of extracellular amyloid fibrils, extracellularly located bundles of paired helical filaments, astroglial processes and degenerating neurites.
 These findings suggest that the beta immunoreactivity of E-NFTs comes from secondary deposition of amyloid fibrils.

 Five hundred fifty-two cases of primary carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts (gallbladder and periampullary tumors excluded) collected from 55 surgical centers were reviewed retrospectively.
 Three hundred seven patients (56%) had upper-third lesions (proximal carcinoma), whereas 71 (13%) and 101 (18%), respectively, had middle-third and lower-third bile duct carcinomas.
 The remaining patients had diffuse lesions.
 Resectability rates were 32% for upper-third localization compared to 47% and 51% for middle-third and lower-third localization, respectively.
 The operative mortality rate for proximal carcinomas was significantly lower with resection (16%) compared with palliative surgery (31%) (p less than 0.05).
 Overall 1-year survival (operative deaths excluded) was 68% after tumor resection compared to 31% after palliative surgery (p less than 0.001).
 Long-term results after surgical resection correlated with local and regional extension of the disease.
 The results of this study show that resection of extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas, particularly in an upper-third localization, often is associated with worthwhile long-term survival.

 A prospective controlled randomized trial testing adjuvant postoperative combination chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, lomustine (CCNU) and vincristine) versus no adjuvant therapy in patients operated on for Dukes' C colorectal cancer is reported.
 In total 334 patients aged less than 70 years were recruited: 205 patients with colonic and 99 with rectal cancer, but there were three protocol violations and these cases are excluded from further consideration.
 Twenty-seven patients had a limited resection of their cancer.
 After 5 years' follow-up there was no significant difference in the tumour-free survival rate or in the survival rate between the treated and control groups.
 Twenty-nine of the 147 patients who started chemotherapy discontinued this treatment because of side-effects, mainly from the gastrointestinal tract.
 In 30 patients treatment was discontinued because of recurrent disease.
 The conclusion is that systemic administration of combination chemotherapy for colorectal cancer after operation is not worthwhile in routine clinical practice.

 Using data from these surveys, we tested for ordered increases over time in the prevalence of an indicator of multiple problems, considered on both a current (1-year) and lifetime basis.
 We studied prevalence in men and women between the ages of 22 and 59 in all four surveys.
 Prevalence of the multiple problem indicator was rare, especially when considered on a current basis.
 However, relative increases in prevalence ranging from 53% to over 200% were found from 1967 to 1984 in the multiple problem indicator for men and women, for lifetime as well as current problems.
 With the exception of current problems in women (a very rare condition even in the 1984 survey), these changes were all statistically significant or showed a trend toward significance.

 Whether the display medium--film versus cathode ray tube (CRT)--affects observer performance during interpretation of computed tomographic (CT) images is an important research issue in these times of implementation and growth of picture archiving and communications systems in radiology.
 The authors performed a multiobserver receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study to determine the performance of radiologists who read abdominal CT studies displayed on film, as well as on a high-resolution workstation (video monitor) that made use of three different display modes.
 A total of 166 examinations were evaluated by eight radiologists, who recorded their ordinal confidence ratings of the demonstration of presence or absence of abdominal masses.
 ROC analysis showed small differences in the confidence ratings assigned by individual readers for the detection and interpretation tasks.
 Results for the group as a whole showed no significant reduction or improvement in observer performance when ratings for any one of the workstation display modes were analyzed.
 The results of this study demonstrate that current CRT display technology is adequate for enabling the primary detection of abdominal masses with CT examinations.

 Unsuspected distal migration of the tip of the pulmonary artery catheter may cause life-threatening complications.
 We prospectively evaluated the clinical utility of the PA Watch Catheter in 25 patients after cardiac surgery by hourly measurements of pulmonary artery (distal lumen), right ventricular (middle lumen), and central venous (proximal lumen) pressures.
 The catheter was considered to be in the proper position when the middle lumen port, located 10 cm from the tip, transmitted a right ventricular pressure waveform.
 Satisfactory initial catheter placement was obtained in 24 of 25 patients.
 During the 28.4 +/- 1.8 h of postoperative monitoring, clinically unsuspected distal catheter migration, indicated by the presence of a pulmonary artery pressure waveform in the middle lumen port, occurred in 12 of the 25 patients (48%).

 Many studies in clinical oncology rely on hospital-derived patients.
 Hospitals vary in the proportions of patients from the local catchment area vs.
 those from more distant places, of whom a larger proportion are presumably referrals.
 To study the differences between these two types of patients, we analyzed 1,245 colorectal cancer patients seen at a large urban medical center over a seven-year period.
 Three hundred ninety-eight patients were from the local community (32 percent), 489 were from the extended community (39.3 percent), and 358 from more distant communities (28.8 percent).
 The patients from the local community tended to be older and from minority ethnic groups.
 In addition, the local community patients were more likely to have advanced disease at the time of presentation.
 The grade of the tumor and its site distribution within the large bowel were similar for the three groups.
 After adjusting for age, sex, race, and stage of disease, the survival was somewhat better for the distant community patients as compared with the local and extended communities (P less than 0.02).
 Overall, in our patient population, the distant patients tended to have more favorable socioeconomic factors and less advanced disease, and these differences may account, in large part, for a better prognosis for these patients.
 Particularly in large cooperative trials, studies may need to take into account the respective proportions of local community and geographically distant patients in analyzing and generalizing treatment outcomes.

 Transcripts for the muscle regulatory gene MyoD1 are expressed during normal skeletal muscle myogenesis and in rhabdomyosarcomas but not in other tissues or in soft-tissue sarcomas.
 Here we report the distribution of MyoD1 protein, determined by reactivity with anti-MyoD1 polyclonal sera in normal tissues, rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, and in a variety of pediatric solid tumors.
 The distribution of MyoD1 protein was highly restricted in normal tissues and was detected only in fetal skeletal muscle and more faintly in adult skeletal muscle.
 All six human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines analyzed expressed MyoD1 mRNA transcripts as well as immunoreactive protein.
 The immunohistochemical expression of MyoD1 protein was then examined in 49 surgical specimens from a variety of pediatric solid tumors.
 Each of 16 rhabdomyosarcoma specimens was positive for MyoD1, including four that did not express the intermediate filament protein desmin.
 Two of five specimens originally designated sarcoma type indeterminate (STI) and two of three specimens originally designated extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma (EOE) were positive for MyoD1, suggesting commitment to myogenic differentiation.
 Three of eight Wilms' tumors, which also expressed desmin and had clearly evident myogenic elements, also were positive for MyoD1.
 Tumors that failed to express MyoD1 protein included neuroblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, embryonal sarcoma of the liver, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor, and Ewing's sarcoma of the bone.
 These results indicate that expression of MyoD1 protein is highly restricted in normal human tissues and that expression of this gene product in malignant tissue may be diagnostic for rhabdomyosarcoma.
 Furthermore MyoD1 staining may be a valuable adjunct in the classification of pediatric soft-tissue sarcomas.

1635,"Percutaneous right brachial artery approach with 5F catheters for studying coronary artery disease.
 We prospectively studied 60 ischemic patients with 5F catheters (Pigtail and Amplatz) using the percutaneous right brachial artery approach (group I), in order to compare this technique with two groups of 100 patients each randomly studied by the femoral route with either 5F (group II) or 8F (group III) catheters (Pigtail and Judkins).
 The following parameters were analyzed: need to change the initially elected catheter diameter or/and artery approach; technical difficulty for obtaining LV, LCA, and RCA angiograms; total time of X-ray exposure; quality image of LV, LCA, and RCA angiograms; incidence of arterial puncture related hematomas or total arterial occlusion; and duration of local compression after sheath removal.
 There were no differences between 5F brachial and femoral approaches except for the arterial compression time (p less than 0.01) and the X-ray exposure time (p = 0.03) which were longer with the brachial approach.
 Whatever the route used, 5F showed a mild increase difficulty (brachial p = 0.001; femoral p = 0.01) and a mild decreased quality image for LCA (branchial p = 0.006; femoral p less than 0.05).
 Mild hematomas were more frequent with 8F catheters (p less than 0.05).
 The procedure could be completed by the elected first artery and type of catheter (5F or 8F) in 57/60 patients in group I, in 95/100 in group II, and in 96/100 in group III (nonsignificant differences).
 Thus, the percutaneous right brachial artery approach using 5F catheters is similar to the femoral artery approach with the same catheters.
 Although both of them showed a mild increased technical difficulty and a mild decreased quality image compared to 8F, mainly for LCA angiograms, they allowed complete and reliable angiograms reading and analysis.

1636,"Ventricular tachycardia during routine treadmill testing. Risk and prognosis.
 Exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia during exercise testing is considered to increase risk during testing.
 Moreover, exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia has been considered to confer a poor prognosis although this has not been specifically studied.
 On a retrospective review of 3351 patients who had undergone routine clinical exercise testing between September 1984 and June 1989, we identified 55 patients with exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia.
 The mean follow-up was 26 months (range, 2 to 58 months).
 Fifty patients had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during exercise testing and one of these patients died due to congestive heart failure during the follow-up period.
 Five patients had sustained ventricular tachycardia during exercise testing and one died suddenly 7 months after the test.
 Ventricular tachycardia was reproduced in only two of the 29 patients who underwent repeated exercise testing.
 Ventricular tachycardia during routine clinical exercise testing occurred rarely (prevalence of 1.5%) and was not associated with complications during testing.
 The total mortality in the exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia group (3.6%) was not significantly different from the mortality in the entire population (5.1%).
 Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurring during clinical exercise testing is not an independent marker of a poor prognosis.

 Fecal occult blood testing for the detection of colon cancer remains controversial.
 We performed a mass screening program from January 24, 1988, to February 19, 1988, with intensive media promotion, including 121 minutes of televised air time.
 A total of 5,000 primary practitioners were notified by mail.
 Hemoccult-II tests were distributed to 156,000 individuals; 55,051 (35%) were returned.
 Ninety-five percent of the respondents were informed of the program by television.
 A total of 3,375 persons (6%) tested positive for fecal occult blood; of these, 2,469 (73%) informed the center that they saw their physician to initiate a work-up.
 Information from physicians regarding work-ups was returned on only 1,356 (55%) patients.
 Diagnostic tests numbered 2,227 (1.6 tests per patient).
 However, 5% had no testing, 16% had a repeat Hemoccult only, and 35% had neither a barium enema nor colonoscopy performed.
 Thirty-six colorectal cancers and 212 polyps were identified.
 The predictive value (i.e., number of cancers per number of patients who tested positive) increased directly by decade.
 Thirty-three of 36 patients (92%) with cancer underwent either a barium enema or colonoscopy versus only 185 of 438 (42%) patients with a ""negative"" work-up.
 Cancers found were carcinoma in situ in 10 patients (29%), Dukes A in 12 (35%), Dukes B in 4 (12%), and Dukes C in 8 (24%); distant metastases were not found in any participant.
 Thirty-six percent of the tumors were located in either the right or transverse colon.
 We conclude that: (1) Screening identified early cancers.
 All were potentially curable and 64% were limited to the bowel wall.
 (2) Massive Hemoccult distribution was possible over a short interval, but patient and physician compliance was disturbingly low.
 (3) Total colonic evaluation is mandatory, since at least 36% of tumors were beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscope.
 (4) Many work-ups were unnecessary (repeat Hemoccults) or inadequate, indicating a need for physician education.

1638,"Myocardial imaging with Tc-99m teboroxime: technique and initial results.
 This study examined the results of Tc-99m teboroxime imaging in 22 patients aged 59 +/- 9 years and compared the results with those of thallium-201.
 The exercise and rest teboroxime studies were obtained within 3 hours of each other using a dose of 15 mCi/study.
 Because of the very short wash-out half-life of teboroxime, imaging was begun within 1 to 2 minutes after injection.
 Both SPECT and planar images were obtained; the SPECT protocol was modified by changing the number of frames, the time per frame, or the filters used for reconstruction of images.
 The planar images were obtained in the supine or upright position.
 Shorter acquisition time for SPECT (10 sec/frame) and the use of a Butterworth filter with a frequency cutoff of 0.3 cycle/cm and a power of 10 yielded best image quality.
 There was a close agreement with thallium results in identifying an abnormal or normal perfusion pattern in 89% of vascular territories.
 The scans were abnormal by both techniques in 12 patients, normal in nine patients, and discordant in only one patient.
 Thus Tc-99m teboroxime myocardial imaging is feasible at rest and during exercise using either SPECT or planar imaging.
 Shorter acquisition time and appropriate filtering for SPECT imaging and the upright position in planar imaging improve image quality and are convenient for the patient.

 Limitation of space and motion artefact make magnetic resonance imaging during dynamic exercise difficult.
 Pharmacological stress with dipyridamole can be used as an alternative to exercise for thallium scanning.
 Forty patients with a history of angina and an abnormal exercise electrocardiogram were studied by dipyridamole thallium myocardial perfusion tomography and dipyridamole magnetic resonance wall motion imaging with a cine gradient refocused sequence.
 Images for both scans were obtained in the oblique horizontal and vertical long axis and short axis planes before and after pharmacological stress with dipyridamole.
 The myocardium was divided into nine segments for direct comparison of perfusion with wall motion.
 Segments were assessed visually into grades--normal, hypokinesis or reduced perfusion, and akinesis or very reduced perfusion.
 After dipyridamole there were reversible wall motion abnormalities in 24 (62%) of 39 patients with coronary artery disease and 24 (67%) of 36 patients with reversible thallium defects.
 The site of wall motion deterioration was always the site of a reversible thallium defect.
 Thallium defects affecting more than two segments were always associated with wall motion deterioration but most single segment thallium defects were undetected by magnetic resonance imaging.
 There was a significant correlation between detection of wall motion abnormality, the angiographic severity of coronary artery disease, and the induction of chest pain by dipyridamole.
 There were no significant differences in ventricular volume or ejection fraction changes after dipyridamole between the groups with and without detectable reversible wall motion changes but the normalised magnetic resonance signal intensity of the abnormally moving segments was significantly less than the signal intensity of the normal segments.

 In 33 normal infants, divided into 3 age groups (less than 1 month, 1-3 months, and 3-6 months) plasma cortisol was measured at 2230, 2300, and 2330 h.
 Baseline plasma cortisol at 2230 h.
 was, as expected, low in all infants, with mean +/- SEM values of 41 +/- 5, 72 +/- 14, and 97 +/- 17 nmol/L in each group, respectively.
 Thirty and 60 min after the painful stimulus of the venipuncture, plasma cortisol increased significantly (P less than 0.0005), reaching a maximum increase up to 458 +/- 50, 392 +/- 66, and 455 +/- 97 nmol/L in each age group, respectively.
 We conclude that in these infants the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was functionally intact and responded to the painful stimulus of the venipuncture by a significant increase in plasma cortisol.
 This test may be used as a simple procedure for the evaluation of the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis without the administration of pharmacological agents.
 Its usefulness, however, should be validated with patients having a disorder of the system.

1641,"Rediscovering tactile agnosia.
 Eighty-four patients with damage to various levels of the nervous system, ranging from the peripheral nerves to the cerebral cortex, underwent somesthetic assessment in order to determine the degree to which basic and complex perceptual and motor disorders affect tactile object recognition (TOR) and to determine whether TOR can be impaired in the absence of more basic sensorimotor imperception.
 The results suggest that (1) basic and intermediate disorders of somesthetic function impair TOR but are commensurately more severe for any given degree of TOR impairment in patients with peripheral lesions than in patients with cortical lesions; (2) neither hemiparesis nor hemianopia alone precludes normal TOR; (3) hemineglect contributes substantially to TOR impairment; (4) impairment of TOR can occur in the absence of more basic somesthetic dysfunction and constitutes tactile agnosia; (5) tactile agnosia is a subtle, nondisabling disorder that should be distinguished from the nonagnosic, severe and disabling disorder, astereognosis; and (6) tactile agnosia results from unilateral damage to parietotemporal cortices, possibly including the second somatosensory cortex, in either hemisphere.

 The reliability of clinical examination of the tendon reflexes was examined by studying inter-observer agreement.
 Twenty patients were examined by three neurologists.
 The briskness of the tendon reflexes in arms and legs was scored on a nine-point scale.
 In 28% of the 160 examined reflexes the observations disagreed 2 scale units or more.
 Disagreement on the presence of asymmetry occurred in 45% of the 80 reflex pairs.
 In 15% one observer judged a reflex pair to be symmetrical while another observer found asymmetry of at least 2 scale units.
 In a second experiment clinical observation of apparently asymmetrical quadriceps reflexes was compared with measurement by surface electromyography.
 A significant, semi-logarithmic relationship was found between clinical scores and measured reflex amplitudes.
 Measured reflex asymmetry always agreed with clinical asymmetry, and the magnitudes of right-left amplitude differences were correlated with the magnitude of clinically observed asymmetry.
 The bedside examination of tendon reflexes is subject to considerable inter-observer disagreement.

1643,"Outcomes of direct coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction in candidates and non-candidates for thrombolytic therapy.
 Coronary angioplasty without prior thrombolytic therapy was performed in 383 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
 Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on whether they were candidates or non-candidates for thrombolytic therapy.
 Patients were not considered thrombolytic candidates if they: (1) presented in cardiogenic shock, (2) were greater than or equal to 75 years of age, (3) had had coronary artery bypass surgery or, (4) had a reperfusion time of greater than 6 hours.
 Thrombolytic and nonthrombolytic candidates had similar rates of reperfusion (92 vs 88%), nonfatal reinfarction (6.0 vs 5.9%) and recurrent myocardial ischemia (1.8 vs 0%).
 Thrombolytic candidates had a lower mortality rate (3.9 vs 24%, p less than 0.0001) and a lower incidence of bleeding (4.6 vs 10.9%, p less than 0.05).
 Improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction at follow-up angiography was 4.4% in thrombolytic and 10.5% in nonthrombolytic candidates (p less than 0.002).
 Ejection fraction improved most in patients with anterior wall AMI (7.7% in thrombolytic candidates, 15.1% in nonthrombolytic candidates) and in patients with reperfusion times greater than 6 hours (14.2%).
 These outcomes suggest that direct coronary angioplasty is a viable alternative method of reperfusion in patients with AMI who are candidates for thrombolytic therapy.
 Nonthrombolytic candidates are a high-risk group of patients.
 Direct coronary angioplasty may be beneficial in certain subgroups, especially for patients in cardiogenic shock and for patients presenting greater than 6 hours after the onset of chest pain with evidence of ongoing ischemia.

1644,"The pituitary-adrenocortical system of neonatal rats is responsive to stress throughout development in a time-dependent and stressor-specific fashion.
 The responsiveness of the neonatal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to stress has been thought to be impaired or diminished during the first 2 weeks of life.
 Although we previously found full responsiveness of the hypothalamus-pituitary unit to adrenalectomy in young rats [days (d) 5-10], we failed to measure a significant increase in ACTH 10 min after ether administration until d14 of age.
 These studies were, therefore, designed to test the functional activation of the HPA axis after a single or repeated exposures to stress.
 Both qualitative (time-course, stressor-specific, circadian) and quantitative changes in the ACTH and corticosterone (B) responses to various stressors were tested during the first 10 days of life.
 Exposure to 3 min of ether vapor increased ACTH and B secretion (P less than 0.05-0.01) in 1-, 5-, and 10-d-old rats, with an increasing amplitude of both ACTH and B responses as a function of age.
 Peak secretion of ACTH occurred 5 min after the onset of stress (122 +/- 3.8 to 359 +/- 54 pg/ml on d1-10), while the time of maximal B increased as a function of age.
 Other stressors, such as maternal separation (12 h), cold (4 C; 60 min), or histamine injection (4 mg/kg BW, ip), provoked significant and stressor-specific ACTH and B responses in 10-d old rats.
 Histamine administration increased ACTH secretion above that of vehicle-injected rats, with a peak of secretion 15 min after drug injection (272 +/- 29 vs.
 127 +/- 8 pg/ml; P less than 0.01).
 Histamine-induced B secretion peaked at 60 min (3.7 +/- 0.5 micrograms/dl).
 In contrast to early responses observed after ether, separation, or histamine stress, cold stress in 10-d-old pups caused a large ACTH and B release 4 h after the onset of cold compared to that in maternally deprived pups [ACTH: cold, 457 +/- 61 pg/ml; separated, 150 +/- 14 (P less than 0.01); B: cold, 3.3 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl; separated, 1.8 +/- 0.2 (P less than 0.05)].
 We did not detect morning-evening (AM-PM) differences in either the pattern or the magnitude of the ACTH or B response to maternal separation or cold stress.
 Suppression of cold-induced ACTH release by B injection (1 mg/kg BW) 2 h before stress was observed until 4 h after stress in the AM and PM, whereas when given after cold, B was less effective in the PM than in the AM at preventing the rise in ACTH levels observed at 4 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

 The authors describe a two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiography technique to create projection venograms of the head.
 The technique was applied to 27 healthy volunteers and 39 patients.
 The superior sagittal and straight sinuses, the internal cerebral veins, and the Galen vein were visualized in all the volunteers.
 Other veins were seen in a high percentage of subjects.
 Systematic comparison of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) after intraarterial contrast medium injection and MR venography in patients showed good correlation between the two techniques.
 MR venography proved helpful in identifying thrombosis or patency of cerebral veins and sinuses and showed collateral venous drainage and venous drainage from arteriovenous malformations.
 There was good correlation between conventional contrast angiography and MR venography.
 In conclusion, MR venography is considered reliable for showing the cerebral venous system and provides information additional to that of conventional spin-echo imaging.

 No change in heart rate was recorded and no patients had side effects.
 The serum lipid profile was modified favorably, particularly with regard to the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio.
 By producing a reduction in blood pressure and left ventricular mass while favorably modifying the serum lipid profile, doxazosin produced a beneficial change in the overall coronary heart disease risk profile.

 The changes in total pressure-length loop area were compared with changes in effective shortening area, systolic lengthening area and postsystolic shortening area (defined with respect to end-diastolic and end-systolic lengths) of the pressure-length loop during myocardial ischemia in seven anesthetized dogs instrumented for measurement of left ventricular pressure and regional segmental wall motion (sonomicrometry) in the minor axis of the apical region of the left ventricle.
 Ischemia was induced by gradual tightening of a micrometer-controlled snare around the left anterior descending coronary artery, which supplied the apical myocardium.
 Data were obtained at normal flow, after critical constriction (loss of pulsatile coronary flow), mild ischemia (ischemia 1: onset of regional dysfunction, i.e., postsystolic shortening and mild hypokinesia) and moderate ischemia (ischemia 2: marked hypokinesia).
 At each stage, acute afterloading was performed by partially occluding the descending thoracic aorta.
 The pressure-length loops were analyzed in terms of four areas: total loop area, effective shortening area, postsystolic shortening area and systolic lengthening area.
 Total loop area decreased only when marked hypokinesia was present (176 +/- 18.3 mm Hg x mm at ischemia 2 versus 245.1 +/- 26.9 mm Hg x mm at ischemia 1, p less than 0.05).

 The phospholipase inhibitor mepacrine has been shown to delay cell death of metabolically inhibited cultured cardiomyocytes.
 The present study was initiated to determine if mepacrine also delays cell death and development of osmotic fragility of both metabolically inhibited and ischemic adult rat cardiomyocytes.
 Isolated myocyte suspensions were incubated with 3 mmol/l (millimolar) iodoacetic acid and 6 mmol/l amytal (inhibited) or were pelleted into a slurry and layered with oil (ischemic) in the presence and absence of 10 or 50 mumol/l (micromolar) mepacrine.
 Rates of contracture, cell viability as determined by trypan blue permeability, cell viability after osmotic swelling in 170 mOsm media (osmotic fragility), and cell morphology were monitored.
 Mepacrine had no effects on rates of contracture, but was found to significantly delay cell death during isotonic incubations of both metabolically inhibited and ischemic cells.
 In contrast, mepacrine had no effect on the development of osmotic fragility.
 Incubation of metabolically inhibited myocytes in calcium-free media did not delay contracture or cell injury, but did attenuate the protective effects of mepacrine.
 This study confirms previous reports that mepacrine protects cells from injury, extends the observations of protection to ischemic isolated adult myocytes, but shows that development of osmotic fragility is not inhibited by mepacrine.

 We investigated the effect of mild (34 degrees C) postischemic hypothermia on hippocampal neuronal damage in 43 rats as a function of the duration of forebrain ischemia.

 In two hypothermic groups ischemia lasted 8 (n = 9) and 12 (n = 9) minutes, respectively, and was followed immediately by the lowering and maintenance of rectal temperature to 34 degrees C for 2 hours.
 Seven days after the ischemic insult, the rats were sacrificed and the brains were prepared for histologic analysis; the percentage of necrotic neurons among the total neuronal population in selected CA1/2 sectors of the hippocampus was determined.

1652,"Selective inhibition by a synthetic hirudin peptide of fibrin-dependent thrombosis in baboons.
 To determine the importance of the thrombin substrate recognition exosite for fibrinogen binding in the formation of both arterial and venous thrombi, we evaluated the antithrombotic effects of the tyrosine-sulfated dodecapeptide from residues 53-64 of hirudin (H peptide) in a nonhuman primate model.
 This peptide was studied because it inhibits thrombin cleavages of fibrinogen by simple competition without blocking enzyme catalytic-site function.
 When an exteriorized arteriovenous access shunt model was used in baboons (Papio anubis), thrombus formation was induced by placing a thrombogenic device made of (i) a segment of tubing coated covalently with type I collagen, which generated platelet-rich thrombi under arterial flow conditions, and (ii) two subsequent annular regions of flow expansion that produced fibrin-rich thrombi typically associated with venous valves and veins.
 Thrombus formation was quantified by measurements of 111In-labeled platelet and 125I-labeled fibrinogen deposition in both arterial-flow and venous-flow portions of the device.
 Continuous infusion of H peptide (0.5, 15, and 75 mg/kg) proximal to the device for 40 min interrupted, in a dose-response fashion, formation of fibrin-rich thrombus in the regions of disturbed flow and generation of fibrinopeptide A.
 In contrast, H peptide did not inhibit the capacity of platelets to deposit on the collagen surface (P greater than 0.2 at all doses) or to form hemostatic plugs (as assessed by measurements of bleeding time; P greater than 0.1 at all doses).
 These findings suggest that, by competitive inhibition of fibrinogen binding to thrombin, fibrin-rich venous-type thrombus formation may be selectively prevented.
 This strategy may be therapeutically attractive for preserving normal platelet function when conventional anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated.

 The mass of LCAT secreted, determined by immunoassay, did not differ in the native and mutant species.
 LCAT specific activity was also unchanged in the mutant species.
 In particular, the cysteine-free double mutant, in which Cys-31 and Cys-184 had both been replaced, was fully active in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters.
 This result is not consistent with a catalytic role for LCAT free cysteine residues.
 The classical inhibitor of LCAT activity, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), which strongly (89%) inhibited the native enzyme, had partial (45%) inhibitory activity with mutant enzyme species containing a single -SH residue, while the double mutant was not significantly inhibited by DTNB.
 These data are interpreted to suggest that Cys-31 and Cys-184 are vicinal both to each other and to the ""interfacial binding site"" at residues 177-182, and that DTNB exerts its effect by steric inhibition.

 We have attempted to replicate the results of studies on a diagnostic test reported to have 90% sensitivity and 89-96% specificity for migraine.
 The technique is based on peak-to-peak measurements of fast background electroencephalographic activity during a visual evoked potential (VEP) study.
 VEP latencies and amplitudes did not differ significantly, and showed substantial overlap, between a group of eight migraine patients and ten age-matched healthy controls.
 We could not recognise previously described fast activity or measure it objectively by peak-to-peak measurements.
 We cannot confirm that measurement of fast wave activity in the VEP background is useful in diagnosis of migraine.

1659,"Prediction of risk in noncardiac operations after cardiac operations.
 To determine the preoperative variables affecting the mortality rate and the development of severe complications in patients who have had myocardial revascularization or a valve replacement and who then undergo a noncardiac operation, we retrospectively studied data from 120 such patients over the 5 years from 1982 through 1986.
 Thirty-six percent of patients had a noncardiac operation during the first month after the cardiac operation.
 The mortality rate was 11%, and the morbidity rate was 56%.
 The statistical comparison of the predictive accuracy of postoperative complications of three simple, widely used classifications (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, New York Heart Association classification, Massachusetts General Hospital cardiac risk index) demonstrated the superiority of the simplified three-class cardiac risk index (Massachusetts General Hospital-cardiac risk index; predictive accuracy of 84%).
 In a multivariate discriminant analysis of 21 variables in this population, five variables (myocardial infarction in previous 6 months, S3 gallop or jugular vein distention, arrhythmia on last preoperative electrocardiogram, emergency operation, delay between cardiac and noncardiac operation) were identified as being the most predictive of a postoperative complication.
 When these variables were used in the function (DF3) obtained by linear discriminant analysis, the prediction accuracy of a postoperative complication reached 83%.
 Performance of the new models in a prospective validation population remained satisfactory (75% for Massachusetts General Hospital-cardiac risk index three-class index and 72% for DF3).
 Extensive statistical analysis of our data tested by a validation study provided simple predictive models based on clinical variables easily available even in emergency situations.

1660,"Widespread functional effects of discrete thalamic infarction.
 In order to investigate functional effects of various thalamic structures on metabolism in remote, morphologically intact cerebral regions, we used positron emission tomography of (18F)-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to study regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (rCMRGlu) in 11 patients with chronic unilateral or bilateral infarcts strictly confined to the thalamus.
 Patients were grouped according to computed tomographic scans showing anterior (three), medial (four), or posterior (four) lesions.
 Compared with a matched group of 11 healthy subjects (hemispheric CMRGlu 35.2 +/- 3.49 mumol/100 g per minute), glucose metabolism was significantly lower in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the infarction (31.2 +/- 2.97 mumol/100 g per minute).
 Patients with bilateral infarcts had lower hemispheric CMRGlu (29.9 +/- 2.74 mumol/100 g per minute) than those with unilateral lesions (32.2 +/- 2.97 mumol/100 g per minute).
 Depending on infarct location within the thalamus, there was differential depression of rCMRGlu, with the largest effects on frontal and occipital areas in medial infarctions.
 Except for ipsilateral thalamic deactivation, metabolic patterns with anterior thalamic infarcts were close to normal, while posterior infarcts mostly depressed rCMRGlu in the visual and in the inferior limbic cortex.
 Cerebellar metabolic rates were within normal limits in most cases.
 These patterns of regional cerebral deactivation may be related to categories of thalamic projections--intrathalamic, to limbic system and basal ganglia, diffuse to most cortical areas, and specific to defined neocortical areas.
 Even small brain lesions may have widespread functional sequelae, potentially demonstrable by positron emission tomography.

1661,"Stimulation of cAMP and phosphomonoester production by melanotropin in melanoma cells: 31P NMR studies.
 A major part of the present understanding of the molecular basis of signal transduction has been gained from in vitro studies using classical biochemical methods.
 In this study, we used 31P NMR spectroscopy to investigate the response of live M2R mouse melanoma cells to stimulation by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH; melanotropin).
 In the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and a synergistic dose of forskolin (1.67 microM), MSH induced a transient (approximately 60-min) rise in the cellular concentration of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which coincided in time with an equivalent decrease (approximately 40%) in ATP.
 However, no detectable change in phosphocreatine concentration was observed.
 Concomitantly, MSH induced a striking and unexpected increase in the concentration of three phosphomonoester (PME) metabolites (approximately 2-fold increase in total PME signal area); one signal has been assigned to phosphoethanolamine.
 The levels of the PMEs remained high for 2-4 hr and declined slowly (approximately 10 hr) to basal level, following perfusion with fresh culture medium.
 The increase in PME was also observed after stimulation with MSH alone.
 In contrast, stimulation with a high dose of forskolin (50 microM) and isobutylmethylxanthine (0.2 mM), although effective in stimulating the production of cAMP, did not induce the PME response.
 Evaluation of the cells' energetics indicated that the enhanced production of phosphoethanolamine is probably not due to ethanolamine phosphorylation.
 Therefore, it is likely to result from hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine by a specific phospholipase C.
 The response of the PMEs appears to be regulated by a cAMP-independent process, suggesting the existence of an alternative transduction pathway controlled by MSH.

1662,"Preventing stroke by the modification of risk factors.
 Epidemiologic research has revealed the major risk factors in cerebrovascular disease.
 This review will concentrate on three important risk factors: elevated blood pressure, the most common and important, since it is responsible for up to 70% of all strokes; raised cholesterol; and smoking.
 These factors are important not only because they increase the risk of stroke, but also because they are amenable to modification by drugs, diet, or other interventions.
 Strategies to avoid stroke can either 1) try to produce substantial reductions, usually with drugs, in the level of the risk factor in the few individuals in the population with high levels (the ""high-risk"" approach), or 2) try to produce modest reductions in the level of the risk factor in every individual in the population, usually not with drugs but with lifestyle modification (the ""mass"" approach).
 The prevention of stroke could best be achieved through continuing medical efforts to deal with high-risk individuals and through political strategies to encourage a healthier lifestyle in the population as a whole.

 We assessed the potential of 2-MHz pulsed-wave transorbital Doppler ultrasonography to delineate the role of the ophthalmic artery as a source of collateral cerebral blood supply by comparing oculopneumoplethysmography, transorbital Doppler ultrasonography, periorbital continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in 25 patients with unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion and five controls with 10 normal internal carotid arteries.
 Systolic ophthalmic artery blood velocity was reduced ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion (38.2 +/- 10.2 cm/sec) compared with the contralateral and control velocities (46.0 +/- 10.3 and 47.5 +/- 6.8 cm/sec, respectively; p less than 0.05).
 Ophthalmic systolic pressure measured by oculopneumoplethysmography was 94.7 +/- 13.2 mm Hg ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion compared with 108.4 +/- 15.3 mm Hg on the contralateral side (p less than 0.01).
 Transorbital and periorbital Doppler ultrasonography detected reversed ophthalmic artery blood flow ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion in 44.0% and 40.0% of the patients, respectively.
 Systolic middle cerebral artery blood velocity was 55.2 +/- 22.3 cm/sec ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion compared with 79.4 +/- 23.5 cm/sec on the contralateral side (p less than 0.05) and 101.2 +/- 18.9 cm/sec in the controls (p less than 0.05).
 Reversed ophthalmic artery blood flow was associated with a low middle cerebral artery blood velocity and lack of major intracerebral collaterals.

 Major complications associated with funipuncture have been reported but are rare.
 This is a report of a diagnostic funipuncture performed on a 29-week fetus with a single umbilical artery and multiple malformations.
 Immediately after the procedure, a voluminous hematoma developed at the site of needle insertion in association with a severe fetal bradycardia.
 Fetal death was confirmed within 5 minutes of needle insertion.
 It is hypothesized that the risk of complications of funipuncture may vary according to the clinical indication for the procedure and may be increased in the presence of certain fetal malformations.
 The rapid evolution of complications, as occurred in the present case, underlines the importance of having a clear plan of management in the event of mishap and discussing this plan with the parents before undertaking diagnostic funipuncture.

1665,"Retinoid modulation of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins and inhibition of breast carcinoma proliferation.
 Retinoids induce cellular differentiation and inhibit cellular proliferation.
 Proliferation of human breast carcinoma cells in vitro is markedly inhibited by these compounds.
 On the other hand, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their receptors seem to be involved in the growth of certain breast carcinoma cells by autocrine or paracrine effects.
 Since the effects of both IGF-I and IGF-II may be modulated by specific binding proteins (IGF-BPs) we examined the possibility that one mechanism by which retinoic acid may inhibit cancer growth is by an alteration in these BPs, thereby blocking IGF's growth effect.
 Retinoic acid (RA; 1 microM) completely blocked the effect of IGF-I (50 ng/ml) on enhancing proliferation of MCF-7 cells in culture.
 This effect of RA was not associated with any significant change in specific IGF-I-binding sites on these cells.
 RA induced a 3-fold increase in IGF-binding activity in conditioned medium, measured using a polyethylene glycol-immunoglobulin precipitation assay and a charcoal absorption assay.
 This increase was associated with the appearance of 42- and 46-kDa IGF-BPs on ligand blotting.
 The effect of RA on these IGF-BPs was time and concentration dependent.
 In contrast, during some experiments the 27- and 36-kDa BPs actually decreased.
 These findings support the hypothesis that RA may inhibit the growth of certain breast carcinoma cells by increasing the secretion of certain IGF-BPs, which could directly modulate the growth effect of IGFs.

1667,"The lovastatin-treated rodent: a new model of barrier disruption and epidermal hyperplasia.
 Recent studies have linked epidermal cholesterol synthesis with maintenance of the permeability barrier.
 To assess directly the importance of cholesterol synthesis, we applied lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, to hairless mouse skin.
 Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) began to increase after four to six daily applications.
 Co-application of cholesterol blocked the expected increase in TEWL, demonstrating the importance of cholesterol for development of the lesion.
 The histology of lovastatin-treated skin revealed epidermal hyperplasia, accompanied by accelerated DNA synthesis.
 Whereas cholesterol synthesis initially was reduced in lovastatin-treated epidermis, with further treatment cholesterol synthesis normalized, while fatty acid synthesis accelerated greatly.
 Although the total free sterol content of lovastatin-treated epidermis remained normal, the fatty acid content increased coincident with barrier disruption.
 Finally, morphologic abnormalities of both lamellar body structure and their deposited, intercellular contents occurred coincident with the emerging biochemical abnormalities.
 Thus, the abnormal barrier function in this model can be ascribed to an initial inhibition of epidermal sterol synthesis followed by an alteration in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, leading to an imbalance in stratum corneum lipid composition and abnormal membrane bilayer structure.

 One hundred eight-five patients with acral melanoma treated since 1972 were reviewed.
 These included 53 subungual lesions, 123 plantar lesions, and 9 palmar lesions.
 Eighty percent presented with stage I disease.
 Mean age was 57 years.
 Males outnumbered females 1.1:1.
 Seventeen percent (17%) were blacks.
 Actuarial 10-year survival was 58% for stage I patients and 35% for stage II patients.
 Univariate Cox regression analyses identified 5 prognostic variables affecting survival: stage at diagnosis (P less than 0.001), race (P less than 0.001), ulceration (P = 0.012), Clark's level (P = 0.014), and thickness of the primary lesion (P = 0.013).
 Factors unrelated to survival included sex of the patient, site (volar vs.
 subungual), histology, and treatment with amputation.
 Multivariate analysis for patients with stage I lesions identified race (P = 0.001) and ulceration (P = 0.018) as significant variables, with thickness approaching significance (P = 0.094).
 In an additional series of 71 patients with melanomas arising from extremity sites near the junction of glabrous and non-glabrous skin, survival was significantly poorer for those arising from glabrous skin (P = 0.024), and reflects a higher incidence of metastatic disease at diagnosis.
 Specific active immunotherapy was the principal adjuvant used for these patients, and survival was comparable to that reported with regional perfusion therapy.
 Acral melanoma a) has a strong racial predilection, b) carries a grave prognosis, and c) arises from glabrous skin.
 It is a clinical entity distinct from other extremity melanomas.
 Surgical management with either wide excision or amputation is appropriate for the primary lesion.

 The prognostic significance of S-phase fraction analyses of breast carcinomas has been reported by several investigators.
 The Cell Proliferation Kit (Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL), which uses in vitro bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) labeling to evaluate cell cycle kinetics without a flow cytometer or radioisotopes, simplifies this assay for the clinical-based laboratory by providing standardized reagents and recommended methods.
 This study was performed to determine whether data derived from its use were comparable to published S-phase data from the use of thymidine labeling, BRDU, or other methods on breast carcinomas.
 Primary infiltrating ductal carcinomas (n = 142) and primary lobular carcinomas (n = 6) showed mean and median BRDU labeling of 4.63% and 3%, 1.3% and 1%, respectively, with a range of 0-28%.
 Benign lesions always had less than 3% BRDU uptake (n = 21).
 Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status correlated with BRDU labeling (P less than 0.05), with the highest S-phase fractions in ER- and PR-negative tumors.
 Correlations between BRDU uptake and histologic tumor type or size were observed.
 Significant correlations between BRDU uptake and lymph node status, patient age, or histologic tumor grade were not observed.
 S-phase studies of breast carcinomas using other techniques have shown similar data, therefore, the Cell Proliferation Kit appears to be a practical and useful method for in vitro S-phase analysis that allows concomitant histologic examination of the same tumor tissue sample.

 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are now firmly established in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).
 Their beneficial acute and chronic hemodynamic effects are not associated with reflex tachycardia or drug tolerance.
 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors produce symptomatic improvement and improve exercise capacity in all grades of heart failure.
 They also improve the prognosis of patients with severe heart failure.
 Quinapril is a recently introduced, nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, whose intermediate half-life makes it well-suited for the treatment of patients with CHF.
 The acute and chronic hemodynamic effects of quinapril are similar to those of other ACE inhibitors.
 In a large, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 225 patients with mild to moderate CHF, 10 to 40 mg/day quinapril significantly improved clinical status and exercise capacity in a dose-related manner.
 The incidence of side effects did not differ significantly from that of placebo.
 The initial studies with quinapril are promising and warrant further clinical investigation of this compound.

 Recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) influence the rate of extracellular matrix formed in treated incisional wounds.
 Because incisional healing processes are difficult to quantify, a full-thickness excisional wound model in the rabbit ear was developed to permit detailed analyses of growth-factor-mediated tissue repair.
 In the present studies, quantitative and qualitative differences in acute inflammatory cell influx, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) deposition, collagen formation, and myofibroblast generation in PDGF-BB (BB homodimer)- and TGF-beta 1-treated wounds were detected when analyzed histochemically and ultrastructurally.
 Although both growth factors significantly augmented extracellular matrix formation and healing in 10-day wounds compared with controls (P less than 0.002).
 PDGF-BB markedly increased macrophage influx and GAG deposition, whereas TGF-beta 1 selectively induced significantly more mature collagen bundles at the leading edge of new granulation tissue (P = 0.007).
 Transforming growth factor-beta 1-treated wound fibroblasts demonstrated active collagen fibrillogenesis and accretion of subfibrils at the ultrastructural level.
 Myofibroblasts, phenotypically modified fibroblasts considered responsible for wound contraction, were observed in control, but were absent in early growth-factor-treated granulating wounds.
 These results provide important insights into the mechanisms of soft tissue repair and indicate that 1) PDGF-BB induces an inflammatory response and provisional matrix synthesis within wounds that is qualitatively similar but quantitatively increased compared with normal wounds; 2) TGF-beta 1 preferentially triggers synthesis and more rapid maturation of collagen within early wounds; and 3) both growth factors inhibit the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, perhaps because wound contraction is not required, due to increased extracellular matrix synthesis.

 We measured the effects of left ventricular circulatory assistance on ventricular mechanics of ejecting sheep hearts before and after global ischemia.
 Flows from left atrium to femoral artery ranged between 20 and 100 ml/kg/min during circulatory assistance.
 In preischemic, ejecting hearts increasing flow through the left ventricular assist device progressively decreased stroke volume, end-diastolic volume, and circumferential systolic wall stress, but only slightly decreased end-systolic volume.
 In postischemic, ejecting hearts left ventricular assistance progressively and substantially decreased both end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume; at high flows, end-systolic volume returned to the normal range of preischemic hearts.
 High flows through the assist device also shifted end-systolic points of pressure-volume loops leftward and increased the stroke work/end-diastolic volume ratio in ejecting postischemic hearts; these observations raise the possibility that left ventricular circulatory assistance acutely improves myocardial contractility of postischemic hearts.

 Aspirates were interpreted as benign, suspicious, malignant, or unsatisfactory.
 Malignant disease was the final diagnosis in 109 patients; the cytology was concordant in 101 and was interpreted as suspicious in four.
 Four patients with benign cytology later proved to have malignant disease--a false-negative rate of 2.5 per cent.
 A total of 57 patients had benign disease; 51 of these had benign cytology.

 The authors investigated the humoral and tissue expression of six antigens associated with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC): calcitonin (CT), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), somatostatin (SRIF), and thyroglobulin (TG).
 The antigens were studied in the neoplastic C cells using immunohistochemistry with specific antisera and in the plasma using specific radioimmunoassay.
 Eighteen patients (8 male and 10 female patients, aged 12-72 years) were studied.
 Mean follow-up was 70.7 months (range, 2-179 months).
 Nine patients (50%) died of their disease after a mean follow-up of 47.2 months (range, 2-116 months).
 By immunostaining, primary tumors expressed CT and CEA in all cases and NSE was positive in 90%, CGRP in 66%, SRIF in 63%, and TG in 58%.
 Metastatic tissues were positive in all cases of CT staining, 92.8% of CEA, 71.4% of NSE, 73.3% of CGRP, 38.5% of SRIF, and only 13.3% of TG staining.
 In positive cases the percentage of positive cells and the degree of staining were variable among the different antigens.
 The expression of an antigen in the neoplastic cells was associated with the hypersecretion of the corresponding antigen in the circulation in the case of CT and CEA.
 The levels of these antigens were elevated in all patients with metastases and could accurately predict the appearance of new metastases or indicate the effective treatment of previous metastases by surgery.
 In the case of NSE, CGRP, and SRIF, few patients had increased plasma concentrations of the antigens and these usually occurred during very advanced phases of the disease.
 Detectable levels of serum TG were never observed.
 When the outcome of the disease was compared with the expression of CT, CEA, NSE, CGRP, and TG, no correlation could be found.
 On the contrary, SRIF expression in the primary tumor could differentiate two groups of patients with different survival rates.
 SRIF-positive patients had survival rates of 100% and 50% at five and seven years, respectively, whereas SRIF-negative patients had survival rates of 40% at five years and 25% at seven years.

1677,"Predicting the appropriate use of carotid endarterectomy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and coronary angiography 
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS.
 In a nationally representative population 65 years of age or older, we have demonstrated that about one quarter of coronary angiographies and upper gastrointestinal endoscopies and two thirds of carotid endarterectomies were performed for reasons that were less than medically appropriate.
 In this paper we examine whether specific characteristics of patients (age, sex, and race), physicians (age, board-certification status, and experience with the procedure), or hospitals (teaching status, profit-making status, and size) predict whether a procedure will be performed appropriately.
 RESULTS.
 In general, we found that little of the variability in the appropriateness of care (4 percent or less) could be explained on the basis of standard, easily obtainable data about the patient, the physician, or the hospital.
 For all three procedures, however, performance in a teaching hospital increased the likelihood that the reasons would be medically appropriate (P = 0.09 for angiography, P = 0.30 for endoscopy, and P less than 0.01 for endarterectomy).
 In addition, angiographies were more often performed for appropriate reasons in older or more affluent patients (P less than 0.01 for both).
 Being treated by a surgeon who performed a high rather than a low number of procedures decreased the likelihood of an appropriate endarterectomy by one third, from 40 to 28 percent (P less than 0.01).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Appropriateness of care cannot be closely predicted from many easily determined characteristics of patients, physicians, or hospitals.
 Thus, for the present, if appropriateness is to be improved it will have to be assessed directly at the level of each patient, hospital, and physician.

 Thirty anesthetized cats were randomly assigned to one of three groups of 10 cats each: nimodipine treatment, nimodipine treatment combined with induced hypertension, or a control group.
 The behavior of the cerebral pial arteries was measured by means of microscopic observation through a cranial window.
 The middle cerebral artery of each cat was clipped for 1 hour via the transorbital approach.
 Five hours after circulation was reestablished in the middle cerebral artery, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously: 30 minutes later, the animal was killed.
 Administration of nimodipine or saline in the treated or control group was started 5 minutes before the middle cerebral artery was clipped and maintained until the end of the experiment.
 Induced hypertension was produced by administration of dopamine during the occlusion.

 On the other hand, the extravasation of Evans blue dye and cerebral edema were significantly more extensive in the group treated with nimodipine and induced hypertension (extravasation, 28.2 +/- 9.6% of the hemisphere; edema, 30.3 +/- 7.1%) than in the group treated with nimodipine alone (extravasation, 18.5 +/- 8.7% of the hemisphere; edema, 19.4 +/- 6.3%), but the infarction size was similar in both groups (16.6 +/- 4.9% of the hemisphere in the former; 17.0 +/- 6.2 in the latter).

1683,"Surgical procedures in the management of Takayasu's arteritis.
 Takayasu's arteritis is an inflammatory arteriopathy that often progresses to obliteration of multiple large arteries.
 Variable results have been reported after medical and surgical management.
 Twenty female patients with Takayasu's arteritis were treated from 1973 to 1989.
 Eleven (55%) patients had hypertension.
 Upper or lower extremity ischemia was present in 12 (60%) patients and cerebrovascular insufficiency in seven (35%).
 Nine patients initially managed with corticosteroids had no improvement in signs or symptoms of arterial insufficiency.
 Eleven patients had 16 vascular procedures for the following indications: renovascular hypertension (6), extremity ischemia (5), cerebrovascular insufficiency (2), dilation ascending aorta with aortic insufficiency (1), thoracic aortic aneurysm (1), abdominal aortic aneurysm (1).
 Procedures included aortorenal bypass (5), carotid-subclavian, axillary, or brachial bypass (4), aorto-carotid bypass (2), aneurysm resection (2), supra-celiac aorto-femoral bypass (1), ascending aorta/aortic valve replacement (1), and nephrectomy (1).
 Clinical improvement occurred in all patients.
 There were no operative deaths.
 All are alive at a mean follow-up of 5.75 years (6 months to 16 years).
 Revision of the initial reconstruction has been required for recurrent renovascular hypertension in one patient and extremity ischemia in another.
 The other nine patients remain symptomatically improved.
 Symptomatic Takayasu's arteritis frequently requires arterial reconstruction.
 Symptomatic improvement and excellent long-term graft patency can be expected after arterial reconstruction.

 A 26-year-old woman with a congenital port-wine stain on the forehead was treated three times at 2-month intervals with an argon laser.
 Six months after the last treatment, moderate blanching and mild scaling confined to the treated area was observed.
 A biopsy specimen of the treated area revealed a significant decrease in ectatic vessels.
 However, epidermal changes similar to those of actinic keratosis with disorganized cell layers and marked cytologic abnormalities were seen.
 Analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes for a defect in DNA repair was negative.
 Multiple, argon laser-induced photothermal effects may be responsible for the changes observed in our case and may lead to premalignant epidermal transformation.

 The study was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of doxazosin in the control of blood pressure in general medical practice; the results presented concern the first 748 patients evaluated over a 12-week period.
 Blood pressure was significantly reduced after treatment with doxazosin (-13/-9 mm Hg), and heart rate was not significantly altered.
 In addition, doxazosin significantly reduced total cholesterol levels (-6.7%), reduced triglyceride levels (-19.8%), increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (+2.5%), and the high-density lipoprotein:total cholesterol ratio (+9.7%).
 The calculated risk of coronary heart disease was reduced by 20.5% over a 12-week period.
 Thirty-five percent of patients reported at least one side effect, and the number of patients experiencing severe adverse reactions was small.
 Twenty patients (2.7%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events, and 2.7% had the dose of doxazosin reduced.

 Regurgitant jet dimensions imaged by color Doppler flow mapping have been used to evaluate the severity of valvular insufficiency in clinical studies.
 To study the effect of pressure and volume within the receiving chamber on the magnitude of spatial distribution of regurgitant jets assessed by color Doppler techniques, we designed a simple constant-flow model in which a jet was driven through a known orifice (1.5 mm2) into a compliant receiving chamber by a steady-flow pump.
 A distal tube at the outflow closed the system and maintained the volume of the chamber constant during pump operation.
 We varied flow rate from 60 to 270 ml/min into elastic balloons with different static compliances of 1, 2, 4.5, and 9 ml/mm Hg (pressures of 57, 28, 18, and 8 mm Hg, respectively); the balloons served as receiving chambers at the constant volume of 150 ml.
 We also evaluated the effect of different volumes of a receiving chamber (110, 130, and 150 ml and pressures of 5, 15, and 24 mm Hg) with a static compliance of 2 ml/mm Hg over the same range of flow rates.
 For each of the different balloons, jet area correlated linearly with the jet velocity across the orifice (r = 0.98, 0.99, 0.98, and 0.97) and also with flow rate (r = 0.97, 0.99, 0.98, and 0.99).
 At the same flow rate and volume of receiving chamber, however, the jet area imaged by color Doppler decreased as the pressure in the receiving chamber increased, although receiving-chamber volume was constant.

1687,"Left ventricular size, mass and function in relation to the duration and quantity of heavy drinking in alcoholics.
 Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and mild dysfunction are frequently observed in alcoholics but little is known about how they relate to the duration and severity of alcohol abuse.
 LV size, mass and function were studied using echocardiography and systolic time intervals in 78 middle-aged male alcoholics who also gave detailed accounts of the duration of heavy drinking, the quantity of recent ethanol consumption and the duration of abstinence.
 Compared with 34 healthy nonalcoholics, alcoholics had a higher LV mass index (85 +/- 2 [mean +/- standard error] vs 77 +/- 2 g/m2, p = 0.001), a thicker posterior wall (11 +/- 0.2 vs 10 +/- 0.2 mm, p = 0.02), a longer end-systolic diameter index (18 +/- 0.3 vs 17 +/- 0.3 mm/m2, p = 0.02), and a higher preejection period/ejection time ratio (0.36 +/- 0.01 vs 0.33 +/- 0.01, p = 0.002).
 In multivariate linear regression models, these abnormalities proved independent of the drinking history, except that posterior wall thickness was weakly related to the duration of heavy drinking (standardized correlation coefficient 0.36, p = 0.01).
 Univariate analyses suggested that the LV mass index and systolic time interval ratio had, if anything, a curvilinear relation to the total duration of heavy alcohol consumption.
 It is concluded that the LV hypertrophy and dysfunction found in alcoholics are poorly related to the duration and severity of self-reported alcohol abuse.
 Together with other data, this suggests that there is no simple linear dose-injury relation in the long-term cardiotoxicity of ethanol.
 Factors modifying the myocardial effects of ethanol need to be studies more in the future.

1688,"Anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Evaluation, arthroscopic reconstruction, and rehabilitation.
 The advantages of arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament tear over arthrotomy are quite obvious: reduced pain and morbidity.
 Some arthroscopists are performing these procedures on an outpatient basis.
 The physician can choose from several graft substitutes for anterior cruciate ligament replacement.
 Autografts consisting of the iliotibial band, semitendinosus, gracilis, and meniscus have been used as grafts.
 The most common autograft is the bone-patellar tendon-bone, which has been used since 1930 and has been shown to have a tensile strength near that of the anterior cruciate ligament.
 The state of the art in surgical alternatives for anterior cruciate ligament tears is arthroscopic reconstruction using the midthird of the patellar tendon.
 Treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries requires prompt and adequate evaluation of the laxity of the ligament as well as other structures in the knee, appropriate treatment options offered to the patient with complete descriptions of knee function after each treatment option, and comprehensive rehabilitation program.
 Patient compliance is an integral part of the success of this procedure.
 The nurse must include a description of the injury, preoperative testing, surgical intervention, and rehabilitation program when educating the patient.
 The successful postoperative anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation program is multifaceted.
 In general, there must be specific guidelines applied by a physical therapist who has knowledge of the surgical procedure, understands principles of ligament healing, and has the ability to individualize the program as needed.
 For any level of athlete or active person, there must be achievement of all goals per phase to a high performance level.
 In addition, there must always be objective measurements to document progress to the physical therapist and physician but, perhaps most importantly, to reassure the patient that normalcy is being restored.

1689,"A variant of arteriovenous fistulas within the wall of dural sinuses. Results of combined surgical and endovascular therapy.
 Dural arteriovenous (AV) fistulas are thought to be acquired lesions that form in an area of thrombosis within a sinus.
 If the sinus remains completely thrombosed, venous drainage from these lesions occurs through cortical veins, or, if the sinus is open, venous drainage is usually into the involved sinus.
 Among 105 patients with dural AV fistulas evaluated over the the past 5 years, seven had a unique type of dural AV fistula in the superior sagittal, transverse, or straight sinus in which only cortical venous drainage occurred despite a patent involved sinus; the fistula was located within the wall of a patent dural sinus, but outflow was not into the involved sinus.
 This variant of dural AV fistulas puts the patient at serious risk for hemorrhage or neurological dysfunction caused by venous hypertension.
 Three patients presented with hemorrhage, one with progressive neurological dysfunction, one with seizures, and two with bruit and headaches.
 A combination of surgical and endovascular techniques was used to close the fistula while preserving flow through the sinus.

 We studied the impairment of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its effect on the electrical activity of the brain during the development of chronic cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, using a vasospasm model in primates.
 Fourteen animals were divided into two groups: a clot group (8) and a sham-operated group (6).
 To induce subarachnoid hemorrhage, all the animals underwent craniectomy, and in the clot group, the autologous blood clot was located around the arteries dissected free from the arachnoid membrane.
 Cerebral angiography was performed before subarachnoid hemorrhage and 7 days after (Day 7).
 On Day 7, regional CBF in the parietal lobe--measured by the hydrogen clearance method--and central conduction time were studied during either graded hypertension or hypotension.
 In the clot group, the mean vessel caliber of the cerebral arteries on the right side (clot side) of the circle of Willis showed significant (P less than 0.01) reduction (more than 40%) as compared with the values on the contralateral, non-clot side.
 The values for the bilateral parietal CBF in the sham-operated group and the left parietal CBF in the clot group were fairly constant when the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was in the range of 60 to 160 mm Hg.
 In the clot group, right parietal CBF was significantly (P less than 0.05) smaller than that on the left side at an MABP level of 40 to 100 mm Hg, and increased at an MABP level of 180 mm Hg.
 The right parietal CBF increased as the arterial blood pressure increased, showing impairment of autoregulation.

1691,"Surgical staging of cervical cancer.
 Noninvasive radiologic methods to detect paraaortic lymph node metastases are reliable when combined with FNA of enlarged lymph nodes.
 However, the sensitivity is low, and undetected microscopic metastases leads to treatment failure.
 These patients with paraaortic lymph node metastasis are not treated with extended-field radiation, and they all die within 3 years.
 The CT scanning is probably the best diagnostic method to evaluate cervical cancer, because it can assess the primary tumor, the urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, liver parenchyma, and retroperitoneum.
 It also permits the guidance of FNA and the arrangement of radiation ports.
 Surgical staging provides the direct assessment of the peritoneal cavity and the retroperitoneal spaces.
 Metastatic tumor, including enlarged lymph nodes, can be resected, but this is of dubious benefit.
 The operative morbidity is acceptable, with fewer intestinal complications when the extraperitoneal approach is used, and long-term morbidity is minimal when appropriate paraaortic radiation doses are employed (less than 5,000 cGy).
 Surgical staging has provided data on the frequency of paraaortic lymph node metastasis by stage of cervical cancer, and thus, treatment strategies can be better developed.
 Extended-field radiation results in 5-year survival rates of 20-25% in patients with microscopic paraaortic lymph node metastasis, patients who would not survive without the treatment.
 However, surgical staging has produced only a modest boost in survival rates, because of the high rate of pelvic and systemic failure.
 When extended-field radiation is used prophylactically or in patients with probable lymph node metastasis seen on radiographic studies, survival rates are similar to patients irradiated after surgical staging finds paraaortic lymph node disease.
 As our ability to predict, and detect nonsurgically, positive paraaortic node disease improves, extended radiation (or other adjuvant therapy) could be used more frequently without operation in patients who are at high risk for metastatic disease.
 In a study by Haie et al, prophylactic paraaortic radiation was given to patients at high risk for paraaortic metastasis.
 In patients with a high probability of local disease control, paraaortic radiation significantly reduced the incidence of paraaortic and distant metastases.
 Patients with known paraaortic lymph node metastases frequently have occult systemic metastases.
 In these same patients, pelvic failure is also common.
 Thus, until effective systemic therapies emerge, a marked improvement in survival is unlikely in patients who have paraaortic lymph node metastasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

1692,"Platelet fatty acids and function in two distinct regions of Belgium: relationship to age and dietary habits.
 We compared the dietary habits, fatty acid composition of plasma and platelet phospholipids, and platelet function in two groups of healthy Belgian male subjects, known to differ in their mortality rate from coronary heart disease (CHD).
 In the Walloon subjects, there was a larger intake of saturated and a lower intake of (n-6) polyunsaturated fats, confirmed by the fatty acid composition of plasma and platelet phospholipids.
 While plasma HDL and total cholesterol were similar in the present samples of the two communities, platelet aggregation to epinephrine was significantly higher in the Walloon subjects.
 When the two populations were divided into younger (28-54 years) and older (55-73 years) age groups, the older Walloon subjects exhibited platelet hyper-aggregability to most of the agonists, compared to the other three groups.
 In addition to dietary fats, alcohol and smoking habits, age was an important determinant of platelet phospholipid fatty acids and platelet reactivity.
 The present results reinforce those of previous studies, indicating that platelet behaviour is significantly affected by the main risk factors for CHD.

1693,"Diagnosis and evaluation of renovascular hypertension. Indications for therapy.
 Renovascular hypertension is caused by two distinct conditions with different causes, fibromuscular dysplasia and atheroma.
 Diagnosis of the former is both simpler and more rewarding, whereas atheromatous lesions of the renal artery may be secondary to essential hypertension.
 It is therefore important to establish existence of functional renal ischemia as well as an anatomical lesion.
 Universal screening of all hypertensive patients is not recommended because of the relatively low prevalence of the disease and insufficient accuracy of available screening tests.
 When renovascular hypertension is clinically suspected, an oral captopril test is the most reliable office screening test.
 After this, digital subtraction angiography with renal vein renins or captopril renography are appropriate steps.
 However, the latter procedure, while promising, requires further evaluation.
 Duplex scanning of the renal arteries also comes into this category.
 Arteriography is done last, so that if renal ischemia is indicated, angioplasty can be attempted at the same time as arteriography.

 Correlation between neu/c-erbB-2/Her-2 gene amplification and overexpression of the neu gene product has been reported in tumors of glandular origin, especially ductal breast carcinomas.
 Formalin-fixed and dewaxed sections from 23 cases of mammary (MPD) and 9 cases of extramammary (EPD) Paget's disease were immunohistochemically stained by means of the monoclonal antibody 3B5 directed against an intracellular domain of the neu gene protein.
 All MPDs exhibited a distinct membrane staining of tumor cells independent of the presence of ductal breast carcinomas found in 18 cases.
 All these breast carcinomas also were positive for neu staining.
 In contrast to MPD, all EPDs were negative.
 Normal epidermis was always negative.
 Northern blot analysis sustained the immunohistologic findings in that the presence of neu mRNA could be demonstrated in two of three cases with MPD.
 Negativity in one case was due to dilution effects by nontumor cells.
 Our results suggest that Paget cells of mammary and extramammary localization, although very similar phenotypically, derive from different genetic accidents.
 Furthermore neu positivity in all MPDs and all underlying ductal carcinomas suggests common genetic alterations for both tumors.
 However the finding of five neu protein-positive MPDs without associated ductal breast carcinomas may suggest a somewhat different transformation process.

 Total nuclear proteins extracted from cell lines representing various stages of differentiation of mouse B lymphocytes were studied by computer analysis of two-dimensional gels.
 Of the 1438 spots present on the gels, 55 varied significantly in intensity during differentiation.
 The variations occurred most often in steps correlating with those classically defined for B-cell differentiation.
 Seventeen spots were not detectable in at least one of the stages (qualitative variations) and could represent switching on or off of genes coding for nuclear proteins.
 Detailed analysis of the 55 variable spots showed that they fall into small sets characterized by similar expression profiles, which argues for a combinatorial, multistep control mechanism of gene expression.
 In addition, analysis of the expression of all the nuclear proteins resolved on the gels clearly differentiated B-lineage cells from myeloid cells and suggested that the most important transition in B-cell differentiation occurs between the resting B cell and plasmocyte stages.

 Previous studies have suggested that education and race may affect performance on standardized mental status tests.
 In order to more clearly define these relationships, a prospective longitudinal study was devised to answer two questions: (1) whether race or level of education affects scores on the Mini-Mental State (MMS) exam in non-demented people and (2) what numerical cutpoints maximize the sensitivity and specificity of utilizing the MMS to help diagnose dementia in blacks of varying educational attainment.
 A total of 100 white and 258 black individuals, recruited from two city hospital primary care geriatric clinics, were evaluated and subsequently followed longitudinally over a 2 1/2 year period in order to assess accurately the presence or absence of dementia.
 In the non-demented, total MMS scores and performance on each item of the MMS were analyzed, revealing that people with an 8th grade or less education consistently had significantly (P less than .01) worse results than the better educated (9th grade or better) on borough, attention items, recall of table and dog, copying, sentence writing, phrase repeating, and total score.
 Furthermore, a total of 25% of the lower education group had an MMS score in the 18-23 range, traditionally thought to suggest dementia.
 There were no consistently significant differences between blacks and whites of equal education.
 In the better educated groups, using a score of 23 or less to define dementia maximizes the sensitivity and specificity of using the MMS in this diagnosis at 93% and 100%, respectively.
 In the lower education group, using 17 or less to define dementia maximizes sensitivity and specificity at 81% and 100%, respectively.

 The results in nineteen patients (twenty-one knees) who had a failed unicompartmental knee replacement followed by a revision total knee arthroplasty were evaluated.
 There were twelve excellent, four good, one fair, and two poor results.
 The interval between the unicompartmental replacement and the revision total knee arthroplasty ranged from eight months to eight years.
 At the time of the revision, a major osseous defect was found in sixteen knees (76 per cent).
 The duration of follow-up after the revision ranged from two to ten years.
 At the most recent follow-up examination, radiographs revealed at least one radiolucent line in thirteen knees (62 per cent).
 The technical difficulties associated with the revision operation are evidence that unicondylar arthroplasty is not a conservative procedure that allows a total knee arthroplasty to be done easily later.
 The results also do not support the argument that a revision performed after failure of a unicondylar arthroplasty is less technically demanding than one performed after a failed primary total knee arthroplasty.

 The promotion of healing of large abscess cavities attained with topical phenytoin was evaluated in controlled studies of clinical and experimental wounds.
 In the clinical abscess cavities, phenytoin application in 20 patients compared with conventional treatment in 20 patients resulted in earlier separation of slough, decrease in oedema, control of pain and overall enhanced healing.
 The mean(s.d.) rate of reduction of wound area was 2.02(0.48) cm2/day in the phenytoin group versus 1.58(0.51) cm2/day in controls (P less than 0.05) on day 10, and 1.8(0.32) cm2/day versus 1.19(0.21) cm2/day (P less than 0.01) on day 20.

 In recent years, there has been a growing consensus among investigators that the presence or absence of external cues guiding behaviour and attention is an important factor in determining whether or not deficits are found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
 In an earlier study, the authors suggested that the pattern of impaired and intact performance could be explained in terms of differential resource demands of the tasks, combined with depleted levels of central processing resources in PD patients.
 Two experiments are reported, both employing dual-task paradigms.
 The first assessed, in normal subjects, the relative processing demands of a cued and an uncued version of the Stroop task.
 The results supported the proposal that the noncued task made greater demands on the subject's limited processing resources.
 Further, performing a resource demanding secondary task concurrently with the Stroop test produced, in normal subjects, the same pattern of impaired performance as that reported previously in PD patients.
 In the second experiment the same dual-task paradigm was employed with a group of PD patients and normal aged-matched controls.
 Only the patients showed an increase in reaction time on the Stroop task when performing a resource demanding secondary task.
 The patients also showed an interfering effect with concurrent foot tapping but not with an articulatory suppression task.
 The results were taken to support the hypothesis that PD patients have depleted central processing resources.
 In considering the present data, alternative explanations for the results are considered, in particular the possibility that they represent a deficit in switching processing resources between two tasks as the combined demands outweigh available resources.

 The application of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) to the diagnosis of nonpalpable breast lesions was evaluated with a new method which uses standard needle localization under mammographic guidance to assure accurate sampling by FNAB.
 This method was prospectively applied to 100 mammographically detected breast lesions in 100 women (mean age, 53 years).
 All 100 patients underwent surgical excision of these nonpalpable lesions after cytologic aspiration.
 Sufficient aspirated material was obtained for cytologic diagnosis from 91 patients (91%).
 The histologic and cytologic interpretations were then compared.
 Twenty malignancies were ultimately diagnosed by histology (12 invasive ductal carcinoma, six ductal carcinoma in situ, and two lobular carcinoma in situ), of which 17 had been cytologically diagnosed.
 There were no false-positive diagnoses of malignancy by FNAB.
 False-negative readings (3.3%) included two cases of lobular carcinoma in situ and one case of ductal carcinoma in situ.
 This technique thus demonstrated a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 100%, and overall diagnostic accuracy of 96.7% for the nonsurgical detection of malignancy in nonpalpable breast lesions.
 These results suggest that the established safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of FNAB can be maintained in this clinical setting.
 This procedure may obviate the need for open surgical biopsy in those patients with an unequivocal diagnosis of malignancy.
 It can also be done using standard techniques and equipment available in many community hospitals.

 Human cancers have an apparent low growth fraction, the bulk of cells presumed to being out of cycle in a G0 quiescent state due to the inability in the past to distinguish G0 from G1 cells.
 The allosteric M1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (M1-RR) is constitutively expressed by cycling cells (i.e., G1, S, G2-M).
 It is acquired during transition from G0 to G1, lost during exit to G0 and thus distinguishes G0 from G1 cells.
 To estimate the proportion of G0 and G1 cells in primary human breast (n = 5) and colorectal (n = 12) adenocarcinomas, we used both analytical DNA flow cytometry (ADFC) and immunoperoxidase staining of sections with the monoclonal antibody to M1-RR (MAb M1-RR).
 ADFC of fresh tumors revealed a low percentage of cells in the S phase (4.0 +/- 3.4%) but immunoperoxidase staining for M1-RR revealed an unexpectedly high proportion of positive cells (52.4 +/- 12.7%) in the G1, S, G2-M phases indicating a high G1 content of primary human tumors.
 Thus, human cancers are blocked in transition in G1 and are not predominantly in a G0 or quiescent differentiated state.
 This block was interpreted to mean that human cancers are responding to putative regulatory events at a restriction point in the G1 phase, such as relative growth factor deficiency, density inhibition, antiproliferative cytokines, or gene products.
 Using flow cytometry for both DNA and M1-RR content we found that human colon cancer cell lines arrest in the G1 but not G0 phase upon serum deprivation or density inhibition.
 Similarly, human breast cancer cell lines are arrested in G1 but not G0 phase by medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or tamoxifen exposure.
 These findings match our in situ observations, and support the concept of a restriction point block in primary human tumors.

 Small bowel obstruction was the most frequent significant complication, occurring in ten patients (11.5%) and resulting in a prolongation of hospital stay by 7 days at an additional cost of $6,500 per patient.
 One additional patient developed a subphrenic abscess which required operative drainage, necessitating an additional 24 days in the hospital at an increased cost of $22,200.
 Other complications which did not prolong hospital stay included eight superficial wound infections, one transient respiratory failure, and two patients who returned at a later date with incisional hernias at the stoma site.
 The 25% morbidity encountered in this series suggests that colostomy closure is not a low-morbidity procedure and should be considered as an important factor favoring primary repair.
 Coupled with the significant financial impact of both colostomy formation and takedown, ample justification exists for greater efforts in avoiding colostomy formation whenever feasible.

 In a cohort of 170 middle and upper-middle class children participating in a prospective study of child development and low-level lead exposure, higher blood lead levels at age 24 months were associated with lower scores at age 57 months on the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities.
 The mean blood lead level at age 24 months was 6.8 micrograms/dL (SD = 6.3; 75th, 90th, and 99th percentiles: 8.8, 13.7, 23.6, respectively) and for all but 1 child was less than 25 micrograms/dL, the current definition of an ""elevated"" level.
 After adjustment for confounding, scores on the General Cognitive Index decreased approximately 3 points (SE = 1.4) for each natural log unit increase in 24-month blood lead level.
 The inverse association between lead level and performance was especially prominent for visual-spatial and visual-motor integration skills.
 Higher prenatal exposures were not associated with lower scores at 57 months except in the subgroup of children with ""high"" concurrent blood lead levels (ie, greater than or equal to 10 micrograms/dL).
 The concentration of lead in the dentine of shed deciduous teeth was not significantly associated with children's performance after adjustment for confounding.

 The authors carried out successful total sacrectomy in three cases, two with giant cell tumors and one with a chordoma.
 The anterior and posterior approach is feasible for resecting huge sacral tumors en bloc, but it is important to reconstruct the continuity between the pelvic ring and spinal column using spinal instrumentation and sacral rods or AO plates.
 As total sacrectomy is a large-scale, time-consuming, and collaborative operation, two or three teams should be used in relays.
 Both pelvic and spinal surgical techniques are required.
 Post-operatively the patient can stand within 3 to 6 months and well-planned rehabilitation allows ambulation.
 In spite of the serious structural and neurologic damage caused, total sacrectomy can be rewarding procedure in terms of improved morbidity and mortality.

1709,"Monitoring of cortical blood flow during temporary arterial occlusion in aneurysm surgery by the thermal diffusion method.
 During aneurysm surgery, regional cortical blood flow (CoBF) was continuously monitored in 12 patients with a thermal diffusion flow probe in an attempt to assess the effects of temporary major arterial occlusion on blood flow and outcome.
 When the CoBF was above 30 ml/100 g/min, the safe period for temporary clipping applied distal to the perforators was 15 minutes.
 The occlusion time should be shortened when the CoBF is below 30 ml/100 g/min.
 Two patients suffered basal infarction, which was not detected by CoBF monitoring.
 Attention should be paid to the blood flow in the deep structures when a temporary clip is applied at a site proximal to the perforating branches.
 Direct measurement of CoBF may be of value in estimating the time that temporary occlusion of a major vessel can be tolerated.

 This study examined the pharmacokinetics of 300 mg of tiaprofenic acid, a NSAID belonging to the 2-arylpropionic class, as a single oral dose, in 10 migraine patients during and out of migraine attacks.
 Plasma concentration of tiaprofenic acid was determined by HPLC analysis.
 Drug absorption appeared to be the same during and out of migraine attacks (absorption half life: during attack, 0.249 +/- 0.122 hr; out of attack, 0.249 +/- 0.105 hr; maximum plasma concentration: during attack, 37.8 +/- 9.8 ug/ml; out of attack, 40.1 +/- 13.2 ug/ml).
 The other pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated were not affected by headache attacks as well.
 We conclude that tiaprofenic acid absorption and metabolism are not affected by migraine attacks.
 Also, our data suggest that tiaprofenic acid might be useful in the treatment of migraine.

 Thirty-one children aged 3 to 15 years were followed for 5 to 11 years after suffering severe closed head trauma which caused coma for 1 week or more (median duration of coma 3 weeks).
 One patient remained in a persistent vegetative state until his death 9 years later.
 The other 30 recovered consciousness and were discharged.
 All suffered diminution of their abilities, and 24 of them had major permanent disability.
 The most common motor disabilities were pure spastic hemiparesis (seven cases), basal ganglia syndromes (four cases), ataxia (three cases), and a combination of hemiparesis and ataxia (five cases).
 Of the 30 patients, 26 regained independent ambulation, seven were epileptic, and 14 were dysarthric in various degrees.
 Only 10 had the cognitive ability to profit from the normal educational system, and none had attempted postsecondary education.
 Social problems were common.
 The worst outcomes were associated with intracranial bleeding and/or brain contusion seen on computerized tomography (CT) scans at the acute stage; the best were associated with normal CT scans.
 The degree of residual disability in these children seems no less than that of adults with trauma of similar severity.

1712,"Preoperative measurement of pulmonary vascular resistance in complete transposition of the great arteries.
 Transposition of the great arteries is frequently complicated by the early onset of pulmonary vascular disease.
 It is difficult to measure pulmonary blood flow by the Fick principle because the pulmonary arteriovenous oxygen content difference is small and bronchial blood flow is increased in this condition.
 In eight patients (mean age 7.7 years, range 3 months to 29 years) with transposition of the great arteries mass spectrometry was used to measure oxygen uptake and predict pulmonary end capillary blood oxygen content.
 The effects of the bronchial circulation were studied by computer modelling.
 There was close agreement between pulmonary end capillary and pulmonary vein blood oxygen contents but the resultant percentage difference in arteriovenous content difference was significant (mean (SE of difference)) (14.5(3.8)%).
 The effect of the bronchial circulation was to give spuriously high estimates of pulmonary blood flow.
 The error was greatest when oxygen consumption was low and aortic blood was very desaturated.

 In 46 elderly (aged greater than or equal to 60 y) hypertensive subjects with entry systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 160 or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg, our specific aim in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study (two 8-wk treatment periods separated by a 3-wk washout) was to compare blood pressure-lowering effects of 9 g fish oil/d [omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid] vs 9 g corn oil/d [omega-6 (n-6) fatty acid].
 After a 4-wk baseline period, 22 subjects were randomly assigned to receive fish oil and 24 to receive corn oil.
 For both 8-wk treatments there were no between-group differences in the change in blood pressure.
 There was a treatment difference for standing DBP when baseline values were compared with those after treatment 2; DBP decreased by 5.1 mm Hg in the fish-oil group vs 0.72 mm Hg in the corn-oil group (P = 0.024).
 Within groups during the first treatment, both fish oil and corn oil lowered all four blood pressure measures (P less than 0.05); blood pressures were not further lowered during the second treatment compared with the washout period.
 There were no significant between-group differences in laboratory safety tests or categorical side effects.
 Fish oil lowered triglycerides by 0.47 mmol/L (P less than 0.001).

 The effect of buflomedil to protect skin tissue from ischemia and necrosis was studied in random cutaneous flaps.
 Measurements were performed by intravital microscopy on the microcirculatory level of capillary perfusion in a flap model in the hairless mouse.
 In 30 hairless mice, single-pedicle flaps measuring 6 x 16 mm were raised perpendicular to the spine of the animal.
 This flap develops a reliable amount of necrosis at its distal edge over a period of 7 days.
 A group of 10 mice received intravenous injections of buflomedil in doses of 3 mg/kg per day diluted in 0.1 ml normal saline beginning 4 hours before flap elevation and for 6 consecutive days postoperatively.
 In addition, 10 further animals received the same treatment except that it was started 5 minutes after flap elevation.
 In 10 mice serving as controls, normal saline in equal volumes as in the experimental groups was applied.
 By means of intravital microscopy, functional vessel density (FVD) was determined in 2.5-mm increments from the flap's base to its distal edge at 1, 6, and 24 hours after elevation.
 Skin-flap survival was quantified by measuring the necrotic area on day 7 by means of digital planimetry.
 Functional vessel density was preserved in the distal flap of animals pretreated with buflomedil, revealing a higher functional vessel density at 10.0 mm (p less than 0.01), 12.5 mm (p less than 0.05), and 15.0 mm (p less than 0.001) from the flap's base as compared with controls.

1715,"Management of multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease in patients with hypertension.
 Hypertension intervention trials, which have involved mainly the use of diuretics and beta-blockers, have demonstrated a disappointing benefit in terms of reduction of coronary heart disease (CHD).
 Rather than suggesting that elevated blood pressure and CHD are not causally related, these data suggest that the antihypertensive agents used were not optimal for the management of hypertension and a review of the currently recommended therapies is needed.
 Major risk factors for CHD, which include increased blood pressure, elevated serum cholesterol levels, and smoking, are highly prevalent in the general population and appear to cluster in patients with hypertension.
 Therefore the treatment of hypertension demands a multifactorial approach, one that takes into consideration all the risk factors for CHD.
 Diuretics and beta-blockers adversely affect the serum lipid profile, and this could negate some of the CHD benefit afforded by blood pressure reduction.

 We evaluated the effect of nicardipine, a calcium channel blocker, on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in 26 patients with acute cerebral infarction.
 Post treatment, 58% (15/26) of the N20 and P25 latencies were prolonged in the affected hemispheres; 8% (2/26) were shortened; and 35% (9/26) did not change.
 The mean N20 and P25 latencies were significantly prolonged two hours post treatment in the affected hemisphere (N20, P less than 0.01, P25 P less than 0.01).
 Nicardipine (Ni) had no effect on SEP components in the intact hemispheres.
 Seventy five per cent of the 12 patients with hypertension had a decrease in blood pressure (BP) after taking nicardipine, but there were no undesirable side effects or worsening of neurological signs.
 Our study demonstrates that nicardipine prolongs the latencies of short-latency components of SEP in the affected hemisphere after acute ischaemic stroke and also decreases BP.
 These observations suggest that nicardipine therapy might impair neuronal function in the ischaemic zone.

 In order to evaluate the effects of one-year antihypertensive treatment on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, 65 patients whose diastolic blood pressure was in the range 95-120 mmHg were randomly allocated to groups that received either hydrochlorothiazide or metoprolol, or both drugs when the response to one of them was insufficient to control blood pressure.
 Blood pressure was effectively reduced in all groups.
 Patients on hydrochlorothiazide showed a significant increase (P less than 0.01) in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after 3 months of treatment.
 A significant increase in triglycerides was observed after 6 and 12 months, together with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) after 12 months (P less than 0.05) of treatment in patients on metoprolol.
 In patients treated with both hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol, total cholesterol increased after 3 (P less than 0.001) and 6 months (P less than 0.05), triglycerides increased after 6 (P less than 0.01) and 12 months (P less than 0.01), and LDL-C increased after 3 (P less than 0.05), 6 (P less than 0.001) and 12 months (P less than 0.01) of treatment, respectively.
 In 61% of the patients, three or more lipid parameters were affected during the study period.
 We conclude that long-term antihypertensive treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and particularly with both drugs, can induce lipid effects that deserve recognition, because in some cases these might counteract the possible benefit of a reduction in blood pressure on the prevention of coronary heart disease.

 This study evaluated the relative hemodynamic importance of a normal left ventricular (LV) activation sequence compared to atrioventricular (AV) synchrony with respect to systolic and diastolic function.
 Twelve patients with intact AV conduction and AV sequential pacemakers underwent radionuclide studies at rest and Doppler echocardiographic studies at rest and during submaximal exercise, comparing atrial demand pacing (AAI) to sequential AV sensing pacing (DDD) and ventricular demand pacing (VVI).
 Studies at rest were performed at a constant heart rate between pacing modes, and the exercise study was performed at a constant heart rate and work load.
 Cardiac output was higher during AAI than during both DDD and VVI (6.2 +/- 1 vs 5.6 +/- 1 and 5.3 +/- 1 liters/min, p less than 0.05).
 LV ejection fraction was likewise higher during AAI (55 +/- 12 vs 49 +/- 11 vs 51 +/- 13, p less than 0.05).
 VVI with or without AV synchrony was associated with a paradoxical septal motion pattern, resulting in a 25% impairment of regional septal ejection fraction.
 In addition, LV contraction duration was more homogenous during AAI.

 Cultured human keratinocytes are used for skin grafts, but their success is limited by late graft loss.
 Development of antibody to fetal bovine serum (FBS) protein used in culture media for in vitro keratinocyte growth has been identified.
 The persistence of FBS antigen in skin grafts is important in the induction of the immune response and the susceptibility of the keratinocytes to immune-mediated injury.
 The magnitude and longevity of FBS protein persistence on human keratinocytes was studied.
 Secondary passage human keratinocytes were grown in media supplemented with 5% FBS.
 The media was changed to one supplemented with pooled human AB serum, and the amount of FBS protein incorporated in the tissue was measured over the following 8 days by an ELISA reaction directed against FBS antigen.
 Incorporated FBS antigen decreased for the first 3 days to 31% of maximum.
 There was no further significant decrease for 5 days.
 Keratinocytes grown in alternative serum supplements (NuSerum [Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, Mass.] and Serum Plus [Hazelton Research Products Inc., Lenexa, Kan.]), which contain reduced amounts of FBS, offered no significant reduction in FBS protein incorporation.
 This duration of antigen persistence would make human keratinocytes susceptible to cell destruction by immune response to FBS and may contribute to delayed loss of human keratinocyte grafts.

 Brain potentials may be used to assess the functional abnormalities that underlie impairments of movement.
 The purpose of this article is to illustrate the usefulness of examining these potentials.
 In addition to an overview of the topic, the article includes a report of a study demonstrating that there were differences between the brain potentials of five patients with traumatic brain injury and those of four healthy control subjects.
 All five patients were in the postacute phase of hemiplegia.
 Slow cortical potentials associated with simple goal-directed forearm and finger movements were recorded from frontal and parietal electrodes.
 Two seconds of movement-related electroencephalographic activity (movement-related potential) were recorded.
 The patients showed reduced brain potentials for movements associated with their paretic limb and, to a lesser extent, reduced brain potentials for movements associated with their nonparetic limb.
 The waveforms obtained from the patients were unusual, with uncharacteristic cross-cortical movement-related potential correlations associated with specific electrode configurations, as well as with specific movement conditions.
 Brain potentials associated with the fore-period interval of a simple reaction time paradigm were later recorded in two of the patients with traumatic brain injury and in a control subject to help determine the functional significance of the relative positivity apparent in their movement-related potential data.
 This preliminary study indicates that electroencephalographic potentials obtained during the preparation for and execution of movement can provide information regarding the basis for motor dysfunction.

 Malignant pleural effusions are a common and significant problem in patients with advanced malignancies.
 Pleurodesis with tetracycline or other sclerosing agents is the usual treatment for malignant pleural effusions.
 In contrast to this approach, intrapleural chemotherapy has the potential advantage of treating the underlying malignancy in addition to controlling the effusion.
 Intracavitary cisplatin-based chemotherapy, which is cytotoxic rather than sclerosing, has proven safe and effective via the intraperitoneal route in ovarian cancer and malignant mesothelioma.
 There has been little previous experience, however, with intrapleural cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
 As part of a planned series of trials in malignant mesothelioma, the Lung Cancer Study Group first evaluated intrapleural cisplatin and cytarabine in patients with malignant pleural effusions from a variety of solid tumors.
 From April 1986 to November 1987, 46 patients with cytologically proven, symptomatic, and previously untreated malignant pleural effusions were entered on study.
 A single dose of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 plus cytarabine 1,200 mg was instilled into the pleural space via a chest tube, which was then immediately removed.
 Patients were evaluated for toxicity and response at 24 hours; 1, 2, and 3 weeks; and then monthly.
 No recurrence of the effusion was considered a complete response (CR).
 Partial response (PR) was defined as a 75% or greater decrease in the amount of the effusion on serial chest radiographs.
 One patient experienced reversible grade 4 renal toxicity, four patients had grade 3 hematologic toxicity, and five patients had grade 3 cardiopulmonary toxicity.
 The overall response rate (CR plus PR) at 3 weeks was 49% (18 of 37 patients).
 The median length of response was 9 months for a CR and 5.1 months for a PR.
 The outcome of this trial was sufficiently encouraging that this regimen has been incorporated into subsequent trials for malignant pleural mesothelioma.

 IT-066 (10-60 micrograms/kg) given i.v.
 inhibited histamine-stimulated acid secretion dose-dependently in gastric lumen-perfused rats, and the inhibitory effect was observed for about 12 hr.
 Famotidine (FMD) (10-60 micrograms/kg i.v.) also had an antisecretory effect, but the acid secretion recovered to the control level 4 hr after the administration.
 Cold stress plus indomethacin-induced lesion was significantly inhibited by IT-066 and FMD given i.v.
 30 min before the cold stress plus indomethacin treatment.
 IT-066 given 7 hr before the cold stress plus indomethacin treatment also inhibited lesion formation significantly, but such antilesional effect was not observed with FMD.
 In the rat isolated gastric mucosal sheet, IT-066 inhibited histamine-stimulated acid secretion dose-dependently and noncompetitively; its action was produced via a unique mechanism.
 The inhibitory effect of IT-066 remained after washing of the mucosa, and became more potent time-dependently.
 The inhibitory effects of FMD and cimetidine were not observed after washing the mucosa.
 These data suggest that IT-066 has a potent and long lasting antisecretory effect in vivo and in vitro, and that these properties are responsible for the long lasting antilesional action.

 We examined the effects of pressure overload on coronary circulation in young adult (7 months old) and old rats (18 months old).
 Four weeks after the ascending aorta was banded, in vivo left ventricular pressure was measured to estimate the degree of pressure load.
 In the two age groups, similar increases in peak left ventricular pressure were observed (113 +/- 7 mm Hg in sham-operated rats versus 160 +/- 11 mm Hg in banded rats of the young adult group; 103 +/- 7 mm Hg in sham-operated rats versus 156 +/- 11 mm Hg in banded rats of the old group).
 After isolating the hearts, they were perfused with Tyrode's solution containing bovine red blood cells and albumin.

 In young adult banded rats, significant myocardial hypertrophy was observed at the organ level (124% of controls in left ventricular dry weight/body weight ratio; 119% in left ventricular dry weight/tibial length ratio) and at the cell level.
 Minimal coronary vascular resistance obtained by the perfusion pressure-peak flow relation during reactive hyperemia increased to 150% of controls, and coronary flow reserve decreased significantly.
 In contrast, myocardial hypertrophy was not observed at the organ or cell level in old banded rats.
 However, minimal coronary vascular resistance increased, and flow reserve decreased significantly.
 Thus, pressure overload with coronary arterial hypertension caused abnormalities of the coronary circulation in old subjects even in the absence of myocardial hypertrophy.

 The biomechanical function of the iliolumbar ligament in the human lumbosacral junction was investigated by analyzing the three-dimensional movements of the whole lumbar and lumbo-sacral-ilium specimens.
 The experiment was repeated in the following three conditions: 1) intact iliolumbar ligament, 2) right iliolumbar ligament transected, and 3) bilateral iliolumbar ligaments transected.
 The representative values of the increased motions, compared with intact, after transection of the bilateral iliolumbar ligaments were 1.7 degrees (23%) in flexion, 1.1 degrees (20%) in extension, 0.3 degrees (18%) in axial rotation, and 1.2 degrees (29%) in lateral bending.
 The most restricted motion governed by the iliolumbar ligament in the lumbosacral junction was lateral bending.
 The bilateral iliolumbar ligament specimen could restrict flexion and extension of the lumbosacral junction, but the unilateral iliolumbar ligament preparation alone could not restrict these motions.

 We evaluated the effect of altered loading conditions on left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure-volume relations during acute coronary artery occlusion that was produced by inflation of an intracoronary balloon.
 Open-chest anesthetized dogs (n = 18) were instrumented so that LV pressure (micromanometer) and LV volume (conductance) could be measured without disturbing the pericardium.
 The effects of brief periods of occlusion (1-2 minutes) were assessed under steady-state conditions before and after dextran infusion with the pericardium present and absent and during vena caval occlusion.
 Under steady-state conditions before dextran infusion with the pericardium removed, at an LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP) of 8.4 +/- 1.4 mm Hg, occlusion resulted in a rightward shift in the diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop (delta LVEDP, 2.7 +/- 2.3 mm Hg; delta LVEDV, 6.3 +/- 4.7 ml, both p less than 0.05 versus control).
 After dextran infusion (LVEDP, 20.9 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), occlusion resulted in a rightward and upward shift in the diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop (delta LVEDP, 5.8 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; delta LVEDV, 4.2 +/- 3.0 ml, both p less than 0.05 versus control).
 At low cardiac volumes before dextran infusion, the intact pericardium did not affect the response to occlusion.
 By contrast, after dextran infusion in the presence of an intact pericardium, LVEDP significantly increased (delta, 6.4 +/- 3.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) but LVDEV did not (delta, 0.7 +/- 1.5 ml, p = NS).
 There was a parallel upward shift in the diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop that was eliminated by removal of the pericardium.
 Thus, the change in LV diastolic pressure and volume during occlusion varied and depended on the baseline cardiac volume and presence of the pericardium.
 Before dextran infusion with the pericardium present and absent, coronary artery occlusion did not alter the LV diastolic chamber stiffness parameter, which was calculated from the diastolic interval of an averaged steady-state beat (0.040 +/- 0.019 versus 0.036 +/- 0.015 mm Hg/ml, p = NS).
 After dextran infusion with the pericardium present and absent, coronary artery occlusion increased the LV diastolic chamber stiffness parameter (0.057 +/- 0.034 and 0.074 +/- 0.034 mm Hg/ml, both p less than 0.05 versus controls, respectively).

 Impaired left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling at rest is frequently observed in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who have normal LV systolic function and no previous infarction.
 To test the hypothesis that abnormal diastolic function at rest might reflect the functional severity of CAD, as estimated by exercise-induced ischemia, the relation between regional and global LV diastolic function at rest and during exercise-induced ischemia was evaluated in 49 patients with radionuclide angiography.
 All patients had normal systolic function at rest.
 Group 1 (n = 26) patients manifested a normal ejection fraction response to exercise and group 2 (n = 23) patients an abnormal response.
 Data obtained from 22 age-comparable normal volunteers were used for comparison.
 Although regional and global diastolic function were not different between normal subjects and group 1 patients, peak filling rate was lower in group 2 patients than in normal subjects (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs 3.2 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic counts/s; p less than 0.01).
 Moreover, regional diastolic asynchrony, as assessed from the radionuclide data by using a regional sector analysis of the LV region of interest, was greater in group 2 patients (46 +/- 44 ms) than in both normal subjects (25 +/- 16 ms; p less than 0.05) and group 1 patients (23 +/- 16 ms; p less than 0.05).
 Thus, among patients with CAD and with normal LV systolic function at rest, impaired LV filling and regional asynchrony predict a greater degree of exercise-induced ischemia, suggesting a greater extent of jeopardized myocardium.

1732,"Vaginal epithelial abnormalities in patients with CIN: clinical and pathological features and management.
 Of 4147 women who had CIN treated by laser at the Regional Gynaecological Oncology Centre, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, 103 (2.5%) had co-existing vaginal epithelial abnormalities.
 CIN 3 was the histological diagnosis most often associated with vaginal lesions.
 The upper vagina was almost always involved.
 In 67% the lesion in the cervix appeared to be confluent with that in the vagina.
 Even when the lesions were confluent, biopsies form the cervical and vaginal components did not always show the same grade of intraepithelial neoplasia and in some biopsies they showed different lesions.
 Laser treatment appears to be effective for the vaginal lesions and is therefore recommended although, in selected patients, careful follow up alone may suffice.

1733,"Limb reconstruction with vascularized fibular grafts after bone tumor resection.
 Limb-salvage operations are being used with increasing frequency for patients with malignant bone tumors.
 For children, when a biologic reconstruction is desired, the choice is often between conventional and vascularized fibular grafts.
 An experimental study was performed in dogs to compare the two types of fibular grafts for bridging segmental defects in the radius and ulna.
 Twenty-six adult dogs were divided into two groups and studied at intervals of two, three, four, six, and 12 months after transplantation.
 The conventional grafts healed by creeping substitution i.e., they were first partially resorbed before new bone was laid down.
 In contrast, the vascularized fibulae maintained their normal structure and hypertrophied by subperiosteal new bone formation.
 The conventional fibulae eventually hypertrophied but much later than the vascularized grafts.
 The vascularized grafts were stronger at four and six months.
 Between six and 12 months, both grafts remodeled to resemble the size and shape of the forearm bones they were replacing.
 These experimental results have influenced the treatment of patients.
 Vascularized fibular grafts are ideal for diaphyseal defects greater than 10 cm long, especially in very young children, a poorly vascularized bed, or when bone healing is delayed by chemotherapeutic agents.
 To maximize hypertrophy, an external fixator is used to immobilize the graft rather than a plate, which acts as a stress shield.

1734,"Arterial mechanical properties in dilated cardiomyopathy. Aging and the response to nitroprusside.
 The effects of aging on arterial mechanical properties and the response to nitroprusside were examined in 25 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
 High-fidelity pressures were recorded with a multisensor catheter.
 Pulse wave velocity was determined between two sensors in the thoracic aorta.
 Arterial compliance was determined by an analysis of the diastolic waveform and cardiac output.
 At baseline, despite a similar systemic vascular resistance, the pulsatile load (e.g., arterial compliance) and wave transmission characteristics (e.g., pulse wave velocity) were altered with aging.
 Arterial compliance was reduced in older (greater than 50 yr, n = 8) versus younger (less than 35 yr, n = 8) patients (0.51 +/- 0.17 vs.
 1.33 +/- 0.63 ml/mmHg, P less than 0.01) and intermediate in those 35-50 yr of age (n = 9, 0.72 +/- 0.40 ml/mmHg).
 There was a positive correlation between age and pulse wave velocity (r = +0.90).
 Nitroprusside infusion decreased resistance, increased arterial compliance, and lowered pulse wave velocity in all groups.
 Yet, advancing age was associated with a greater fall in wave velocity for a given fall in aortic pressure.
 The slope (K) of the relation between pulse wave velocity and aortic diastolic pressure progressively increased with age (0.01 +/- 0.03, 0.06 +/- 0.02, and 0.09 +/- 0.03 m/s-mmHg).
 Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant relation between K and age.
 These data demonstrate that in older patients with dilated cardiomyopathy the left ventricle is coupled to an arterial circulation that has a greater pulsatile load, despite a similar steady load.
 Furthermore, these age-related changes in the arterial system affect the hemodynamic response to pharmacologically-induced vasodilatation.

 Rett syndrome is a disorder noted to date only in females and characterized by a pervasive developmental disability following apparently normal early infancy.
 In addition to gait difficulties, stereotypic hand movements, and loss of communication and purposeful hand skills, autistic-like behavior is an early sign that often results in misdiagnosis.
 Despite these significant clinical abnormalities, neuropathologic features are modest, and no consistent laboratory abnormality or diagnostic marker has been identified.
 The current status of research in RS is considered within the context of autism and other disorders in which autistic features may occur, such as the fragile X syndrome.

 A randomized trial was undertaken to compare the biofragmental anastomotic ring (BAR) with conventional intraperitoneal colorectal anastomotic techniques.
 Patients were randomized into one of two schemes: BAR versus sutured or BAR versus stapled anastomosis.
 There were 782 patients entered into the study and 283 patients (36%) had a sutured anastomosis, 104 patients (13%) had a stapled anastomosis, and 395 (51%) had the BAR.
 Comparison of the BAR with combined suture and stapled controls revealed no significant differences in wound complication, abscess rate, bleeding, anastomotic leaks, ileus, obstruction, or deaths.
 There were no differences in return of bowel function, return to normal diet, or hospital stay.
 Intraoperative difficulties occurred in 46 BAR patients (17%), and this was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than for sutured (3%) but not for stapled anastomoses (11%).
 The occurrence of these problems did not adversely effect the outcome.
 The data suggest that the BAR is a safe, satisfactory alternative to sutured or stapled colorectal anastomoses.

1738,"Studies of controlled reperfusion after ischemia. XX. Reperfusate composition: detrimental effects of initial asanguineous cardioplegic washout after acute coronary occlusion.
 This study tests whether initial asanguineous washout of potentially toxic substances that accumulate during ischemia improves recovery produced by blood cardioplegic reperfusion and evaluates the role of plasma versus whole blood cardioplegia.
 METHODS: Twenty-four dogs underwent 2 hours of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 20 minutes of blood cardioplegic reperfusion on total vented bypass.
 In 13 dogs, a 5-minute infusion of either a crystalloid (n = 7) or plasma (n = 6) cardioplegic solution (containing the same pH, calcium potassium, and osmolarity as blood cardioplegia) was given immediately before reoxygenation with blood cardioplegia.
 Regional oxygen uptake and coronary vascular resistance were measured during controlled reperfusion, and segmental shortening (ultrasonic crystals), tissue water content, and histochemical damage (triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain) were assessed 1 hour after bypass was discontinued.
 RESULTS: Asanguineous cardioplegic washout before reoxygenation with blood cardioplegic solution resulted in a progressive (+42%) increase in coronary vascular resistances (from 123 to 176 units, p less than 0.05) and low oxygen utilization during 20 minutes of blood cardioplegic reperfusion (29 ml/100 gm, p less than 0.05); coronary vascular resistance remained low throughout blood cardioplegic reperfusion without washout (from 109 to 98 units), and oxygen utilization was 54 ml/100 gm (p less than 0.05).
 Neither plasma nor crystalloid washout restored substantial regional systolic shortening (3% systolic shortening versus 73% systolic shortening with blood cardioplegia), and asanguineous washout caused more myocardial edema (81.1% +/- 80.9% versus 79.5% water content, p less than 0.05) and produced extensive transmural triphenyltetrazolium chloride damage (48% +/- 41% versus 8% nonstaining in area at risk, p less than 0.05) than initial blood cardioplegic reperfusion.
 CONCLUSION: Asanguineous cardioplegic washout before blood cardioplegic reperfusion limits oxygen utilization during subsequent controlled reperfusion, restricts early recovery of systolic shortening, allows more myocardial edema, and produces extensive histochemical damage, which may be avoided by initial reoxygenation with blood cardioplegia.
 The red blood cells appear more important than the plasma components of blood cardioplegia.

 We reviewed 28 patients with Takayasu's disease to determine the incidence of stroke and its relationship to the involvement of the thoracic aortic arch and its branches.
 We describe surgical experiences with 10 of the 28 patients who required 21 vascular surgical procedures for critical thoracic aortic arch arterial stenoses, upper and lower extremity ischemia, and renal artery stenoses.
 Four of the 28 patients initially had a stroke caused by occlusion of one or more thoracic aortic arch arteries.
 Six of the 10 patients underwent 7 bypass procedures for critical thoracic arch stenoses.
 All have remained free of stroke for 5 or more years.
 Four patients had five anastomotic stenoses or graft occlusions in late follow-up; the development of these stenoses did not relate to disease activity at the time of the operative procedure.
 All bypass grafts originating from the subclavian axillary artery developed anastomotic stenoses; no anastomotic stenoses occurred in bypass grafts originating from the ascending aorta.
 In contrast to other reports, no anastomotic false aneurysms occurred.
 Occlusions of major aortic arch arteries in Takayasu's disease cause stroke.
 Bypass of critically stenoses aortic arch arteries protects against stroke and is best performed with grafts originating from the ascending aorta.
 Anastomotic stenoses but not anastomotic aneurysms are common.
 This study suggests that aggressive surgical treatment can be performed with good results.

1740,"Plasticity of integrin expression by nerve-derived connective tissue cells. Human Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and fibroblasts express markedly different patterns of beta 1 integrins during nerve development, neoplasia, and in vitro.
 Strikingly selective expression patterns of beta 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 integrin subunits were revealed in endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium of fetal and adult human peripheral nerve by immunostaining with specific antibodies.
 The alpha 2 subunit was expressed only on Schwann cells both in fetal and adult nerve, whereas the alpha 3 epitopes were expressed exclusively in the adult tissue and were primarily present on perineurial cells.
 The alpha 5 epitopes were expressed only on the innermost cell layer of perineurium of fetal and adult nerve.
 The tumor cells within schwannomas and cutaneous neurofibromas expressed both alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits, indicating that Schwann cells have the potential to express also the alpha 3 subunit in vivo.
 Cell cultures established from human fetal nerve and neurofibromas revealed expression of the alpha 2 and alpha 5 epitopes on Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and fibroblasts, whereas only Schwann cells contained the alpha 3 epitopes which were occasionally concentrated on the adjacent Schwann cells at cell-cell contacts.
 Our findings emphasize that nerve connective tissue cells change their profiles for expression of extracellular matrix receptors under conditions which have different regulatory control signals exerted by, for example, axons, humoral factors, or the extracellular matrix of the peripheral nerve.
 This plasticity may play an important role during nerve development and in neoplastic processes affecting the connective tissue compartments of peripheral nerve.

 Although the argon laser is used successfully to weld a number of different tissues, the underlying chemical and cellular mechanisms for this process are not precisely defined.
 Consequently, a biochemical model has been developed in vitro using the well-defined extracellular matrix from the murine Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) sarcoma.
 Control and experimental samples of EHS basement membranes were irradiated with a Trimedyne argon laser at 500-3,000 Joules/cm2 at 0 degrees C.
 The samples were diluted into cold phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to gel at 35 degrees C.
 The time course of the gelation reaction was followed in a spectrophotometer at 360 nm.
 Irradiation reduced the absorbance 7.5-15% compared to controls and was independent of the dilution over a 10-fold range.
 Gelation was also measured by determining the amount of protein by the Bradford assay that could be collected by centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 minutes.
 Argon-irradiated samples had 30-40% less protein in the precipitate than the controls.
 The addition of 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol to the EHS extract blocked the effect of the laser on the gelation reaction.
 In addition, when gelation was carried out in the absence of calcium and magnesium, there were no differences between laser-treated samples and controls.
 The basement membrane proteins were separated by electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels under denaturing plus reducing or denaturing and non-reducing conditions.
 No differences in the polypeptide composition were noted between irradiated and control samples using either Coomassie- or silver-staining techniques.

1746,"Regulatory elements of the erythropoietin gene.
 Because the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B produces erythropoietin (Epo) in a regulated fashion, it can be used to investigate the cis-acting regulatory elements of the Epo gene.
 Comparison of primate and mouse sequences shows strong homology not only in the coding sequence but also within the 5' flanking region, the first intron, and the 3' flanking region.
 These portions of the Epo gene were inserted 5' and 3' to a reporter gene, human growth hormone (GH).
 5A is a 1,192-base pair (bp) HindIII-Xbal fragment that extends from 378 bp 5' to the cap site through the first intron.
 To obviate the problem of false initiation of translation from the Epo ATG start codon, this site was changed to TAG by site-directed mutagenesis.
 3A is a 255-bp Accl-BglII fragment that extends 67 bp upstream from the Epo termination codon and covers most of the 3' noncoding region of homology.
 The plasmid DNAs were transfected by electroporation into Hep3B cells with RSVCAT as an internal standard to correct for transfection efficiency.
 One aliquot of cells was exposed to 50 mumol/L CoCl2 or to 1% O2.
 At the end of the incubations, GH and Epo were measured in the cell media and the cell pellet was assayed for CAT.
 Production of GH was stimulated 1.7-fold by cobalt or hypoxia.
 Furthermore, addition of 3A to the GH gene, irrespective of orientation, stimulated GH production 2.6-fold with CoCl2 and 2.3-fold with hypoxia.
 Stable cell lines were produced by cotransfection of the above constructions, along with the selectable marker pSV-Neo.
 In two clones, exposure to hypoxia resulted in much more marked (16-fold) induction of GH.
 Stimulus of both GH and Epo production by hypoxia was partially abrogated by carbon monoxide.
 These results demonstrate the presence of promoter and enhancer elements within the human Epo gene that are appropriately responsive to hypoxia and cobalt.

 A retrospective analysis was performed to investigate the prognostic value of growth in a human tumor clonogenic assay system for 84 ovarian cancer patients.
 A significant difference in survival probability (determined by the method of Kaplan-Meier) was found by univariate analysis between patients with ovarian carcinoma whose tumors manifested clonogenic growth (defined as growth of greater than or equal to five colonies per plate) and patients whose tumors did not grow.
 Clonogenic growth in vitro was associated with worse prognosis (P = .007, log-rank test).

 Multivariate analysis, based on the Cox regression model, identified clonogenic growth as a significant independent prognostic parameter in ovarian carcinoma (P = .031), in addition to the conventional risk factors.
 Estimation of survival of individual patients was best accomplished by combining the factors of residual tumor mass (P less than .05), age (P less than .01), and clonogenic growth (P less than .05) (in sequence of decreasing potential of risk).

 OBJECTIVE: The relation of poor health to the onset of depression symptoms in late life is well recognized, but little attention has been given to characteristics that might predict persistence or remission of depressive symptoms.
 In previous analyses the authors found that increasing disability and declining health preceded the emergence of depressive symptoms in older community residents and accounted for 70% of the variance explained by discriminant analyses.
 The aim of the present analysis was to examine the relevance of changes in health and disability to the persistence of depressive symptoms.
 METHOD: A representative sample of 1,855 adults aged 65 or older were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at baseline.
 Twenty-four months later, 1,577 individuals were available for a second assessment of depressive symptoms.
 The characteristics of the 97 community residents whose depressive symptoms persisted over 24 months were compared to those of the 114 whose symptoms remitted.
 RESULTS: Changes in health, differences in age, sleep disturbance, and added formal support services accounted for more than 30% of the variance between the persistently depressed and remission groups.
 Advanced age and worsening health were associated with persistent symptoms, improved health with remission.
 CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have indicated that untoward changes in health and disability play a major role in the onset of depressive symptoms.

 Abnormalities in systemic fibrinolysis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of venous ulceration.
 Patients with venous disease have a prolonged euglobulin lysis time and elevated plasma fibrinogen levels, yet little is known about the metabolism of fibrinogen and fibrin in such patients.
 In this study, we have used a technique that involves electrophoresis and densitometric analysis of captured fibrin-related antigens to measure the concentration and proportions of the individual fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products in patients with venous disease of the lower extremity.
 As a group, patients with venous disease had markedly elevated levels of total fibrin-related antigen and D-dimer, the terminal degradation product of cross-linked fibrin.
 Levels of D-monomer, the breakdown product of fibrinogen and non-cross-linked fibrin monomer, and a measure of fibrinogenolysis were normal in all patients.
 In patients with ulcers, the levels of D-dimer were disproportionately higher than expected from fibrin monomer levels.
 On an individual basis, significant elevations of D-dimer were present in six (55%) of the 11 patients with venous disease with ulcers and in three (43%) of the seven patients with venous disease without ulcers.
 We conclude that patients with venous disease have uniform evidence for enhanced fibrin formation, as evidenced by elevated levels of total fibrin-related antigen and D-dimer.
 This is regardless of whether the venous disease is accompanied by ulceration.

 Recombinant human transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was found to inhibit the adhesive phenotype of human umbilical vein endothelial cells for human PBL, purified T lymphocytes, and PHA-activated lymphoblasts.
 TGF-beta inhibited lymphocyte attachment to resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells and also to endothelial monolayers stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta.
 Our investigations also show that the ability of endothelial cells to respond to TGF-beta by altering their adhesiveness is lost with prolonged culture of the cells.
 However, this loss is selective as TGF-beta inhibits cell proliferation in both early and late passage endothelial cells.
 These results suggest that in vivo TGF-beta may inhibit the adhesive phenotype of endothelial cells and also may limit the immunologic response occurring at the endothelial cell barrier.

 Intensive care units (ICUs) are recognized as one of the most expensive services provided by hospitals.

 These patients can be described as ""chronically critically ill"" and are costly to hospitals both in terms of actual dollars and in terms of the burden of care to nurses and physicians.
 This article describes the creation of a special care unit (SCU) designed specifically to meet the needs of chronically critically ill patients.
 The SCU environment is composed of a physical design that accommodates limited technology and care aimed at family involvement and rehabilitation, a case management practice model, and a shared governance management model.
 This structure is in contrast to traditional ICU environments, which include physical layouts that allow for high technology and close monitoring of patients, a primary nursing delivery system, and a bureaucratic management model.

 Critically ill patients often demonstrate that whole body oxygen consumption (VO2) is dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2).
 In this retrospective study, the relationship of VO2 to DO2 in patients with isolated head injury (HI, n = 18) was compared to that in patients with multiple trauma (MT, n = 60) without serious head injury.
 Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, arterial PCO2, cardiac index, and oxygen delivery were significantly lower in HI, but oxygen consumption was not different in the groups.
 In both groups, changes in DO2 (delta DO2) within each patient were significantly correlated with changes in VO2 (delta VO2) in that same patient.
 This relationship was not different between the HI patients, (delta VO2 = (0.20 +/- 0.02) delta DO2), and the MT patients (delta VO2 = (0.17 +/- 0.01) delta DO2).
 When these groups were further divided into those with high hematocrit (greater than 32%) and low hematocrit (less than 32%), HI patients with a low hematocrit demonstrated a steeper regression slope, with 26 +/- 3% of the DO2 change being reflected in the VO2 change.
 This was significantly greater than the slope in HI patients with high hematocrit (13 +/- 3%) and the MT patients at high (19 +/- 2%) or low (16 +/- 2%) hematocrits.
 These data show a correlation between changes in oxygen delivery and consumption that is similar in both head-injury patients and multiple trauma patients without serious head injury.
 This relationship was greatest in head-injured patients at low hematocrit.
 This relationship of VO2 and DO2 in both groups suggests an influence of neurohumoral factors rather than local tissue phenomena.

 Five of the seven animals had histopathologically documented cerebral infarctions of varying size.
 No foreign substance was seen within the blood vessels to suggest intravascular polymerization.
 The animals injected with 2 or 4 cc HEMA solution did not survive 48 hours.
 Literature review reveals little documentation of the toxicology of intravascular HEMA.
 With its increasing popularity as a compound for polymerization in detachable balloons introduced into the brain, further investigations are warranted to understand the physical properties of the compound and potential risks of its use.

1759,"Non-ossicle homograft bone prostheses in the middle ear.
 This thesis proposes the use of human cadaver non-ossicle temporal homograft bone as middle ear reconstructive material.
 Bone obtained from the otic capsule histologically resembles that of the ossicles more so than any other bone in the body.
 The otic capsule, due to its proximity to the middle ear, can be harvested with the middle ear structures when bone cores are obtained, making it easily accessible.
 These prostheses are cost effective because multiple prostheses can be sculptured from one temporal bone core.
 This paper further proposes the use and introduction of non-ossicle homografts in primary stapedectomy, as well as in selected cases to bypass the incus and the superstructure of the stapes.
 Audiological data is provided.
 Some of the grafts have been in the middle ear for up to 5 years.
 There have been no extrusions and no complications.
 The method of harvesting, preservation, and sterilization is presented, as well as a pictorial illustration of the finished product and its relation to the natural ossicles.
 One histological specimen is presented.
 On the basis of the audiologic results, as well as the fact that no ossicles have extruded and none have been resorbed, it is proposed that non-ossicle temporal bone homografts have a place in transplantation surgery.

1760,"Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction limits use of maximum systolic elastance as an index of contractile function.
 We tested the hypothesis that maximum systolic elastance (Emax) fails to detect a decline in left ventricular (LV) contractile function when diastolic dysfunction is present.
 Canine hearts were studied in an isolated blood-perfused heart apparatus (isovolumic LV); contractile dysfunction was produced by 60 or 90 minutes of global ischemia, followed by 90 minutes of reperfusion.
 Nine normal hearts underwent 60 minutes of ischemia, and five underwent 90 minutes of ischemia.
 After the ischemia-reperfusion sequence, developed pressure, pressure-volume area, and myocardial ATP level were significantly less than those at baseline in all 14 hearts.
 In the group undergoing 60 minutes of ischemia, LV diastolic pressure did not increase, whereas Emax decreased from 5.2 +/- 2.5 to 2.9 +/- 1.4 mm Hg/ml (p less than 0.05).
 In the group undergoing 90 minutes of ischemia, diastolic pressure increased (from 10 +/- 2 to 37 +/- 20 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), and Emax did not change significantly (from 5.1 +/- 4.3 to 4.3 +/- 2.5 mm Hg/ml).
 A second series of experiments was performed in 13 hearts with pressure-overload hypertrophy (aortic-band model with echocardiography and catheterization studies before the ischemia-reperfusion protocol).
 Five had evidence for pump failure, whereas eight remained compensated.
 After 60 minutes of ischemia and 90 minutes of reperfusion, developed pressure, pressure-volume area, and myocardial ATP level were significantly less than those at baseline in all 13 hearts.
 In the group with compensated LV hypertrophy, LV diastolic pressure did not change, whereas Emax decreased from 6.9 +/- 3.0 to 3.1 +/- 2.3 mm Hg/ml (p less than 0.05).

1761,"Preferential localization of human adherent lymphokine-activated killer cells in tumor microcirculation.
 The efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy for solid tumors with lymphokine-activated effector cells presumably depends on the ability of these cells to localize adequately in tumor tissues.
 We present here the first quantitative study of the in vivo movement of fluorescently labeled adherent lymphokine-activated killer (A-LAK) cells.
 These cells were injected intra-arterially along with low-dose interleukin-2 into normal (mature granulation) tissue and an implant of VX2 carcinoma grown in the rabbit ear chamber.
 A small proportion of A-LAK cells accumulated preferentially in the tumor microcirculation in vivo because of an increased frequency of long-term adhesive interactions with the tumor vasculature.
 Stasis of blood flow in the tumor vasculature was observed 1 to 2 days after injection.
 Subsequent necrosis of the tumors was observed, along with diffuse infiltrates of lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes in the interstitial space within the tumor.
 Development of necrosis despite low ratios of effector cells to target cells suggests that in addition to direct cytotoxicity, the response to adoptive immunotherapy is mediated via the tumor vasculature.
 This novel mechanism for adoptive immunotherapy must be taken into account in the development of improved strategies for cancer treatment.

 We measured squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) in epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal in 66 patients.
 Samples were taken at diagnosis, before treatment, and during follow-up; 353 samples were analyzed.
 The positive threshold was taken as 2 ng/ml.
 At diagnosis, the sensitivity of the marker was 44 percent and its specificity 92 percent.
 In our series, the pretherapeutic level of SCC does not correlate with T as in Papillons' Clinical Staging System, but it does correlate with nodal invasion (P less than 0.05).
 It is of no prognostic value at the time of diagnosis.
 During follow-up, at relapse the level of SCC is 20.3 +/- 43 ng/ml.
 This increase is significant (P less than 0.01): the sensitivity of the marker is 77 percent.
 In patients who have relapsed, development of the illness correlates with the level of SCC, which is of prognostic value (P less than 0.01).
 In conclusion, the level of SCC should be associated with the clinical follow-up of patients with epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal.

1763,"Protein synthesis required to anchor a mutant p53 protein which is temperature-sensitive for nuclear transport.
 The p53 protein is rendered temperature-sensitive by a point mutation.
 Rat cells transformed by this mutant p53 and an activated ras oncogene grow well at 37 degrees C but cease DNA synthesis and cell division when shifted to 32 degrees C.
 Immunostaining demonstrates that the mutant p53 protein is in the nucleus of the arrested cells at 32 degrees C but in the cytoplasm of the growing cells at 37 degrees C.
 This is the first example of a protein which is temperature-sensitive for nuclear transport.
 The translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus and vice versa occurs 6 h after temperature shift and is coincident with the inhibition of DNA synthesis; transport from cytoplasm to nucleus does not require protein synthesis.
 Remarkably, inhibition of protein synthesis at 37 degrees C also results in the rapid appearance of mutant p53 in the cell nucleus.
 These results suggest the presence of a short-lived protein responsible for holding p53 in the cytoplasm at 37 degrees C but not at 32 degrees C.
 Analysis of a non-temperature-sensitive mutant p53 protein shows that its cytoplasmic location is sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors but not to temperature.

 The axial torque until failure of the ligamentous occipito-atlanto-axial complex (C0-C1-C2) subjected to axial angular rotation (theta) was characterized using a biaxial MTS system.
 A special fixture and gearbox that permitted right axial rotation of the specimen until failure without imposing any additional constraints were designed to obtain the data.
 The average values for the axial rotation and torque at the point of maximum resistance were, respectively, 68.1 degrees and 13.6 N-m.
 The specimens offered minimal resistance (approximately 0.5 N-m), up to an average axial rotation of 21 degrees across the complex.
 The torque-angular rotation (T-theta) curve can be divided into four regions: regions of least and steadily increasing resistances, a transition zone that connects these two regions, and the increasing resistance region to the point of maximum resistance.
 The regions of least and steadily increasing resistances may be represented by two straight lines with average slopes of 0.028 and 0.383 N-m/degree, respectively.
 Post-test dissection of the specimens disclosed the following.
 The point of maximum resistance corresponded roughly to the value of axial rotation at which complete bilateral rotary dislocation of the C1-C2 facets occurred.
 The types of injuries observed were related to the magnitude of axial rotation imposed on a specimen during testing.
 Soft-tissue injuries alone (like stretch/rupture of the capsular ligaments, subluxation of the C1-C2 facets, etc.) were confined to specimens rotated up to or close to the point of maximum resistance.
 The specimens that were subjected to rotations up to the point of maximum resistance of the curve spontaneously reduced completely on removal from the testing apparatus.
 Spontaneous reduction was not possible for specimens tested slightly beyond their points of maximum resistance.

1765,"Red cell antibodies arising from solid organ transplants.
 RBC antibodies arising from transplanted organs and directed against recipient RBCs represent a well-established immunohematologic complication of solid organ transplantation.
 In ABO-unmatched organs, the frequency and severity of graft antibodies and hemolysis generally increase with the size (lymphoid content) of the organ, from kidney to liver to heart-lung transplants.
 In the cases reviewed here, the frequency of hemolysis increased in cyclosporine-treated kidney transplant recipients and O-to-A liver transplant recipients and decreased in group AB liver transplant recipients and kidney transplant recipients receiving azathioprine or low-dose postoperative graft irradiation.
 Available data cannot otherwise distinguish which cyclosporine-treated recipients of ABO-unmatched kidneys and livers (30-40% of total) will develop graft antibody.
 There has been no conclusive effect to date of the age, race, or gender of the donor or the recipient, of cadaver versus living kidney donors, or of patients' A2 or secretor status.
 In a few cases of living-donor kidney grafts, the donor was the patient's mother or wife who had been exposed to the recipient's RBC antigens via pregnancy.
 The ABO antibodies are typically IgG, appear 7 to 10 days after transplantation, and last for about a month.
 If immediate-spin crossmatching is done routinely, DATs are recommended in compatibility testing after ABO-unmatched transplants.
 Changes in the immunosuppressive regimen, such as a change from cyclosporine therapy, have not affected the duration of these antibodies.
 Most patients require only transfusions for this self-limited process, but six cases of hemolysis-induced acute renal failure have been reported, and one death was attributed to complications of hemolysis.
 RBC or plasma exchange has been performed in a few fulminant cases.
 RBCs of the donor's blood type are given when antibody appears.
 Some workers recommend such transfusion as prophylaxis at the time of surgery, although in liver transplants, the plasma accompanying a large amount of group O RBCs given perioperatively might be problematic.
 In several other centers, ABO-unmatched liver transplants have equivalent overall graft survivals, but the Pittsburgh adult patients with hemolysis have had reduced early graft survival.
 In the cases reviewed here, nine IgG Rh antibodies from kidney grafts directed against recipient RBCs have been observed, usually beginning 2 to 3 weeks after a cyclosporine-treated transplant, lasting for 2 to 6 months after operation, and causing mild hemolysis.
 One case represented a primary immune response from a previously unsensitized donor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

 The cancer cells continued to proliferate from the 3rd to the 7th day after the implantation and then decreased.
 The host reaction was recognized histologically from the 3rd or 4th day to the 9th day.
 However, the immune reaction did not significantly influence the evaluation of SRCA until the 7th day.
 The immunohistochemical staining with anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody revealed the existence of cancer cells at the DNA synthesizing stage (S stage) in the graft until the 7th day.

 To identify the symptoms and coexisting medical conditions associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), we administered an 83-item questionnaire at the time of diagnosis to 50 IIH patients and 100 aged-matched controls.
 Ninety percent of the IIH patients were women; the mean age was 33.
 Obesity and recent weight gain were much more common among patients than controls.
 Symptoms most commonly reported by IIH patients were headache (94%), transient visual obscurations (TVO) (68%), and intracranial noises (ICN) (58%).
 Daily occurrence of these symptoms was much more common among patients than controls.
 Controls also reported these and other IIH symptoms, but at lower frequencies.
 Several conditions previously associated with IIH were no more common in patients than controls including iron deficiency anemia, thyroid disease, pregnancy, antibiotic intake, and use of oral contraceptives.
 We conclude that previous studies of IIH, mostly uncontrolled and retrospective, have underestimated the frequency of symptoms in IIH patients and reported chance and spurious associations with common medical conditions and medications.
 The profile of a young obese woman with headaches and either TVO or ICN should alert the clinician to the diagnosis of IIH, especially when the symptoms occur daily.

 OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of cocaine exposure among preschool children with clinically unsuspected signs and/or symptoms.
 DESIGN: Prevalence study.
 SETTING: Pediatric emergency department in an inner-city hospital.
 PARTICIPANTS: 250 children aged 2 weeks to 5 years who underwent urine assays for cocaine prior to discharge from the emergency department.
 INTERVENTIONS: None.
 MEASUREMENTS/MAIN RESULTS: Six (2.4%) of the 250 urine assays (95% confidence interval, 0.5% to 4.3%) were positive for benzoylecgonine, the major urinary cocaine metabolite.
 Four of the positive urine assays were from children younger than 1 year and all children with positive urine assays were younger than 24 months.
 None of these children presented with a complaint or was identified as having clinical problems currently associated with childhood exposure to cocaine.
 Possible exposure routes include breastfeeding, intentional administration, accidental ingestion of cocaine or cocaine-contaminated household dust via normal hand-to-mouth activity, and passive inhalation of ""crack"" vapors.
 CONCLUSION: Among the inner-city children served by this hospital, significant numbers of infants and young children are being exposed to cocaine, and this exposure occurs in a clinically unsuspected population.

1769,"Deprivation in infancy or in adult life: which is more important for mortality risk? 
 Previous ecological studies have suggested that early life factors are important causes of adult cardiovascular and respiratory disease, by showing geographic correlations between past infant mortality rates and present adult mortality rates.
 However, these studies inadequately take account of the fact that areas which were severely deprived earlier this century remain the most deprived today.
 Thus the ecological relation between infant and adult mortality rates could simply reflect persistence in the geographic distribution of poor socioeconomic circumstances.
 To explore this hypothesis further infant mortality rates for 1895-1908 for 43 counties in England and Wales were correlated with cause-specific adult mortality for 1969-73 in people aged 65-74 years, with and without adjustment for present-day social deprivation and social class.
 The strong simple correlations found between infant mortality in 1895-1908 and adult mortality from various causes in 1969-73 were generally much attenuated or abolished by controlling for indices of present-day socioeconomic circumstances.
 Our results suggest that previous studies give no strong support for any direct influence of factors acting in early life on adult coronary heart disease mortality risk.
 Studies which gather data about infancy, childhood, and the full course of adult life are required to clarify this issue.

 Persons' recent life changes, as well as the degree of upset they experienced as a result of these changes, were included.
 Interviews with 715 histologically confirmed new cases of colorectal cancer occurring over a 12-month period in Melbourne, Australia, and with 727 age and sex matched community controls were conducted.
 As one of the methods of assessing any effect of recall bias, 179 hospital controls were also investigated.
 Major illness or death of a family member, major family problems and major work problems were found to be significantly more common for cases over the 5 years preceding diagnosis compared to controls.
 Cases also reported being significantly more upset with their recent life changes than did controls.
 No significant differences in results were found between males and females, or between colon cancer and rectal cancer patients.
 Although the possibility of recall bias, was not completely controlled for in this study, it was probably not an important factor in explaining case-control differences.
 Recent life changes, and their perceptions, may have significance in the development of large bowel cancer.

 The pedigrees were constructed of 43 patients (probands) who underwent resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 Seven probands (16.2%) had a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) known to have had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (multiplex family).
 To determine the prevalence of undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm, ultrasound screening of first-degree relatives over age 40 years was undertaken.
 Of 202 eligible relatives, 103 (51.0%) were screened.
 An occult abdominal aortic aneurysm was defined as an infrarenal aortic diameter greater than 3.0 cm or an infrarenal/suprarenal aortic diameter ratio of greater than 1.5.
 An incipient abdominal aortic aneurysm was defined as a clear focal bulge of the infrarenal aorta, which was less than 3.0 cm in greatest diameter.
 Four of 103 relatives (3.9%) were found to have an occult abdominal aortic aneurysm (age/sex: 57M, 60M, 62F, 65M), and three (2.9%) were found with an incipient abdominal aortic aneurysm (age/sex: 56M, 60M, 67F).
 These smaller abdominal aortic aneurysms were in patients younger than the operated probands (average age men, 67 years; women, 69 years).
 Six of seven individuals were in families previously considered simplex, increasing the actual multiplex family frequency from 16.2% to 27.9%.
 All seven new abdominal aortic aneurysms were found in the 49 siblings age 55 years or older.
 There were no abdominal aortic aneurysms found in the 39 relatives under age 55 years, in 14 children ages 50 to 59 years or in one parent.

1773,"Myocardial perfusion-contraction matching. Implications for coronary heart disease and hibernation.
 Experimental studies demonstrate that short-term regional perfusion-contraction matching, in which the energy demands of regional myocardial contraction are reduced to match the diminished myocardial substrate supply, occurs during states of low coronary blood flow under resting conditions and during exercise-induced ischemia.
 This phenomenon is rapidly reversible and appears to occur in several clinical settings.
 Sustained perfusion-contraction matching is observed in states of partial experimental ischemia of intermediate duration lasting several hours.
 This condition might be called short-term hibernation and resembles clinical conditions such as unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction with some residual perfusion in which the contractile defect can be improved by reperfusion provided the ischemia is not severe enough to cause transmural necrosis.
 Such experimental and clinical observations may or may not relate to the setting of regional dysfunction at rest in patients with chronic coronary heart disease, in whom manifestations of acute ischemia may be absent but improvement of wall motion abnormalities occurs after CABG or balloon angioplasty.
 This condition may constitute the hypothetical state of chronic myocardial hibernation, for which tentative evidence exists from metabolic and perfusion studies using PET.
 Whether such a condition of prolonged perfusion-contraction matching might be associated with adaptive processes that could allow its persistence for long periods without manifest ischemia remains to be investigated.

 Preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy, myocardial damage in the absence of overt congestive heart failure in chronic alcoholics, is well characterized at necropsy, but attempts to identify such a clinical entity before death have produced conflicting results.
 Studying subjects only at rest, the inclusion of older alcoholics and limitations of noninvasive techniques may explain some of the disagreement.
 To determine if preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy could be identified independent of the aforementioned limitations, 25 asymptomatic chronic alcoholics aged less than 40 years (mean 34), each of whom had consumed a minimum of 1 pint of whiskey or one 6-pack of beer greater than or equal to 5 days per week for greater than or equal to 5 years, underwent radionuclide ventriculography for measurements of systolic and diastolic function at rest, peak supine exercise and during recovery, and echocardiography for assessment of chamber size, wall thickness and left ventricular mass.
 Red blood cell levels of selenium and thiamine were measured to determine whether abnormalities were present in these 2 potential mediators of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.
 For comparison, an age-matched group of healthy control subjects was also studied.
 For alcoholics and control subjects at rest, mean ejection fraction (67 +/- 7% vs 71 +/- 6%) and diastolic peak filling rate (3.4 +/- 0.6 vs 3.3 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic volumes per second [EDV/s]) were similar.

 In the absence of more effective treatment for advanced tumors, early diagnosis and treatment of localized tumors is the most effective way of reducing the burden of illness associated with melanoma.
 This study examined the following factors: prevalence of signs of melanoma (a mole changing in size, shape, appearance, or color, itching or tingling, bleeding or weeping, becoming raised) in 1344 individuals in a randomly selected sample of 1075 households; the length of delay in seeking medical advice; the factors associated with either going to a medical practitioner or not going/delaying; and the actions of the medical practitioners when first presented with these signs.
 The results indicate that a large proportion of the sample (11.9%, n = 156) had observed signs of melanoma in the previous 12 months.
 Of the sample reporting signs that had first appeared in the previous 5 years, only 32% sought medical advice about the signs within the recommended period.

 Coronary arterial remodeling is a compensatory mechanism that may limit the adverse effects of coronary obstructive lesions by expansion of the entire vascular segment.
 To determine if this compensatory anatomic change occurs in patients, high-frequency epicardial echocardiography using a 12 MHz transducer was performed during open heart surgery in 33 patients (10 with normal coronary arteries undergoing valvular surgery and 23 with coronary atherosclerosis).
 From stop-frame videotape high-frequency epicardial echocardiographic images, cross-sectional measurements of luminal area and total arterial area (lumen, intima, media and dense adventitia) were made in the patients with atherosclerosis at the site of arterial lesions and from the most proximal portion of the same artery.
 Remodeling was defined as enlargement of the total arterial area.
 In normal arteries measurements were made from proximal and midarterial locations.
 In the patients with normal coronary arteries, total arterial area, as determined by high-frequency echocardiography, decreased from the proximal site to the midportion of the artery (from 10.4 +/- 0.9 to 8.4 +/- 1.0 mm2, p less than 0.05); luminal area also decreased (from 6.0 +/- 0.6 to 4.5 +/- 0.7 mm2, p less than 0.05).

 OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of endothelin-1, a potent endothelial-derived vasoconstrictor peptide, in pulmonary hypertension, by measuring its concentration in arterial and venous plasma.
 DESIGN: A survey, case series study.
 SETTING: University-affiliated hospitals and outpatient clinics.
 PATIENTS: Twenty-seven patients with pulmonary hypertension: 7 with primary, and 20 with secondary pulmonary hypertension of various causes.
 The control groups (n = 16) comprised 8 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with coronary artery disease but without evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly increased (94/43 +/- 23/13 mm Hg) in the patients with pulmonary hypertension.
 Venous plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1, measured by a specific radioimmunoassay, was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary hypertension (3.5 +/- 2.5 pg/mL, P less than 0.001) than in normal subjects (1.45 +/- 0.45 pg/mL), or patients with coronary disease (0.75 +/- 0.64 pg/mL).
 The arterial-to-venous ratio of immunoreactive endothelin-1 was significantly greater than unity in primary pulmonary hypertension (2.21 +/- 0.72, P = 0.01), whereas the patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension had a mean ratio not different from 1 (0.97 +/- 0.42).
 In contrast, the mean arterial-to-venous ratios were significantly less than unity in both control groups (0.59 +/- 0.35, and 0.54 +/- 0.64; P less than 0.02, for normal subjects and coronary disease patients, respectively), indicating a possible clearance of endothelin-1 across the healthy lung.
 CONCLUSIONS: Patient with pulmonary hypertension have substantial alterations in plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1, which may reflect changes in net release or clearance of endothelin-1 by the lung.
 In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, the high levels in arterial compared with venous plasma suggest pulmonary production of endothelin-1, which may contribute to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.

 The intention of this study was to characterize angiotensin I-forming angiotensinogenases (AIFAs) in rat extrarenal arterial walls and to clarify whether these enzymes are also present in the kidney.
 A further aim was to identify AIFAs in human vasculature and to establish whether they are affected in essential hypertension.
 Sprague-Dawley rats and vascular sections of patients undergoing corrective surgery were studied.
 Enzyme kinetic assays were performed using angiotensin I radioimmunoassay and purified natural angiotensinogens.
 Fast protein liquid chromatography was employed for biochemical characterization.
 A series of AIFAs with various isoelectric points, molecular weights and pH optima was detected in rat extrarenal vascular and, with differing distributions of enzyme activities, in renal tissues.
 In extrarenal arteries the main form of renal renin was present with a relatively low activity only.
 AIFAs were also demonstrable in human extrarenal vasculature and behaved like plasma renin in essential hypertension.
 The results indicate the existence of an intrinsic human vascular RAS in extrarenal (and renal) arteries.

 Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in most developed countries.
 Therefore, elucidation of risk factors and associated mechanisms for CAD has been a high priority.
 Data from the Framingham Heart Study and other large-scale epidemiologic studies have identified major risk factors associated with CAD, demonstrating the adverse effects of increased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the protective effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
 Other more recent investigations, including the Lipid Research Clinics Trial and the Helsinki Heart Study, have shown that lowering total cholesterol and raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly reduce the risk for CAD.
 Because hypertension is also a significant risk factor for CAD, the assumption has been that blood pressure reduction should offer significant benefits in terms of CAD risk.
 However, despite their antihypertensive efficacy, diuretics and beta blockers have failed to significantly reduce CAD morbidity or mortality.
 The adverse effects of these antihypertensive agents on lipid profiles, glucose metabolism and other metabolic parameters may account for their disappointing performance in reducing CAD morbidity and mortality.
 As a result, newer agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists that appear to be free of such adverse effects have garnered considerable attention for their potential to reduce CAD risk.

1783,"Epilepsy with continuous spike-waves during slow sleep and its treatment.
 Five children with epilepsy with ""continuous spike-waves during slow sleep"" (CSWS) are reported.
 The main clinical features of CSWS include (a) onset between 5 and 7 years of age, (b) the occurrence of several types of seizure (i.e., partial motor, generalized motor, and atypical absence), and (c) the presence of language disturbances and abnormal behavior based on emotional impairment.
 The EEG findings were characterized by sleep tracings showing almost continuous (greater than 95%), diffuse slow spike and wave activity.
 After treatment with valproate (VPA) (or ethosuximide, ESM) and clonazepam (CZP), the spike and wave complex status disappeared.
 Symptoms and signs of the CSWS also decreased.
 We suggest that combined treatment is an appropriate treatment for CSWS.

1784,"Cognitive and behavioural impairment among elderly people in institutions providing different levels of care.
 OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence and degree of cognitive and behavioural impairment in elderly patients in institutions providing different levels of care.
 DESIGN: Prevalence study.
 SETTING: A nursing home, a home for the aged and psychogeriatric wards in a provincial psychiatric hospital.
 PATIENTS: Only subjects 65 years of age or older were eligible for inclusion.
 A random sample was selected comprising 25% of the residents in the nursing home and the home for the aged; of the 119 asked to participate 95 agreed (44 in the nursing home and 51 in the home for the aged).
 All 50 on the psychogeriatric wards agreed to participate.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Kingston Dementia Rating Scale (KDRS).
 RESULTS: An MMSE score of less than 24 (cognitive impairment) was given to 37 (84%) of the residents in the nursing home, 43 (84%) of those in the home for the aged and 48 (96%) of the patients in the psychiatric hospital; the corresponding numbers for a KDRS score of more than 0 (cognitive impairment) were 41 (93%), 48 (94%) and 50 (100%).
 The seven patients receiving the highest level of care at the home for the aged (special care) had more behavioural problems than those in the psychiatric hospital did (p less than 0.001).
 CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and behavioural impairment was widespread in the three institutions regardless of the level of care.
 When planning services and allocating resources government funding agencies should consider the degree and prevalence of such impairment among elderly people in institutions.

1785,"Effect of atenolol and diltiazem on heart period variability in normal persons.
 Several time and frequency domain measures of heart period variability are reduced 1 to 2 weeks after myocardial infarction, and a reduced standard deviation of normal RR intervals over a 24 h period (SDNN) is associated with increased mortality.
 The predictive accuracy of heart period variability may be reduced by drugs used to treat patients after myocardial infarction.
 Accordingly, a randomized, three period, placebo-controlled, crossover (Latin square) design was used to determine the effect of atenolol and diltiazem on time and frequency measures of heart period variability calculated from 24 h continuous electrocardiographic recordings during treatment with atenolol, diltiazem and placebo in 18 normal volunteers.
 During atenolol treatment, the 24 h average normal RR (NN) interval increased 24% (p less than 0.001).
 The three measures of tonic vagal activity were significantly increased (p less than 0.001) during atenolol treatment: percent of successive normal RR intervals greater than 50 ms = 69%, root mean square successive difference of normal RR intervals = 61% and high frequency power in the heart period power spectrum = 84%.
 Low frequency power also increased 45% (p less than 0.01), indicating that this variable also is an indicator of tonic vagal activity over 24 h.
 Diltiazem had no significant effect on the 24 h average NN interval or on any measure of heart period variability.
 The decreased mortality rate after myocardial infarction associated with beta-adrenergic blocker but not calcium channel blocker therapy may be attributed in part to an increase in vagal tone caused by beta-blockers.

 TCA3 is a cDNA originally isolated from activated T cells.
 Transcription of this gene has been shown to correlate with Ag-induced cellular activation of both T cells and mast cells.
 Based on the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA, we previously proposed that TCA3 represents a cytokine.
 In this report we have used rDNA technology to express TCA3 in two mammalian cell lines.
 In both cases, TCA3 was expressed as a secreted molecule with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa.
 Digestion of the (rTCA3) with the enzyme N-glycanase revealed that approximately 8 kDa is caused by N-linked glycosylation.
 Intradermal injection of rTCA3 into mouse footpads resulted in a rapid swelling response.
 The sites of injection were characterized histologically by a local accumulation of neutrophils.
 These findings are discussed with particular attention to a family of related proteins, some of whose members also have inflammatory properties.

 This study sought to determine if individuals with high-normal blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure of 85-89 mm Hg) progress to hypertension more frequently than those with normal blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure less than 85 mm Hg), thus advancing to a higher cardiovascular risk category.
 Individuals from the Framingham Heart Study were placed in normal and high-normal blood pressure categories and followed for 26 years for the development of hypertension.
 With hypertension defined as a diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg or greater or the initiation of antihypertensive therapy, 23.6% of men and 36.2% of women with normal blood pressure developed hypertension compared with 54.2% of men and 60.6% of women with high-normal blood pressure.
 The relative risk for the development of hypertension associated with high-normal blood pressure was 2.25 for men (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-2.8; p less than 0.0001) and 1.89 for women (95% CI, 1.5-2.3; p less than 0.0001).
 The age-adjusted relative risks estimated by the proportional hazards model were 3.36 for men and 3.37 for women (p less than 0.001).
 Among those risk factors examined, baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Metropolitan relative weight, and change in weight over time were significant predictors of future hypertension in men and women whose initial blood pressure was normal.
 For men with high-normal blood pressure, systolic blood pressure and change in weight were identified as risk factors for future hypertension.
 These results indicate that the probability of individuals with blood pressure in the high-normal range developing hypertension is twofold to threefold higher than in those with normal blood pressure.

 Respiratory symptoms and function were examined in a random sample of 181 farmers (124 pig farmers and 57 dairy farmers) with a mean age of 43 years.
 Wheezing and shortness of breath during work in the animal house were significantly associated with pig farming (odds ratio 11.4), current smoking (odds ratio 2.2), bronchial hyperreactivity (odds ratio 3.8), and low FEV1 (odds ratio 3.4).
 Pig farmers had a slightly lower FEV1 than dairy farmers (101% versus 104% predicted, NS).
 Symptomatic farmers had significantly lower FEV1 than symptomless farmers (93% versus 106% predicted).
 A multiple linear regression analysis of the cross sectional values of FEV1 showed that there was a decline in FEV1 associated with pig farming (-12 ml/year of pig farming) and smoking (-23 ml/pack year) in addition to the age related decline of 32 ml/year.
 A multiple linear regression analysis of PC20 histamine showed that bronchial reactivity increased with age, number of pack years, and number of years in pig farming.

1792,"Formation of the 37KD protein-acetaldehyde adduct in liver during alcohol treatment is dependent on alcohol dehydrogenase activity.
 Protein-acetaldehyde adducts (protein-AAs) are formed in vivo during chronic alcohol ingestion.
 These protein-AAs reported thus far include a 37KD protein-AA in liver cytosol, cytP450IIE 1-AA in hepatic microsomes, hemoglobin-AA, and serum protein-AAs.
 It has been postulated that acetaldehyde or perhaps a reactive acetaldehyde radical generated by the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS or cytP450IIE1) explains the formation of the cytP450IIE1-AA.
 The source of acetaldehyde responsible for the formation of the cytosolic 37KD protein-AA has not been determined.
 In this report, we have examined the effects of pyrazole (an ADH inhibitor) and cyanamide (an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor) on the formation of the 37KD liver protein-AA in vivo and in vitro.
 It was found that feeding rats with an alcohol-containing liquid diet supplemented with cyanamide enhanced while a diet supplemented with pyrazole completely abolished the formation of the 37KD liver protein-AA.
 The liver of rats fed the pyrazole supplemented alcohol-containing diet showed significantly higher content of cytP450IIE1 than that of rats fed the diet containing alcohol alone.
 On the other hand, feeding the cyanamide supplemented alcohol-containing liquid diet did not further enhance the content of cytP450IIE1.
 Similarly, adding cyanamide to the culture medium enhanced while adding 4-methylpyrazole inhibited the production of the 37KD protein-AA by cultured hepatocytes even though the combination of alcohol and 4-methylpyrazole increased the content of cytP450IIE1 2-fold over that in control cells.
 These results demonstrate that the formation of the 37KD liver Protein-AA is dependent on ADH and not on MEOS.

1794,"In vivo ultraviolet irradiation of human skin results in profound perturbation of the immune system. Relevance to ultraviolet-induced skin cancer [published erratum appears in Arch Dermatol 1991 Sep;127(9):1368]
 Ultraviolet exposure of human skin deletes the function of antigen-presenting Langerhans cells normally resident within the epidermis.
 Langerhans cells are capable of activating T-lymphocytes by presenting antigens (such as nickel or tumor antigens) to T-lymphocytes.
 Such activated T-lymphocytes may be involved in the development of contact dermatitis and the immune surveillance of immunogenic skin cancers.
 Deletion of the function of Langerhans cells does not result in abrogated epidermal antigen presentation since ultraviolet irradiation simultaneously induces the appearance of another epidermal antigen-presenting cell population that is distinct from the Langerhans cell population and seems to induce suppression of the immune response.
 Suppression of the immune response following ultraviolet irradiation in murine models is critical for growth of immunogenic ultraviolet-induced skin neoplasm.
 Thus, ultraviolet irradiation of human skin may facilitate the growth of human neoplasms, and the spreading of skin-associated infections due to induction of suppressor T cells.

 The hemodynamic effects of selective inhibition of arginine vasopressin (AVP) with a V1 antagonist, (CH2)5yreAVPa CL-1-4A, were studied in normal rats (n = 17) and in rats 4 weeks after coronary artery ligation with large myocardial infarctions and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (n = 22).
 In normal rats AVP inhibition with a 35-micrograms/kg bolus of AVP V1 antagonist did not change heart rate, right atrial, left ventricular systolic, left ventricular end-diastolic or aortic pressures.
 There were also no changes in mean circulatory filling pressure, unstressed vascular volume, blood volume or venous compliance.
 In rats with infarction and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, AVP inhibition did not change heart rate, right atrial pressure, mean circulatory filling pressure or blood volume, but mean aortic pressure decreased from 103 +/- 3 to 88 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than .001), venous compliance increased (P less than .001) from 2.17 +/- 0.07 to 3.04 +/- 0.11 ml/mm Hg/kg and unstressed vascular volume decreased from 42.3 +/- 3.1 to 34.7 +/- 2.6 ml/kg (P less than .05).
 We conclude that inhibition of AVP with a specific V1 antagonist had no effect on the venous or arterial circulations in normal rats, but in rats with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure after chronic myocardial infarction, AVP inhibition decreased arterial pressure and caused venodilatation.

 The role of intravenous infusion of glucose in limiting ketogenesis and the effect of glucose on cerebral metabolism following severe head injury were studied in 21 comatose patients.
 The patients were randomly assigned to alimentation with or without glucose.
 Systemic protein wasting, arterial concentrations of energy substrates, and cerebral metabolism of these energy substrates were monitored for 5 days postinjury.
 Both groups were in negative nitrogen balance, and had wasting of systemic proteins despite substantial protein intake.
 Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose concentrations were highest on Day 1, but remained higher than normal fasting levels on all days of study, even in the patients who received no exogenous glucose.
 Although there were no differences in blood or CSF glucose concentrations in the two groups of patients, the glucose group had higher plasma insulin levels, with a mean +/- standard deviation of 14.8 +/- 7.3 microU/ml compared to 10.3 +/- 4.2 microU/ml in the saline group.
 The blood concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, pyruvate, glycerol, and the free fatty acids were higher in the saline group than in the glucose group.
 Cerebral oxygen consumption was similar in the two groups, while the cerebral metabolism of glucose and of the ketone bodies was dependent on whether glucose was administered.
 In the glucose group, glucose was the only energy substrate utilized by the brain.
 In the saline group, the ketone bodies beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate replaced glucose to the extent of 16% of the brain's total energy production.
 Cerebral lactate production and CSF lactate concentration were lower in the saline group.
 These studies suggest that administration of glucose during the early recovery period of severe head injury is a major cause of suppressed ketogenesis, and may increase production of lactic acid by the traumatized brain by limiting the availability of nonglycolytic energy substrates.

 Focal abnormalities that were consistent with lesion location were present in the topographically analyzed EEG or VEP of 85% of the patients, compared with a 70% detection rate for conventional analysis techniques.
 Quantitative analysis of spectrally analyzed EEG revealed focal abnormality in 7 patients whose conventional EEG was interpreted as either normal or diffusely slow.
 However, focal paroxysmal spikes present in the EEG of 1 patient were missed by EEG mapping, and a false localization of quantitative EEG abnormality contralateral to the lesion occurred in 1 patient.

 In all four patients attempts were made to repair the rotator cuff.
 In each case the repair failed and the humeral head migrated.
 Two of the patients had the humeral head replaced because of a fracture; in these patients the prosthesis displaced upwards.

 The influence of desflurane on myocardial perfusion measured by a microsphere technique during a total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and concomitant moderate or severe stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery was evaluated in chronically instrumented dogs.
 Hemodynamics, regional contractile function, and myocardial blood flow were measured during the conscious state and after anesthesia with desflurane (8.2%-9.2% and 12.5%-12.7%) with and without control of arterial pressure.
 Total left anterior descending occlusion produced in combination with a left circumflex coronary artery stenosis significantly (P less than 0.05) increased heart rate and left ventricular end diastolic pressure in the absence of desflurane anesthesia.
 Desflurane, administered only in the presence of left anterior descending occlusion and left circumflex stenosis, significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased mean arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, and left ventricular positive dP/dt50 without change in heart rate.
 Blood flow to the subendocardium of normal myocardium was reduced during the high concentration of desflurane (P less than 0.05), but perfusion of the subepicardium and midmyocardium was maintained at conscious levels.
 When the left circumflex stenosis was of moderate severity, only blood flow to the subendocardium distal to the stenosis was reduced by desflurane (P less than 0.05).
 In the presence of a severe stenosis, perfusion was decreased in the subepicardium, midmyocardium, and subendocardium of the stenotic zone (P less than 0.05).
 During the reduction in arterial pressure produced by desflurane, collateral blood flow in the left anterior descending region was reduced in dogs with either a moderate or severe left circumflex stenosis (P less than 0.05).
 When arterial pressure and heart rate conditions observed in the postocclusion conscious state were restored during the high concentration of desflurane, myocardial blood flow in all regions returned to those levels present in the conscious state (P less than 0.05).
 Ratios of flow between occluded and normal zones were decreased when hypotension produced by desflurane was uncontrolled, but when arterial pressure and heart rate were adjusted to conscious postocclusion levels using partial thoracic aorta occlusion and atrial pacing, the ratio remained at conscious control levels regardless of the degree of left circumflex stenosis severity (P less than 0.05).

1811,"Effect of Bay U 3405, a new thromboxane antagonist, on collagen-induced thromboembolism in rabbits.
 Bay U 3405 [(3R)-3-(4-fluorophenylsulfonamido)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9- carbazolepropanoic acid] potently inhibits platelet aggregation, thromboxane A2-induced contraction of smooth muscles, and coronary artery thrombosis.
 We have previously demonstrated inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced sudden death by Bay U 3405.
 The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Bay U 3405 on thromboembolism provoked by collagen.
 Collagen fibrils dissolved in an isotonic glucose solution were injected into a marginal ear vein of anesthetized rabbits.
 Sudden death occurred within a few minutes due to elevated thromboxane A2 levels causing intravascular platelet aggregation and myocardial ischemia.
 In the vehicle-treated group, 100% of the animals died.
 One of the most prominent parameters was the massive fall in blood pressure.
 All animals pretreated with 10 mg/kg orally Bay U 3405 survived, showing only a transient hypotensive effect.
 Tracings of the electrocardiogram and heart rate were unchanged.
 Bay U 3405 will therefore be useful to elucidate the role of thromboxane A2 in various cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.

 Ninety-one patients receiving routine dental treatment at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry participated in an electrocardiogram screening study.
 The purpose of the study was to evaluate patient reaction to electrocardiogram screening in a dental school clinic.
 The vast majority of patients indicated the test was easy and did not intrude on the dental appointment.
 Most of the patients reported that the test was a valuable service and should be available in the dental office.
 None of the patients indicated that the tests should not be performed in the dental office.
 Few patients expressed any significant concern or anxiety about the test either before or after it was completed.
 Twenty-six percent (24/91) of the patients were found to have a cardiac arrhythmia; however, most of these were nonserious arrhythmias (18/24) and would not have had an impact on planned dental procedures.
 Six patients were identified with arrhythmias that required medical referral before dental treatment was started.

1814,"Development of intrapancreatic transplantable model of pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma in Syrian golden hamsters.
 Intrapancreatic and subcutaneous (SC) inoculation of cultured pancreatic cancer cells, derived from an induced primary pancreatic cancer in a Syrian hamster, resulted in tumor take in all recipient hamsters.
 The intrapancreatic allografts grew rapidly, were invasive, and metastasized into the lymph nodes and liver in 2 of 9 cases.
 In comparison, SC tumors grew relatively slower and formed a large encapsulated mass without invasion and metastases.
 Histologically, tumors of both sites showed fairly well-differentiated adenocarcinomas of ductal/ductular type resembling the induced primary cancer.
 Similar to the primary induced pancreatic cancers, tumor cells of both allografts expressed blood-group-related antigens, including A, B, H, Le(b), Le(y), Le(x), and tumor-associated antigen TAG-72.
 The tumor cells did not express Le(a), CA 19-9, 17-1A, or DU-PAN-2.
 The expression of these antigens was retained in the metastases and presented the same patterns of reactivity as the allografts.
 Thus intrapancreatic transplantation provides a rapid model for production of pancreatic cancer with morphologic similarities to human pancreatic cancer.

 The prospective study included 122 sciatica patients who had not undergone operation (NOPs) and 220 sciatica patients who had undergone operation (OPs); all had been examined by rhizography.
 The follow-up study was done on 110 (90%) of the NOPs and 212 (96%) of the OPs.
 The NOPs were divided into two groups: 30 patients with pathologic rhizography (PR) and 80 patients with negative rhizography (NR).
 Pain-, ADL-, and occupation-handicap indices showed that after the 1 year follow-up the OP group had the best result and the NR group the lowest result.
 The PR group had nearly as good a result as the OP group.
 Thus, sciatica patients are candidates for conservative therapy, even though they have pathologic findings in rhizography, if the symptoms are mild.
 To improve therapeutic outcome, more accurate diagnostic tools are needed to develop specific therapy especially for those sciatica patients with negative rhizography.

 In the initial series of 198 patients treated at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, a review of presenting chest radiographs available on 192 of these patients showed 49 patients with mediastinal masses greater than one third the greatest posteroanterior chest diameter.
 Five patients had stage IIB disease, and 44 had stage III or IV disease.
 Thirty-five (71%) patients achieved a complete remission with MOPP chemotherapy.
 Fourteen (40%) of the complete responders relapsed, but four of these achieved durable remissions in response to subsequent therapy.
 Thirty (61%) patients have died (14 induction failures, nine relapsed patients, seven complete responders in remission).
 Thus, with a median follow-up of 20 years (range, 15 to 23), the overall survival for the group is 39%, and the disease-free survival for the complete responders is 60%.
 A subset of 10 patients received mantle radiation therapy after maximal response to MOPP.
 One of these patients failed to achieve complete remission, but among the nine complete responders only one has relapsed.
 In contrast, 13 of 26 (50%) patients achieving a complete response to MOPP alone have relapsed (P2 = .0536).
 Although MOPP alone was not prospectively compared with MOPP plus radiation therapy in the treatment of advanced-stage massive mediastinal Hodgkin's disease in this series, the retrospective analysis shows a nearly significant difference in disease-free survival favoring combined modality treatment.
 The difference in tumor mortality between MOPP-treated (44%) and combined modality-treated patients (80%) was also nearly significant (P2 = .055).
 However, overall survival differences between patients treated with MOPP alone and those treated with combined modality therapy were not significantly different (P2 = 0.23) because of the mortality related to late complications of combined modality treatment.

 The timing effect of sestamibi administration with respect to the onset of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion was studied in swine.
 In different groups of animals sestamibi was administered prior to coronary artery occlusion, during occlusion, or 1/2 hour following reperfusion.
 Sestamibi administered prior to coronary occlusion resulted in an insignificant decrease in 99mTc activity in the ischemic zone.
 However, infarct zone activity was reduced to 62 +/- 14% of the nonischemic zone.
 In contrast, administration during coronary occlusion resulted in similar significant reductions of both ischemic and infarct zone activity.
 Administration of sestamibi during reperfusion resulted in normal ischemic zone activity and markedly reduced activity in the infarct zone.
 Significantly reduced activity in the infarct zone was found to be independent of the timing of sestamibi administration with respect to the onset of myocardial ischemia and/or reperfusion.
 Thus, cell viability appears required for uptake and retention of isotope activity.

 Tumor spheroids of HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma and A375 melanoma were established to investigate the uptake and clearance kinetics of TNT-1, a monoclonal antibody that targets necrotic cells of tumors.
 Our data reveal that there was rapid uptake of TNT-1 and its F(ab')2 fragment in both spheroid models, whereas an antibody of irrelevant specificity, Lym-1, and its F(ab')2 fragment bound poorly to the spheroids.
 Unlike previously reported monoclonal antibodies to tumor cell-surface antigens, TNT-1 showed 1) a linear uptake that increased over time without saturation in tumor spheroids and 2) an unexpected uptake by a subpopulation of cells in the viable outer rim of the spheroids.
 These preclinical studies provide important information concerning the therapeutic potential of TNT monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and micrometastases.

 The survival of patients with pregnancy-associated (PA) breast cancer is difficult to predict for two reasons: The combination is very rare, and the natural history of breast cancer that is not associated with pregnancy is intricate and varies among individuals.
 Valid data collection and analysis is problematic given that studies gather patients over many years.
 The charts of 56 women with Stages I, II, and III breast cancer, who were pregnant or within 1 year postpartum at the time of breast cancer diagnosis between 1960 and 1980, were analyzed.
 Patients with PA breast cancer were compared to nonpregnant women of comparable ages, who were treated at the same hospital, by the same physicians, and during the same period.
 Four patients were lost before 5-year follow-up, and one patient before 10-year follow-up.
 These five patients had distant metastases at the time they were lost to follow-up, and are considered to have died within that time.
 Across stages, patients with PA breast cancer have survival not significantly different from those patients with non-pregnancy-associated (non-PA) breast cancer.

 There is now a joint UICC-AJC classification for cervical lymph nodes based mainly on the size of the nodes.
 There is a recognized error in palpation, not only for detecting the presence of tumour but also its size.
 This study used an animal tumour model system to compare the ability of 6 independent observers of varying experience to detect and stage superficially transplanted growths.
 A preclinical medical student was as good as a Consultant ENT Surgeon in predicting the presence of tumour but the ability to stage tumours accurately was related to experience.
 Whilst the most experienced observers accurately estimated the size of tumours less than 2 cm, they were less accurate for larger (greater than 2 cm) tumours which were constantly understaged.
 This phenomenon may have important clinical implications particularly related to current nodal staging criteria.

 Previous studies suggest that chronic oral administration of retinol and other retinoids causes elevation of plasma triglyceride concentrations.
 The effects of chronic oral administration of beta-carotene, a carotenoid partially metabolized to retinol, on plasma lipid concentrations have not been well studied; therefore, we studied 61 subjects over 12 mo while they were enrolled in a skin-cancer-prevention study in which patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 30) or 50 mg beta-carotene/d orally (n = 31).
 At study entry and 1 y later, fasting blood samples were obtained for measurement of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, retinol, and beta-carotene.
 Retinol concentrations changed minimally in both groups; beta-carotene concentration increased an average of 12.1 +/- 47 nmol/L in the placebo group and 4279 +/- 657 nmol/L in the active-treatment group.
 Both groups experienced similar small increases in triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations and small decreases in HDL cholesterol.

 This article presents prediction equations for several cardiovascular disease endpoints, which are based on measurements of several known risk factors.
 Subjects (n = 5573) were original and offspring subjects in the Framingham Heart Study, aged 30 to 74 years, and initially free of cardiovascular disease.
 Equations to predict risk for the following were developed: myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD), death from CHD, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and death from cardiovascular disease.
 The equations demonstrated the potential importance of controlling multiple risk factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy) as opposed to focusing on one single risk factor.
 The parametric model used was seen to have several advantages over existing standard regression models.
 Unlike logistic regression, it can provide predictions for different lengths of time, and probabilities can be expressed in a more straightforward way than the Cox proportional hazards model.

 These results were compared with those obtained by an automated peroxidase-antiperoxidase method with DNAse pretreatment of fixed embedded sections (Method 2), with ER immunostain on frozen sections (Method 3), and with biochemical results (dextran-coated charcoal cytosolic [DCC] assay).
 Compared with the DCC assay, Methods 1, 2, and 3 gave sensitivities of 54%, 25%, and 89%, respectively.
 The sensitivity for Method 1 was increased to 74% in those cases with DCC results showing greater than 50 fmol/mg protein.
 These findings indicate that ER immunohistochemical studies on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (as assayed by Method 1) provide useful clinical information when the results are positive.
 A negative result, especially if surrounding normal elements are not positive, may indicate no receptors, receptor levels less than 50 fmol/mg protein, or improper tissue preservation.
 In the absence of fresh tissue for ER assay by DCC assay or of frozen sections for immunostaining, and with an understanding of its limitations, this method may be useful.

1828,"Concept of maximal flow ratio for immediate evaluation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty result by videodensitometry.
 BACKGROUND.
 In the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), immediate information about the result of the intervention is important, whereas morphological parameters are often less reliable than in diagnostic coronary arteriography.
 Recently, a new videodensitometric method was introduced and validated in animal experiments, which allows accurate comparison of maximal myocardial perfusion between situations with different degrees of stenosis.
 This method uses mean transit time (Tmn) of the contrast agent at maximal hyperemia as a parameter for maximal flow and is strictly in accordance with indicated dilation theory.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 In 40 patients with angina pectoris, single-vessel disease, and a positive exercise test at the time of acceptance for PTCA, this approach was applied for evaluation of the improvement of maximal flow achieved by the PTCA.
 Maximal vasodilation was induced immediately before and 15 minutes after PTCA by intracoronary administration of papaverine, and digital angiographic studies were performed.
 By special breath-holding instruction, almost motionless, triggered image acquisition was possible during 15-20 heartbeats.
 Excellent subtraction images could be obtained, and reliable determination of Tmn at maximal hyperemia was possible in 33 patients both before and after PTCA.
 The ratio between maximal flow after and before PTCA, called maximal flow ratio (MFR), was represented by the ratio between Tmn before and after the intervention and compared with the results of exercise testing 24-48 hours before and 7-10 days after the procedure.
 After correction for pressure changes, MFR was 2.2 +/- 1.5 for the 33 dilated vessels and 1.0 +/- 0.2 for 25 normal vessels serving as a control.
 In 94% of all patients, an MFR value of more than 1.6 or less than 1.6 discriminated between presence or absence of reversal of exercise test result from positive to negative.
 If on-line judgment of success was based upon angiographic parameters or measurement of trans-stenotic pressure gradient, the relation with noninvasive functional improvement was present only in 66% and 74% of all patients, respectively.
 A definite range of what can be called normal Tmn at maximal hyperemia could be distinguished, and post-PTCA values for successfully dilated arteries returned completely to this normal range.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Accurate comparison of maximal myocardial perfusion before and after PTCA is possible in man, improvement of maximal flow is highly related to functional improvement as indicated by exercise test results, and, therefore, this method provides a straightforward way for on-line evaluation of the result of the intervention.

1829,"Edge detection versus densitometry for assessing coronary stenting quantitatively.
 The optimal method used to analyze quantitatively the immediate angiographic results of coronary stenting in the coronary arteries has not been studied.
 Accordingly, minimal luminal cross-sectional area was determined by 2 methods, edge detection and densitometry, in 19 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and then coronary stent implantation for symptomatic coronary stenoses.
 The correlation coefficient, 0.73 before angioplasty, decreased to 0.59 after coronary angioplasty and then increased to 0.83 after stent implantation.
 The mean differences between edge detection and densitometric determinations of minimal luminal cross-sectional area were 0.31 +/- 0.51 mm2 before PTCA, -0.38 +/- 1.22 mm2 after angioplasty and 0.35 +/- 0.79 mm2 after coronary stenting.
 It is concluded that, although the correlation and variability in the measurement of minimal luminal cross-sectional area between edge detection and densitometry deteriorate after PTCA, they are improved after stenting, probably because of smoothing of the vessel contours by the stent and remodeling of the stented segment into a more circular configuration.
 Therefore, in the stented coronary artery, edge detection and densitometry are equally acceptable methods of analysis.

 Platelet-derived growth factor receptors are composed of two subunits (alpha and beta) that associate with one another to form three functionally active dimeric receptor species.
 The two subunits are encoded by separate loci in humans and other species.
 In this study, we used conventional interspecific backcross mapping and an analysis of a deletional mutation to establish close linkage between the alpha-subunit gene (Pdgfra) and the dominant spotting (W) locus on mouse chromosome 5.
 Further, by analyzing the restriction fragment length polymorphisms in interspecific F1 hybrids, we were able to demonstrate that the closely associated patch (Ph) locus carries a deletion in Pdgfra.
 This observation was confirmed by both DNA and RNA analysis of 10.5-day fetuses produced from crosses between Ph heterozygotes.
 Out of 16 fetuses analyzed, Pdgfra genomic sequences were absent and no mRNA for the receptor was detected in 6 fetuses that were developmentally abnormal (the presumptive Ph homozygotes).
 We also determined that the deletion associated with the Ph mutation does not extend into the coding sequences of the adjacent Kit gene, by analysis of the genomic DNA from both the interspecific F1 hybrids and the presumptive Ph homozygotes.
 The absence of Pdgfra genomic sequences and the lack of detectable message associated with the Ph mutation should make this mutant a valuable asset for understanding the role of the receptor alpha subunit during mammalian development.

 All were seropositive for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).
 DNA extracted from tumor biopsies/peripheral blood lymphocytes of nine patients was shown by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to contain HTLV-I proviral DNA.
 Blot hybridization of DNA extracted from seven patients with an HTLV-I cDNA probe revealed a monoclonal pattern of proviral integration consistent with a diagnosis of ATL.
 Eight of the 10 patients were women.
 Six patients were from Haiti, three from Jamaica, and one from the Bahamas.
 All patients had very aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 Two patients presented with sinus and retro-orbital involvement; another had gastric lymphoma that perforated.
 Nine patients developed hypercalcemia.
 Eight patients died within 1 year of diagnosis.

1834,"Why surgeons prefer not to care for trauma patients.
 A survey of the Washington State Chapter of the American College of Surgeons was undertaken to document the opinions of surgeons on trauma care issues.
 Thirty-nine percent of the total sample of surgeons who responded would prefer not to treat any trauma patients.
 These surgeons were more likely to be older, to practice in an urban setting, to feel that trauma call has a negative impact on elective practice, and to believe more strongly that reimbursement from trauma patients is not equal to that of nontrauma patients.
 They also agreed more strongly with the statements that these patients require a greater time commitment and pose an increased medicolegal risk.
 The most significant influence on preference not to treat trauma patients was exerted by the perception of a negative impact on practice, older age, and perception of increased medicolegal risk.
 Reimbursement issues and location of practice were less influential factors.
 This information can be used to target concerns and barriers to active, willing participation in a trauma care system and to tailor strategies to deal with them effectively.

 Forty-two patients with primary invasive vulvar carcinoma were treated with radical vulvectomy and deep femoral lymphadenectomy with preservation of the fascia lata and cribriform fascia.
 The rationale for using this technique was based on anatomic knowledge of the topographic distribution of groin lymph nodes, which was confirmed by the study of 50 cadavers.
 The preliminary data show that the number of superficial and deep femoral lymph nodes removed from the 42 patients (mean number of nodes, 20; range, 8-32) was similar to the number reported in anatomy books.
 In addition, the five-year actuarial survival rate, 70%, was comparable to that in the literature.

 The present work was designed to compare in vitro cell growth kinetics with in vivo growth under conditions as similar as possible using labeling with [3H]thymidine.
 To this purpose, FRTL-5 cells were cultured as monolayers and as three-dimensional spheroids embedded in collagen gels and transplanted simultaneously into nude mice treated with perchlorate and a low iodine diet.
 The growth of the transplants was compared to that of the thyroids in host mice.
 In the intact thyroid, the fraction of [3H]thymidine-labeled follicular cells (FLC; 24-h labeling) increased sluggishly to a maximum of 10% after 3 weeks of goitrogen exposure, with a subsequent autoregulatory decrease to 3% at 7 weeks.
 A 4-fold higher FLC was found in six adenomas, indicating focal failure of growth-restraining mechanisms.
 In nonconfluent monolayer cultures the FLC was as high as 90%, even within large individual clusters where cells are in tight mutual contact.
 Solid, highly cellular grafts growing from transplanted monodispersed cells showed an average FLC of 20%, which is 5 times higher than the FLC in the identically stimulated mouse thyroid.
 In collagen-embedded cells, forming three-dimensional spheroids, the mean FLC decreased from 70% at 1 week in vitro (40% in vivo) to 20% at 3 weeks both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting effective auto-regulation of excessive growth in both conditions.
 However, these FLC were again much higher than the 3% FLC in simultaneously assessed host thyroids.
 The difference remained throughout the 45-day period studied.
 We conclude that FRTL-5 cells growing as monolayers and as three-dimensional spheroids in vitro or after xenotransplantation in vivo invariably show much higher proliferation rates under comparable environmental conditions than the normal follicular epithelium in the thyroids of host mice.
 The one exception is the confluent monolayer with near-zero growth, while densely packed three-dimensional transplants still grow intensively.
 Although growth-retarding cell to cell interactions are also clearly operative in growing FRTL-5 cells, they are less effective than those dampening the replication rate of the thyrocytes within the monolayer hull of normal follicles.
 A local failure of these mechanisms, allowing growth rates comparable to those of grafted FRTL-5 cells results in adenoma formation in normal thyroids.
 These observations call for caution in the transfer of in vitro growth studies with FRTL-5 cells to in vivo conditions prevailing in the normal thyroid.

 BACKGROUND.
 As part of an interdisciplinary study of medical injury and malpractice litigation, we estimated the incidence of adverse events, defined as injuries caused by medical management, and of the subgroup of such injuries that resulted from negligent or substandard care.
 METHODS.
 We reviewed 30,121 randomly selected records from 51 randomly selected acute care, nonpsychiatric hospitals in New York State in 1984.
 We then developed population estimates of injuries and computed rates according to the age and sex of the patients as well as the specialties of the physicians.
 RESULTS.
 Adverse events occurred in 3.7 percent of the hospitalizations (95 percent confidence interval, 3.2 to 4.2), and 27.6 percent of the adverse events were due to negligence (95 percent confidence interval, 22.5 to 32.6).
 Although 70.5 percent of the adverse events gave rise to disability lasting less than six months, 2.6 percent caused permanently disabling injuries and 13.6 percent led to death.
 The percentage of adverse events attributable to negligence increased in the categories of more severe injuries (Wald test chi 2 = 21.04, P less than 0.0001).
 Using weighted totals, we estimated that among the 2,671,863 patients discharged from New York hospitals in 1984 there were 98,609 adverse events and 27,179 adverse events involving negligence.
 Rates of adverse events rose with age (P less than 0.0001).
 The percentage of adverse events due to negligence was markedly higher among the elderly (P less than 0.01).
 There were significant differences in rates of adverse events among categories of clinical specialties (P less than 0.0001), but no differences in the percentage due to negligence.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 There is a substantial amount of injury to patients from medical management, and many injuries are the result of substandard care.

1839,"Elevated serum aluminum levels in severely burned patients who are receiving large quantities of albumin.
 Aluminum contaminates various fluids that are used in intravenous therapy, and it is associated with bone disease and encephalopathy.
 Albumin is highly contaminated with aluminum, which is eliminated primarily by renal excretion.
 Patients with burns receive large quantities of albumin and have impaired renal function, which puts them at hypothetical risk for aluminum loading.
 To assess the risk of aluminum loading we analyzed sera from 12 patients with burns for aluminum concentrations.
 Serum aluminum concentration was elevated in 8 of the 12 patients, and levels were at or near toxicity in 3 of the 8.
 Serum aluminum and serum creatinine levels directly correlated, r = 0.71 and p less than 0.005.
 No relation was found between serum aluminum and amount of albumin received.
 However, patients with the highest serum aluminum levels were the most severely burned and none survived.
 Thus patients with burns who are receiving albumin are at risk for aluminum loading.
 Impaired renal function contributes to aluminum retention.

 Flow cytometric studies of cellular DNA and RNA content using the acridine-orange technique were conducted in 81 patients with multiple myeloma (MM).
 All patients were treated with the M-2 protocol and clinical response was evaluated according to the criteria of the Chronic Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force.
 Aneuploid DNA stemlines were found in 38.2% of untreated patients with a median DNA index (DNA-I) of 1.15 in marrow aspirates and 1.22 in biopsy specimens.
 The median percentage of cells with abnormal DNA content was 31.5 (aspirates) and 35 (biopsy specimens) and a positive correlation with the percentage of bone marrow plasma cells was observed.
 Significantly higher proliferation (S-phase) was found in marrow biopsy specimens as compared with marrow aspirates.
 Significantly higher RNA content (RNA index [RNA-I]) was observed in aneuploid versus diploid patients in biopsy material.
 There was no difference in response to the Memorial Hospital M-2 protocol between diploid and aneuploid patients.
 In patients with DNA-I greater than 1.15 remission duration was shorter as compared with DNA-I less than or equal to 1.15.
 Furthermore, no difference in cellular RNA content was noted between responders and nonresponders.
 This study demonstrates no correlation between cellular RNA content and response, as previously described for patients treated with vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone (VAD), but DNA aneuploidy appears to be an adverse prognostic factor in MM patients treated with the M-2 protocol.
 It also demonstrates that prognostic models for MM are not universal but depend on the chemotherapeutic regimen used.

 As of the end of September 1989, 52 EXS Dacron grafts had been implanted for femoropopliteal bypass operations.
 The distal ends of 27 grafts were anastomosed to above-knee popliteal arteries and those of 25 grafts to below-knee popliteal arteries.
 The cumulative patency rate of above-knee grafts was 71.3% at 54 months, and that of below-knee grafts was 78.8% at 48 months (n.s.).
 Kinking and stenosis of the arteriosclerotic proximal and/or mid popliteal artery when the knee was bent were angiographically remarkable.
 These changes may explain why some femoropopliteal grafts occlude with time and why the late results of above-knee grafts are not much better than those of below-knee grafts.

 The relationship between short-term memory impairment and sentence comprehension is explored in a right-handed patient with a focal temporoparietal lesion of the right hemisphere.
 The general clinical profile, as well as characteristics of the patient's immediate memory for word lists, suggests the occurrence of a 'mirror image' crossed aphasia.
 Detailed analysis of the patient's ability to repeat and to comprehend sentences, however, indicates some important differences between this case and previously reported patients with short-term memory impairment.
 It is suggested that these differences, which may be related to an unusual pattern of neuroanatomical organization of cognitive functions, involve symptom dissociations with implications for models of normal language/memory interactions.

 The abdominal wall is the source of significant problems for patients undergoing multiple abdominal operations.
 The orientation of sequential incisions must be carefully considered to avoid compromise of the abdominal wall blood supply, which may result in either acute (dehiscence) or delayed (ventral hernia) complications.
 Infections are the most serious problems of the multiply operated on abdominal wall.
 These complications may range from simple wound infection to necrotizing fasciitis.
 Management may require only simple drainage of the infection or may entail extensive debridement for the necrotizing processes.
 Regardless of the cause, the multiply operated on abdominal wall may require reconstruction because of lost fascia.

1846,"Basic mechanisms in vascular headache.
 To better understand and treat painful conditions, one needs to identify the cause, discover the source, and develop knowledge of peripheral and central pain transmission; headaches are no exception.
 The development of appropriate animal models is important.
 Accordingly, we have reviewed the anatomy, neurochemistry, electrophysiology, and pharmacology of the trigeminovascular system in experimental animals and emphasized whenever possible the relevance of this final common pathway to migraine, cluster, and other headache syndromes in humans.
 For example, based on recent anatomic dissections, the pericarotid cavernous sinus plexus was suggested as an important focus to investigate cluster headache pathophysiology.
 This plexus is an anatomic point of convergence for the nerves giving rise to the signs of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and sensory symptoms that develop in cluster patients.
 As in other nociceptive systems, trigeminovascular axons assume at least two important roles.
 One concerns the transmission of nociceptive information.
 Electrophysiologic evidence supports the trigeminal nucleus caudalis as an important site for the convergence of visceral (vessel) and somatic (forehead) inputs to mediate the referral of vascular pain to superficial tissues.
 A second important role concerns the initiation of local increases in blood flow and enhanced protein permeability (sterile inflammation) via the axonal release of vasoactive neuropeptides.
 Plasma extravasation develops within the dura mater following trigeminal stimulation.
 Extravasation can be blocked by the administration of ergot alkaloids or sumatriptan, a new serotonin-like agonist, and a prejunctional (neuronal) mechanism of action for these drugs (such as blockade of release) was suggested based on experimental evidence.
 Whether vasoconstriction also relates to the therapeutic efficacy remains to be determined.
 As in other organ systems, real or threatened tissue injury provides an important stimulus for depolarizing sensory fibers.
 The stimulus may come from external conditions such as reduced blood flow or hypoglycemia.
 The brain may also possess intrinsic neuronal mechanisms by which nociceptors may be synthesized (e.g., glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, seizures).
 Molecules of relevance include bradykinin, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and potassium.
 Experimental evidence was presented demonstrating that the trigeminal nerve mediates hyperemia within cortical gray matter by axon-reflex like mechanisms.
 An important role for this nerve was established during the hyperemic period of recirculation after ischemia or during severe hypertension above the limits of autoregulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

 Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was used to treat 340 aortoiliac lesions in 200 patients who were followed for as long as 90 months (mean, 28.7 months; median, 23 months).
 The initial success rate was 94.7% for lesions and 93.0% for patients.
 The indications for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty included claudication in 117 patients (58.5%), rest pain or ischemic night pain in 47 (23.5%), limb salvage in 33 (16.5%), and aiding in wound healing in three (1.5%).
 In the series, 70% of the patients had two or more cardiovascular risk factors.
 Angioplasty was initially unsuccessful in 14 patients, and 10 patients were lost to follow-up.
 Follow-up was obtained in 176 patients.
 The long-term results were analyzed using the life table method to determine cumulative patency.
 Fourteen patients were considered failures because of recurrent disease or symptoms.
 The projected 7.5-year cumulative patency rate was 85%.
 When the response to redilatation was considered, the projected 7.5-year cumulative patency rate was 92%.

 A total of 340 patients treated in the Intensive Care Unit of the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology at Helsinki University Central Hospital were analyzed in this study.
 They had in all 1,071 fractures and luxations of the pelvis and extremities, of which the trauma surgeons and radiologists on duty initially missed 45 injuries, i.e., 4.2%.
 Taking into account the eventual late symptoms, the most severe delayed diagnoses were of injuries located around the hip and knee joints.
 The patients with delayed diagnoses were, on the average, the most severely ill: their needs for primary blood transfusions and assisted respiration resembled the needs of patients who later died of their trauma or its complications.
 The most common causes of the delay in diagnosis were: radiographs not done in 60% of patients, and no notation of visible injury in radiographs in 31%.
 Inferior quality of radiographs, unnoticed radiologists' reports, a fracture visible at the outermost corner of a radiograph, a fracture hidden by other fractures, or excessive obesity of the patient may also contribute to a delay.
 The study presents measures for improving diagnostic strategies, but it would appear that delayed diagnoses cannot be totally eradicated.

 A porcine rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap model was designed and validated in nine pigs.
 This TRAM flap was based on the deep inferior epigastric (DIE) vessels with an 8 x 18 cm transverse skin paddle at the superior end of the rectus abdominis muscle.
 The model was subsequently used to test our hypothesis of surgical augmentation of flap viability by vascular territory expansion.
 Specifically, we observed that ligation of the superior epigastric (SE) vessels at 4, 7, 14, and 28 days (N = 6 to 8) prior to raising the TRAM flaps significantly increased (p less than 0.05) the length and area of the viable skin in the transverse skin paddles of the treatment flaps compared with the contralateral shammanipulated control flaps.
 This significant increase in skin viability was seen to be accompanied by a significant increase (p less than 0.05) in skin and muscle capillary blood flow in the treatment TRAM flaps compared with the controls (N = 9).
 The mechanism of vascular territory expansion is unclear.
 We postulate that hypoxia resulting from the ligation of the superior epigastric vessels prior to the flap surgery may play a role in the triggering of the deep inferior epigastric artery to take over some of the territory previously perfused by the superior epigastric artery.
 This would then increase the skin and muscle capillary blood flow in the transverse paddle when the TRAM flap was raised on the deep inferior epigastric vascular pedicle.

 OBJECTIVE: This study was constructed to detail the demographic and phenomenological features of chronic hair pullers as well as to assess psychiatric comorbidity in a sizable study group.
 METHOD: Subjects were drawn from an outpatient population of chronic hair pullers who had been referred to a trichotillomania clinic or had responded to a newspaper advertisement announcing a treatment study of adults who pull out their hair.
 Sixty adult chronic hair pullers completed a semistructured interview that focused on their hair-pulling behavior and demographic characteristics and that incorporated screening questions for DSM-III-R axis I disorders.
 The data were tabulated to derive a comprehensive picture of this group.
 RESULTS: The typical subject was a 34-year-old woman who had pulled hair from two or more sites for 21 years.
 All subjects described either tension before or relief/gratification after pulling hair from the primary site, but 17% (N = 10) failed to describe both of these characteristics and thus failed to fulfill the DMS-III-R criteria for trichotillomania.
 Forty-nine subjects (82%) qualified for past or current axis I diagnoses other than trichotillomania.
 Several characteristics of the study group suggested phenomenological differences between obsessive-compulsive disorder and trichotillomania.
 CONCLUSIONS: Adult trichotillomania is a chronic disorder, frequently involving multiple hair sites, and is associated with high rates of psychiatric comorbidity.
 Its relation to obsessive-compulsive disorder requires further clarification.
 The tension-reduction requirement in DSM-III-R for the diagnosis of trichotillomania may be overly restrictive.

 Development of regional medical care systems to treat patients who sustain major accidental injuries (trauma victims) has been based on autopsy studies which demonstrate that hospitals that meet certain accepted criteria of readiness (trauma centers) can prevent needless deaths of trauma victims.
 However, since only autopsy data have been available from non-trauma centers, it has not previously been possible to compare morbidity data between trauma centers and non-trauma hospitals.
 This study examines discharge abstract data and a new patient classification system called patient management categories (PMC) which are generated from this abstract data to evaluate length of stay (LOS), complications, and death to compare morbidity and mortality data from trauma centers and non-trauma centers.
 Discharge abstracts for 1,332 patients with the PMC of femoral shaft fracture with operation were obtained from all hospitals in Western Pennsylvania and Maryland for 1 year.
 Data from trauma centers were identified and compared to non-trauma centers using the following criteria: time to OR (less than or equal to 2 days vs.
 greater than 2 days), age (0-12, 13-55, greater than 55 years), associated injuries, and development of complications and death.
 Patients treated in trauma centers had significantly fewer complications (21% vs.

 Protein digestion and metabolism have been studied in laboratory rats and miniature pigs to investigate the mechanisms of action of lactulose and lactitol when used in the treatment of patients with portosystemic encephalopathy.
 Lactulose (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-beta-D-fructofuranose) and lactitol (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-D-glucitol) increased the excretion of nitrogenous material in the faeces and decreased nitrogen excretion in the urine in a similar degree to that reported for human patients.
 In studies with germ free rats given lactulose no such effect was observed, suggesting that, for lactulose at least, these effects are mediated by the gut flora.
 Measurement of the alpha-, epsilon-diaminopimelic acid content of the faeces confirmed that the enhancement of faecal nitrogen was due to an increased contribution from bacteria.
 The similarity in the results for lactulose and lactitol suggests that, from the perspective of protein metabolism, lactitol acts in a similar way to lactulose in the treatment of portosystemic encephalopathy.

 Although the foregoing review of embryologic development and congenital anomalies of the spine in infants and children is necessarily brief, the most commonly encountered abnormalities have been reviewed, and when possible, an attempt has been made to cite the stage of embryologic development at which the various abnormalities originate.
 As noted, congenital abnormalities of the spine are relatively uncommon but may be of profound clinical significance.
 During the past decade, the most significant developments in the diagnosis and treatment of these abnormalities have been ultrasonography, CT scanning, and MR imaging.
 In the neonate, the spinal cord and neural outflow can be evaluated by ultrasonography until the osseous elements begin to fuse.
 Thereafter, MR imaging is the procedure of choice because it permits evaluation of the spine and spinal cord in all planes of imaging and provides detailed evaluation of the effect of osseous abnormalities on neural structures.

 Women with regional or distant invasive disease were least likely to have had Pap tests, and, within this group, those aged between 35 and 64 years were also least likely to have seen a physician.

 A total of 211 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (168 with tumors refractory to prior chemotherapy and 43 with no prior chemotherapy) from 33 different Southwest Oncology Group institutions had their tumors sampled and specimens shipped to two central laboratories for drug-sensitivity testing in a human tumor cloning assay.
 The 168 patients with a prior history of chemotherapy failure (median of four prior chemotherapeutic agents) were treated with the most effective agent(s) found in the cloning assay (23 patients), and those patients whose tumors did not form colonies in vitro or did not manifest any sensitivity to agent(s) were treated with a clinician's choice of agent(s) (101 patients).
 The remaining 44 of the 168 patients were not treated with chemotherapy because of deteriorating performance status or early death.
 The complete and partial response rate in patients treated according to assay results was 28% versus 11% for the patients treated according to clinician's choice (P = 0.03).
 There was no statistically significant difference in survival between the two options (6.25 versus 7 months, respectively).
 The 43 patients with no history of prior chemotherapy were all treated with standard combination chemotherapy, and their clinical response was compared with their in vitro sensitivity to the same agents.
 Overall there was a 100% true-positive rate and 100% true-negative rate for the seven evaluable patients.
 From these data the authors conclude that use of the human tumor cloning assay may increase the response rate but not the survival for selected patients with advanced chemotherapy-refractory ovarian cancer.
 The study is weakened, however, by the many steps of patient selection necessitated by inadequate tumor colony formation in vitro and the inability to treat all patients (because of early death or a rapid decline in performance status).
 The assay does appear to be worthy of additional study for predicting response to combination chemotherapy in patients without a prior history of chemotherapy.
 Finally the use of central chemosensitivity testing laboratories is feasible for testing in vitro predictive assays in a cooperative group setting.

1860,"Value of peak exercise oxygen consumption for optimal timing of cardiac transplantation in ambulatory patients with heart failure.
 BACKGROUND.
 Optimal timing of cardiac transplantation in ambulatory patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction is often difficult.
 To determine whether measurement of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) during maximal exercise testing can be used to identify patients in whom transplantation can be safely deferred, we prospectively performed exercise testing on all ambulatory patients referred for transplant between October 1986 and December 1989.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Patients were assigned into one of three groups on the basis of exercise data: Group 1 (n = 35) comprised patients accepted for transplant (VO2 less than or equal to 14 ml/kg/min); group 2 (n = 52) comprised patients considered too well for transplant (VO2 greater than 14 ml/kg/min); and group 3 (n = 27) comprised patients with low VO2 rejected for transplant due to noncardiac problems.
 All three groups were comparable in New York Heart Association functional class, ejection fraction, and cardiac index (p = NS).
 Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was significantly lower in group 2 than in either group 1 or 3 (p less than 0.05), although there was wide overlap.
 Patients with preserved exercise capacity (group 2) had cumulative 1- and 2-year survival rates of 94% and 84%, which are equal to survival levels after transplantation.
 In contrast, patients rejected for transplant (group 3) had survival rates of only 47% at 1 year and 32% at 2 years, whereas patients awaiting transplantation (group 1) had a survival rate of 70% at 1 year (both p less than 0.005 versus patients with VO2 greater than 14 ml/kg/min).
 All deaths in group 2 were sudden.
 By univariate and multivariate analyses, peak VO2 was the best predictor of survival, with only pulmonary capillary wedge pressure providing additional prognostic information.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 These data suggest that cardiac transplantation can be safely deferred in ambulatory patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and peak exercise VO2 of more than 14 ml/min/kg.

 The effects of a calcium-entry blocker, nicardipine, on intrarenal hemodynamics were studied in essential hypertension.
 A 4-week study was performed in eight patients with essential hypertension who were given a regular sodium diet in the first and third weeks, and a sodium-restricted diet in the second and fourth weeks.
 Nicardipine, 60 mg/d, was administered in the third and fourth weeks.
 The urinary sodium excretion rate (UNaV) was plotted on the y-axis against the mean arterial pressure (MAP) on the x-axis before and after the administration of nicardipine.
 Assuming the difference between MAP and the x-intercept of this renal function curve represents the effective filtration pressure across the glomerular capillaries, the intrarenal hemodynamics such as afferent arteriolar resistance (RA) and efferent arteriolar resistances (RE), glomerular pressure (PG), and gross filtration coefficient (KFG) were calculated.
 Although the MAP on regular salt diet was lowered from 125 +/- 3 to 109 +/- 2 mm Hg by nicardipine, neither the renal blood flow rate (RBF) (670 +/- 40 mL/min) nor the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (79 +/- 2 mL/min) was altered.
 The RA was estimated to be reduced from 9,300 +/- 900 to 7,400 +/- 700 dyne.s.cm-5 (P less than 0.01), while no changes were noted in RE (4,900 +/- 400 dyne.s.cm-5), PG (50 +/- 1 mm Hg), or KFG (0.180 +/- 0.041 [mL/s]/mm Hg).
 Essential hypertension has been characterized by a prominent increase in RA, resulting in maintenance of normal PG.

 Self-reported and observed symptoms of tobacco withdrawal were collected before cessation and at follow-ups of 1 to 2 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months.
 Self-reported and/or observed anger, anxiety, craving, difficulty concentrating, hunger, impatience, and restlessness were the most prominent symptoms of tobacco withdrawal.
 These symptoms had returned to precessation levels by 1 month except increased weight, hunger, and craving continued for 6 months in many smokers.
 Nicotine gum decreased most symptoms, including craving and hunger but not weight.
 Abstinent smokers with more intense withdrawal were not more likely to relapse.
 Abstinent smokers who gained more weight were less likely to relapse.

1866,"Separation and characterization of saponins with adjuvant activity from Quillaja saponaria Molina cortex.
 Saponins were purified from Quillaja saponaria Molina bark by silica and reverse phase chromatography.
 The resulting purified saponins were tested for adjuvant activity in mice.
 Several distinct saponins, designated QS-7, QS-17, QS-18, and QS-21, were demonstrated to boost antibody levels by 100-fold or more when used in mouse immunizations with the Ag BSA and beef liver cytochrome b5.
 These purified saponins increased titers in all major IgG subclasses.
 To determine optimal dose in mice for adjuvant response, QS-7 and QS-21 were tested in a dose-response study in intradermal immunization with BSA in mice; for both of these purified saponins, adjuvant response (determined by stimulation of ELISA titers to BSA) neared maximum at doses of 5 micrograms and was shown to plateau up to the highest dose tested, 80 micrograms.
 These purified saponins vary considerably in their toxicity, as assessed by lethality in mice; the main component, QS-18, being the most toxic.
 Saponins QS-7 and QS-21 showed no or very low toxicity in mice, respectively.
 None of these saponins stimulated production of reaginic antibodies.
 The monosaccharide composition of these saponins showed similar but distinct compositions with all four containing fucose, xylose, galactose and glucuronic acid.
 Predominant differences were observed in the quantities of rhamnose, arabinose, and glucose.

 We report 9 patients with an isolated infarct of the anterior part of the rostral cerebellum, ie, the territory of the lateral branch of the superior cerebellar artery.
 Clinicoanatomic correlations are based on CT, MRI, or both in 8 patients and on pathologic data in the ninth.
 The main clinical features were ipsilateral dysmetria and axial lateropulsion, dysarthria, and unsteadiness.
 In 1 patient, the clinical presentation mimicked a lacunar stroke (dysarthria and clumsy hand syndrome).
 There were no edematous cerebellar infarcts with signs of brainstem compression, and all patients spontaneously improved without significant sequellae.
 Angiography in 2 patients and pathologic examination of arteries in 1 patient disclosed no occlusion in the vertebrobasilar system.
 Six patients had a cardiac source of emboli.
 In conclusion, infarcts of the anterior part of the rostral cerebellum can be regarded as a benign condition in which there is, frequently, a cardiac source of emboli.

 A rehabilitation program for a patient with a neuromuscular disease can be developed only after an accurate diagnosis has been established.
 The diagnosis and its ramifications should suggest a natural course of disease which, it is hoped, can be improved upon with a rational and realistic program.
 The program is best developed by an interdisciplinary team, including a pediatric neurologist, who should have the greatest understanding of the patient's problem and should ultimately be responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the program.
 A child with cerebral palsy commonly requires the services of physical and occupational therapists as well as knowledgeable orthopedists.
 Is the program appropriate? Does it consider the child's potential as well as his limitations? A child with a traumatic brain injury requires, in addition to the above, psychological intervention and an intensive educational program.
 Will the child and family need help from mental health professionals? A child with a motor unit disease such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy requires, in addition to the above services, a ""philosophy"" of care.
 Will the child ever ambulate independently? If so, at what cost? What will be necessary for the child to reach this potential, including items such as orthoses and adaptive equipment? Will respirator care become necessary? What issues must be addressed for this form of care to be established? There is no one program for all children.
 The programs must be individualized to meet the needs of the patient and the family.

 We report four cases of fatal mercury vapor inhalation, a rare occurrence.
 The mercury vapor was released at a private home, where one of the occupants was smelting silver from dental amalgam containing an unknown amount of mercury.
 Within 24 hours of the incident, all occupants began having shortness of breath necessitating hospital admission.
 The clinical courses are briefly detailed; however, all included rapid deterioration with respiratory failure.
 Chest roentgenograms in all four cases were consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 All patients were treated with dimercaprol, a mercury chelator, but all died, with survival varying from 9 to 23 days postexposure.
 Autopsies were performed on all four patients.
 The lungs in all cases were heavy, firm, and airless.
 Histologic examination revealed severe diffuse alveolar damage, with variable amounts of fibrosis, conforming with acute lung injury in various stages of organization.
 Additional postmortem findings included acute proximal renal tubular necrosis, vacuolar hepatoxicity, and a spectrum of central nervous system alterations including multifocal ischemic necrosis, gliosis, and vasculitis.

1870,"Occurrence and repetition of hospital admissions for accidents in preschool children 
 OBJECTIVES--To examine trends over time in the rates of admission to hospital for accidents of preschool children and to study patterns of repeated admissions for accidents in these children.
 DESIGN--Analysis of linked, routine abstracts of hospital inpatient records for accidents.
 SETTING--Six districts in the Oxford Regional Health Authority covered by the Oxford record linkage study.
 SUBJECTS--Records for 19,427 children aged 5 years and under at the time of first recorded admission to hospital.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Number of admissions to hospital.
 RESULTS--Records were analysed in three groups: person based annual admission rates were calculated for each calendar year; each child's first recorded admission in 1976-85 was identified, and the child's record was followed up by linkage for one year from that admission; each child's first recorded admission in 1976-81 was identified and followed up for five years.
 Overall, 19,427 children from an average annual resident population of 163,000 children in 1976-86 had 20,657 admissions for accidents before they were 6 years of age.
 Of these admissions 13,983 were for injuries, 5717 for poisonings, and 957 for burns.
 Admission rates declined after 1976 for poisoning, but no substantial changes over time were found in admission rates for injuries or burns.
 A total of 17,724 children were followed up for one year and 10,889 for five years; 470 (2.6%) of the children who were followed up for one year and 926 (8.5%) of those followed up for five years had at least one further admission for an accident.
 Of those followed up for one year the 4 and 5 year old children were least likely and those under 1 and 1 year old were most likely to have a further admission for an accident.
 The number of children who had more than one accident was greater than would be expected if accidents were random occurrences.
 Those who had a poisoning at first admission were more likely to have another poisoning than an injury or burn; and those who had a burn at first admission were more likely to have another burn.
 CONCLUSIONS--Hospital admissions for accidents in children are common: on average 1 child in 88 in this population was admitted each year.
 Multiple admissions are uncommon but none the less occur more often than would be expected by chance.

1871,"Imaging techniques in the diagnosis of carcinoma of the colon.
 The variability in the published results for colonoscopy and barium enema examinations is confusing.
 With both, optimum results are dependent on meticulous preparation, technical excellence, and operator proficiency.
 It is a mistake to place colonoscopy and the barium enema in competitive positions; the two methods ideally complement one another in the evaluation of high risk individuals, including those with positive Hemoccult tests.
 The exclusion of significant pathology by the double-contrast enema can be relied on and is less costly to the patient.
 Detection of abnormalities by a barium enema should, when necessary, be followed by colonoscopic verification and/or biopsy.
 When used in this sequence, the procedures provide a cost-effective approach to the early detection and control of cancer; it is estimated that observance of the ACS guidelines can reduce mortality rates by 30%.

 Adenosine agonists and antagonists dose dependently accentuated and attenuated, respectively, ethanol-induced motor incoordination, thereby suggesting a central mechanism of adenosine modulation of this effect of ethanol and confirmed our previous reports in which adenosine agonists and antagonists were given i.p.
 Enprofylline, a weak adenosine antagonist but potent inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, did not alter ethanol's motor incoordination, further supporting involvement of brain adenosine receptor mechanism(s) in ethanol-adenosine interactions.
 Results from R-PIA and N6-(S-phenylisopropyl)adenosine experiments showed nearly a 40-fold greater potency of R-vs.

 However, 5'-(N-cyclopropyl)-carboxamidoadenosine data indicate complexity of the mechanism(s) and point toward an additional involvement of a yet unknown subtype of adenosine A2.
 No effect of ethanol on blood or brain levels of [3H]R-PIA was noted and sufficient amount of the latter entered the brain to suggest adenosine receptor activation adequate to produce behavioral interaction with ethanol.
 There was no escape of i.c.v.-administered [3H]R-PIA from brain to the peripheral circulation ruling out a peripheral and supporting a central mechanism of ethanol-adenosine interaction.

 The appearance of the proximal lumbar spinal nerves at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has not, to the authors' knowledge, been described.
 MR images and exactly corresponding sections obtained from four cadavers by means of a freezing microtome were correlated to characterize the MR appearance of the proximal spinal nerves.
 The junction of the dorsal and ventral rami with the dorsal and ventral roots consists of a group of six to 15 fascicles measuring 2-6 mm in length.
 These fascicles appear in MR images obtained with short repetition times as small foci of lower signal intensity than that of surrounding fat.
 The proximal spinal nerve and its relationship to the intervertebral disk and osseous margins of the neural foramen can be demonstrated effectively with MR imaging.

 Magnetic resonance images of the knee were made for 1014 patients, and the diagnosis was subsequently confirmed arthroscopically.
 The accuracy of the diagnoses from the imaging was 89 per cent for the medial meniscus, 88 per cent for the lateral meniscus, 93 per cent for the anterior cruciate ligament, and 99 per cent for the posterior cruciate ligament.
 The magnetic resonance examinations were done at several centers, and the results varied substantially among centers.
 The accuracy ranged from 64 to 95 per cent for the medial meniscus, from 83 to 94 per cent for the lateral meniscus, and from 78 to 97 per cent for the anterior cruciate ligament.
 The results from different magnetic-resonance units were also compared, and the findings suggested increased accuracy for the units that had a stronger magnetic field.
 Of the menisci for which the magnetic resonance signal was reported to be Grade II (a linear intrameniscal signal not extending to the superior or inferior meniscal surface), 17 per cent were found to be torn at arthroscopy.

 The hamster mAb 145-2C11 specific for the CD3 complex of murine T lymphocytes shares many properties with OKT3, including the induction of T cell activation.
 In vivo, the injection of 145-2C11 entails a variety of pathologic changes in relation to the systemic release of cytokines.
 We tested the effects on this cytokine release syndrome of different doses of methylprednisolone (m-PDS) given at various intervals of time before the 145-2C11 mAb.
 The administration of high doses of m-PDS (50 mg/kg) 2 to 3 h before the mAb resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the systemic release of TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-6.
 As far as the pathologic changes are concerned, the hypothermia, the acute renal tubular necrosis, and the fatty infiltration of the liver were completely prevented whereas the hypoglycemia was only partially attenuated.
 The protective effect of m-PDS on the toxicity of 145-2C11 was confirmed by the reduction of the mortality rate among galactosamine-sensitized mice.
 The inhibition of the release of cytokines by m-PDS did not affect the immunosuppression triggered by 145-2C11 as assessed by the CTL activity against alloantigens measured 48 h after the injection of the mAb.
 We conclude that the administration of very high doses of glucocorticoids 2 to 3 h before 145-2C11 prevents the release of cytokines and attenuates the acute toxicity of the mAb.
 Similar protocols could allow mitigation of the cytokine-release syndrome induced by the OKT3 mAb in man.

 SETTING--The British Olympic Medical Centre, Northwick Park Hospital.
 PATIENTS--46 Elite female athletes comprising 19 rowers, 18 runners, and nine dancers, of whom 25 were amenorrhoeic and 21 eumenorrhoeic.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Trabecular bone mineral density of the lumbar spine measured by computed tomography.
 RESULTS--Mean trabecular bone mineral density was 42 mg/cm3 (95% confidence interval 22 to 62 mg/cm3) lower in the amenorrhoeic than the eumenorrhoeic athletes; this difference was highly significant (p = 0.0002).

 OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of an elevated (greater than 30 mm/h) Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for predicting early relapse and survival after therapy in patients with clinical stage I or II Hodgkin disease.
 INTERVENTIONS: We studied 772 patients with early-stage Hodgkin disease who had participated in two separate multicenter clinical trials.
 Both trials used modern field radiotherapy and, in some patients, multi-agent chemotherapy.
 MAIN RESULTS: The ESR patterns were based on pretherapy and post-therapy assessments: pattern 1, always normal (n = 261); pattern 2, elevated before therapy but normal immediately after therapy (n = 121); pattern 3, elevated before therapy but normal within 3 months after therapy (n = 89); pattern 4, always elevated (n = 48); pattern 5, normal before therapy but oscillating between normal and elevated after therapy (n = 150); pattern 6, elevated before therapy but oscillating between normal and elevated after therapy (n = 130).
 By multivariate analysis, independent of whether or not patients received chemotherapy in the initial therapy protocol, ESR patterns 4, 5, and 6 were shown to be the best predictors for early relapse and survival when patients were stratified according to the type of chemotherapy received and the number of involved nodal areas.
 Patients with ESR pattern 4 had a relative risk for death seven times that of patients with patterns 1, 2, or 3.
 Early relapse was the second most important factor predicting death, irrespective of ESR; patients with early relapse and ESR patterns 1, 2, or 3 had a relative risk for death of 4.5, and those with early relapse and ESR patterns 4, 5, or 6 had a relative risk for death of 15.
 Whether or not chemotherapy was given initially did not change the relative risk, which shows that ESR, not initial therapy, was the predictor for early relapse and death due to Hodgkin disease.
 CONCLUSION: An unexplained elevated ESR after therapy, especially after modern radiotherapy, independent of other factors, strongly suggest the presence of aggressive and resistant Hodgkin disease.
 An elevated ESR is predictive of early relapse and poor prognosis; its presence justifies early aggressive therapy.

 Quantitative two-dimensional (2-D) and Doppler echocardiography were used to determine whether hemodialysis results in alterations in left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling that might contribute to dialysis-induced hypotension, as well as to assess whether any hemodynamic variables or indices of diastolic filling might be used to identify which patients were at the greatest risk of becoming hemodynamically unstable during dialysis.
 Sixteen male patients undergoing routine maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease were prospectively studied before and after hemodialysis.
 Following hemodialysis there was a significant prolongation (P less than 0.05) in LV isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), as well as a significant reduction in the rate and extent of early rapid ventricular filling (P less than 0.005); in contrast, late atrial-assisted filling did not change significantly.
 A multiple stepwise linear regression analysis of predialysis hemodynamic parameters and noninvasive indices of LV filling showed that there was a significant independent inverse relationship between the frequency of dialysis-related hypotensive episodes and the duration of early LV filling (r = -0.81; P less than 0.001).
 These results suggest that hemodialysis results in discrete alterations in early LV filling, with no significant compensatory increase in late atrial-assisted ventricular filling.
 Further, patients with the shortest early LV filling times appeared to have the greatest predilection for becoming hemodynamically unstable during dialysis.

 The animals were studied before operation and at 4-weekly intervals for 20 weeks after operation.
 Mortality rates were similar.
 Ileal compliance was increased significantly by myectomy from 0.64 ml/mmHg (median, interquartile range 0.49-0.78) after ileo-anal anastomosis alone to 1.65 mmHg (1.16-1.93), P less than 0.01, an increase which was maintained.
 Ileal capacity was also increased both by myectomy and by the J pouch: ileo-anal anastomosis = 85 ml (75-100 ml), ileo-anal anastomosis and myectomy = 139 ml (116-156 ml), ileo-anal anastomosis and myectomy and ileo-ileal valve = 125 ml (range 85-145 ml), ileo-anal anastomosis and J pouch = 130 ml (range 75-165 ml) (P less than 0.01).
 Bowel function in the other three groups was markedly superior to ileo-anal anastomosis alone.
 Mean transit time was significantly less after ileo-anal anastomosis, 5.2 h (2.6-8.2 h) than after both ileo-anal anastomosis and myectomy, 10.5 h (9.6-13.9 h), P less than 0.05 and ileo-anal anastomosis and J pouch, 11.0 h (8.4-13.0 h), P less than 0.05, but addition of an ileo-ileal valve did not produce a further increase in transit time, 12.9 h (range 10.5-14.5 h), P = n.s.

 The mean concentration of PICP in would fluid on day 1 was 207 +/- 92 (SD) micrograms/L, and on day 2 908 +/- 469 micrograms/L (p less than 0.001, signed rank test).
 On day 7, the mean concentration reached was 380 times higher than that of day 1 (79,330 +/- 54,151 micrograms/L).
 Only one peak of PICP antigenicity, corresponding to the intact propeptide as set free during synthesis of type I procollagen, was detected on Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration analysis of wound fluid samples.

 The role of calcium as a mediator in neuronal death during ischemia is now quite strong.
 Evidence supporting this link includes studies in cell cultures and measurements of calcium accumulation in the mitochondria during ischemia, as well as direct measurements of shifts in extracellular calcium using microelectrodes.
 Since it is dangerously high concentrations of the intracellular free calcium that have been hypothesized to lead to neuronal damage, direct in vivo measurements of this parameter in ischemia are important.
 A technique for the measurement of intracellular free calcium is described, along with data from studies that dramatically demonstrate the time course of changes in intracellular free calcium induced by focal ischemia.
 Additional data are also presented that indicate that cellular damage can be attenuated by the use of agents that block calcium channels (nimodipine, which blocks voltage-sensitive calcium channels, and MK-801, which blocks receptor-operated channels) and support the concept that these agents owe their beneficial effects to their ability to reduce the accumulation of intracellular calcium.

1893,"Reversible myeloneuropathy of nitrous oxide abuse: serial electrophysiological studies.
 Detailed electrophysiological studies were performed in 4 patients with myeloneuropathy induced by abuse of nitrous oxide for 1 to 4 years.
 All presented with paresthesias, weakness, and Lhermitte's phenomena, and exhibited signs of sensorimotor polyneuropathy, ataxia, and arreflexia.
 Two had subnormal serum vitamin B12 levels.
 Baseline electrophysiologic testing revealed reduced motor unit potentials, prolonged F wave latencies, absent H reflexes, denervation potentials, and delays in motor and sensory conduction.
 Three had peripheral and nuchal delay after median nerve stimulation.
 All were reevaluated after 3 to 12 months' abstinence and treatment with vitamin B12, and all showed substantial clinical improvement.
 Parallel improvement in electrophysiologic findings occurred, but residual minor conduction delays, loss of H reflexes, electromyographic evidence of denervation, or abnormalities of posterior tibial SEP were noted.
 These findings confirm the reversibility of myeloneuropathy of nitrous oxide abuse and describe the profile of electrophysiologic recovery in subjects who abstain from further neurotoxic exposure.

1896,"The erythrocyte sedimentation rate in congestive heart failure.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS.
 Physicians have long believed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is low in patients with congestive heart failure, but this concept is based on a misinterpretation of the results in a single report published in 1936.
 To reevaluate this concept in the modern era, we measured the sedimentation rate in 242 patients who were referred for treatment of chronic heart failure.
 RESULTS.
 The sedimentation rate was low (less than 5 mm per hour) in only 24 patients (10 percent) but was increased (above 25 mm per hour) in 50 percent.
 Patients with low or normal sedimentation rates (less than or equal to 25 mm per hour) had more severe hemodynamic abnormalities than patients with elevated rates: lower cardiac index (mean +/- SEM, 1.7 +/- 0.1 vs.
 2.0 +/- 0.1 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area) and higher mean right atrial pressure (mean +/- SEM, 12 +/- 1 vs.
 9 +/- 1 mm Hg) (both P less than 0.0001).
 New York Heart Association functional class IV symptoms were present in 66 percent of the patients with a low or normal sedimentation rate, as compared with 42 percent of those with elevated rates (P less than 0.0001).
 After one to three months of therapy, patients whose sedimentation rates decreased showed little hemodynamic or clinical response to treatment, whereas both cardiac performance and functional status improved in patients whose rates increased (P less than 0.02 for the comparison between groups).
 The sedimentation rate was correlated with the plasma fibrinogen level (r = 0.64, P = 0.0025), and changes in the sedimentation rate during treatment were correlated inversely with changes in mean right atrial pressure (r = -0.57, P = 0.0002).
 During long-term follow-up, patients with low or normal sedimentation rates had a worse one-year survival than patients with elevated rates (41 vs.
 66 percent, P = 0.01).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 These data indicate that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is correlated with the severity of illness in patients with chronic heart failure.
 Because of its lack of discriminatory power, however, the test is of limited value in the clinical management of this disorder.

 Subscapular elastofibromas and scapulothoracic bursitis can cause symptomatic masses in baseball pitchers.
 Both processes appear to represent reactive soft tissue responses to repetitive stress at the inferior border of the scapula.
 It is assumed that most masses in the subscapular area represent scapulothoracic bursitis rather than an elastofibroma.
 However, it is possible that some of the masses treated conservatively as scapulothoracic bursitis may be elastofibromas.
 A study is currently under way to evaluate the incidence of subscapular masses in college and professional pitchers in the United States.

 Histologically, PSCN was characterized by symmetrical proliferation of spindle-shaped pigmented melanocytes grouped in large junctional nests.
 Pagetoid spread of single cells in the overlying epidermis was frequently found.
 In our opinion, PSCN is a distinctive benign acquired melanocytic naevus that in the past has been frequently misdiagnosed as atypical Spitz naevi or malignant melanoma.

 The implant-tissue response to the silicone gel mammary prosthesis requires a more thorough evaluation in light of recent concerns related to human connective-tissue diseases, contracture, infection, and neoplasia.
 The silicone prosthesis is not a homogeneous implant but is a milieu of various silicone chemistries.
 Silicone polymer precursors and prosthesis components (silicone shells, shells extracted of their low-molecular-weight components, silica-free silicone, silicone oil, fumed silica, and silicone extract) were implanted subcutaneously using a nonhemorrhagic technique into the backs of Lew/SsN rats (n = 90), two implants per rat, for periods of 7, 14, 28, 56, and 90 days for a total of 6 implants per material per time period.
 Histologic analysis was performed on specimens from the harvested soft tissue.
 The intensity of the cellular and capsular response was lowest for the silicone oil and increased as the material's molecular weight increased and material compliance decreased.
 Fumed silica elicited the most highly reactive cellular response.
 From this study it is apparent that the polymer's molecular weight influences its migration, encapsulation, and intensity of cellular response.
 Further, the silicone extract distillate elicited a highly intense cellular response with pronounced lymphocyte invasion.
 The human relevance of this work awaits further correlation with implant retrieval and in vivo performance.

1900,"Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and electrocardiographic effects of intravenous verapamil with intravenous calcium chloride pretreatment in normal subjects.
 To evaluate the effects of calcium pretreatment on the disposition and electrocardiographic effects of verapamil, 8 healthy male volunteers received treatment in each of 3 phases in a randomized, double-blind, crossover manner.
 Phase I denoted 10 ml of 0.9% intravenous sodium chloride followed by 10 mg of intravenous verapamil; phase II denoted 10 ml of 10% intravenous calcium chloride followed by 4 ml of 0.9% intravenous sodium chloride; and phase III denoted 10 ml of 10% intravenous calcium chloride followed by 10 mg of intravenous verapamil.
 Blood samples for the determination of verapamil concentrations were drawn at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes, and at 2, 4, 6, 10 and 24 hours.
 Blood pressure, heart rate and PR intervals were also measured at these times.
 Pretreatment of verapamil with intravenous calcium did not alter the disposition of intravenous verapamil.
 Blood pressure was not significantly altered in any treatment phase, although calcium tended to increase mean arterial pressure and verapamil abolished this effect.
 Calcium had no significant affect on verapamil-induced PR prolongation (maximum percent change in PR interval: phase I = 19 +/- 11%, phase III = 18 +/- 7%; time to maximal prolongation: phase I = 0.38 +/- 0.21 hours, phase III = 0.37 +/- 0.26 hours; and area under the percent change in PR vs time curve: phase I = 15.5 +/- 10, phase III = 21 +/- 9).
 Verapamil caused a reflex increase in heart rate of similar magnitude in both phases I and III (24 +/- 10% and 21 +/- 7%, respectively).

 Prospective data was recorded on 217 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) procedures performed in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries over an 8-year period.
 After the initial procedure, patients were followed with serial noninvasive studies and, in 71 patients, repeat angiography.
 The mean follow-up period was 7 years (range, 2-11 years).
 Standard life-table survival analysis was used to assess the factors potentially affecting long-term outcome.
 Excluding an initial technical failure rate of 10%, overall patencies at 1, 3, and 5 years were 81%, 61%, and 58%, respectively.
 After the first year, the prognosis (i.e., failure rate) appears to be linear over the long term (i.e., up to 10 years).
 Factors negatively influencing long-term patency include the presence of diabetes mellitus, diffuse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or threatened limb loss.
 Technical factors correlated with failure include lesion length, moderate eccentricity, and a poor post-PTA appearance.

 Cholecystectomy remains the most effective form of therapy for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis.
 An alternative method of gallbladder removal, laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy, was attempted in 100 patients.
 Five patients required conversion of the laparoscopic procedure to an open laparotomy for the following reasons: discovery of a pancreatic malignancy in one patient, extensive adhesions in one, presence of an aberrant accessory right hepatic duct in one, common hepatic duct injury in one, and avulsion of the cystic duct in one.
 Both ductal injuries occurred during the early phase of the clinical program.
 In those patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 93 were discharged within 24 hours of surgery and 94 returned to normal activity within 1 week.
 Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy appears to offer a number of advantages in patient care as well as a significant reduction in health care expenses for gallbladder disease.

1903,"Management issues for trauma patients with alcohol.
 An estimated 20-25% of patients treated in emergency departments or as inpatients for trauma have been drinking and most of them have BACs of 0.10 gm/dL (22 mmol/L) or higher.
 Many are problem drinkers or alcoholics, smokers, and also abuse other drugs.
 Both acute ingestion and chronic abuse of alcohol increase the frequency and severity of injury, and may complicate patient management by mimicking head trauma, masking intra-abdominal injury, causing circulatory collapse, reducing immune response, altering hepatic metabolism, or causing delirium tremens.
 Proper management of a trauma patient with alcohol includes BAC determination, careful history taking for alcoholism with referral for further evaluation or treatment when indicated, and determination whether other drugs are also being misused.
 Failure to do these may put a physician at legal risk both for improper care of the patient and for exposing others to injury if the patient crashes after being discharged from the emergency department while still impaired by alcohol.

 We investigated the use of ultralow profile balloon catheters (Scimed ACE, USCI Probe, Cordis, Orion) for coronary angioplasty through 6 French diagnostic catheters (Schneider, Cordis).
 Contrast injection was assisted with a Hercules pump (Cordis) in all cases.
 During 21 procedures, angioplasty of 27 lesions in 20 selected patients was attempted (1.3 lesion/procedure).
 Twelve lesions were in the right, 10 in the left anterior descending, and 5 in the left circumflex coronary artery.
 Balloon size varied between 2.5 and 3.5 mm.
 Twenty lesions could be successfully dilated (74%) through the 6 French catheter and 7 lesions required an exchange to a 7 French angioplasty guiding catheter.
 For 5 cases, another balloon was also necessary to complete the procedure.
 The final overall success rate was 100% per patient and per lesion and there were no major complications.
 Despite the small internal catheter lumen (1.22 mm) coronary visualization was adequate, and mechanical support was good.
 Failures of 6 French catheters were attributed to insufficient torque control and excessive friction when the balloon crossed the tapered end of the diagnostic catheter.
 Coronary angioplasty through a diagnostic 6 French catheter is feasible and may represent a reasonable alternative for simple cases that are done during the same session as the diagnostic angiography.
 Once available, 6 French high flow angioplasty guiding catheters without a tapered tip should improve success while retaining the advantage of a small femoral puncture site.

 Technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxy-2-isobutyl-isonitrile (technetium-99m isonitrile) is a new radiopharmaceutical compound that reflects myocardial perfusion.
 Its kinetics, especially its lack of redistribution after intravenous administration, permits the assessment of changes in myocardial perfusion without delay of therapy.
 Tomographic images at rest were obtained immediately and 6 to 10 days later in 17 consecutive patients undergoing successful primary angioplasty during their first transmural myocardial infarction.
 Thirteen patients had anterior infarction.
 The initial (acute) defect size before angioplasty of 48 +/- 17% of the left ventricle decreased significantly (p less than 0.0001) to 29 +/- 19% on the late scans.
 There was no correlation between the time to therapy and the reduction in defect size.
 Twelve of the 17 patients, including 7 of the 11 patients treated after 4 h, demonstrated a definite reduction in the initial defect size.
 Eight patients with angiographically proved persistent coronary occlusion underwent a similar imaging sequence.
 The initial defect size in this group remained unchanged on the late scans (24 +/- 16% versus 26 +/- 18%, p = NS).
 Primary angioplasty is an effective approach toward salvaging myocardium; comparison with thrombolytic drug therapy must await the results of controlled clinical trials.

 We studied 50 patients with fractures of the femoral neck, 33 intracapsular and 17 extracapsular.
 Intraosseous pressure was measured by a transducer within the bone to quantify blood flow, and intracapsular pressure by a needle introduced into the joint space.
 The mean intracapsular pressure was lower in the extracapsular fractures.
 In these, the mean intraosseous pressure in the femoral head was unchanged by aspiration of the joint.
 However in the intracapsular fractures aspiration produced a significant decrease in intra-osseous pressure and an increase in pulse pressure within the femoral head.
 The results suggest that aspiration of intracapsular haematoma produced an increase in femoral head blood flow by relieving tamponade.

 Two cases of the so-called ovarian myxoma are reported.
 One was from a 13-year-old girl who had a 31-year follow-up and no evidence of recurrence.
 The second case, from a 65-year-old woman, recurred intraperitoneally, 19 years after the surgery.
 Both tumors were myxoid, with round to stellate cells.
 Immunohistochemical, electron microscopic (EM), and DNA flow cytometric (FCM) studies were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of the second patient on both the primary tumor and the recurrence.
 Tumor cells expressed vimentin and were focally positive for desmin and myoglobin.
 EM findings suggested a fibroblastic differentiation.
 An aneuploid cell population was present in the recurrent tumor by DNA-FCM studies.
 Only four other cases of so-called ovarian myxoma were reported to date, and the follow-up does not exceed 18 months.
 The authors conclude that the presence of aneuploidy and the late recurrence of one of their cases suggest that certain ovarian myxomas might behave like low-grade sarcomas.
 The histogenesis of this tumor remains unsettled, but similarities were found with myxomas in other locations.

 The concentrations of free and peptide-bound amino acids aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu), glycine (Gly) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were studied following ischemia and recirculation in the ventral and dorsal gray matter of the rabbit spinal cord.
 No changes in the concentration of amino acids following ten minutes (min) of ischemia and four days of recovery were found.
 The most significant change after 20 min, and especially 40 min, of ischemia was a decrease in free Asp and GABA levels in both parts of the gray matter.
 The relatively greater decrease in the concentration of free amino acids in the ventral horns corresponds with the greater morphological damage to this part of spinal cord following ischemia.
 Following 40 min of ischemia and recirculation decrease in peptide-bound Glu in the ventral horns and Asp and Glu in the dorsal horns was found.

 REE, measured over 20-40 min by indirect calorimetry using a ventilated canopy, averaged 0.98 +/- 0.15 kcal/min on day 3 and decreased to 0.93 +/- 0.15 kcal/min on day 8-9 postsurgery (p less than 0.02).
 REE was positively correlated with body weight (r = 0.69, p less than 0.005).

 The autonomic components of the baroreflex control of heart rate were evaluated in conscious mongrel dogs before and after 4-6 weeks of ventricular pacing (250 beats/min).
 Arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was determined by the slopes of linear regression of pulse interval versus the preceding systolic arterial pressure in response to bolus injections of either phenylephrine or nitroglycerin.
 BRS was significantly depressed in the heart failure state [nitroglycerin slope, 5.0 +/- 2.7 (mean +/- SD) versus 16.6 +/- 5.1 msec/mm Hg, p less than 0.005; phenylephrine slope, 15.0 +/- 14.8 versus 32.0 +/- 26.7 msec/mm Hg, p less than 0.005].
 There was no depression in BRS in dogs that were used as time controls or were acutely paced for 30 minutes.
 After beta 1-adrenergic blockade with metoprolol, the resting heart rate in the heart failure state was depressed more than in the normal state (-17.0 +/- 5.0% versus -3.2 +/- 3.4%, p less than 0.001).
 Atropine significantly increased resting heart rate more in the normal state than in the heart failure state (115.8 +/- 36.7% versus 25.4 +/- 14.5%, p less than 0.005).
 Thus, dogs in the heart failure state appear to have high resting cardiac sympathetic tone and low resting vagal tone.

 The Minnesota Heart Survey examined trends of Q wave and non-Q wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using a 50% random sample of all hospital discharges of patients with AMI or another acute coronary disease from 35 of 36 hospitals in 1970 and 30 of 31 hospitals in 1980 in the Minneapolis-St.
 Paul metropolitan area.
 A total of 1,901 and 1,864 potential AMI cases were abstracted in 1970 and 1980, respectively.
 Electrocardiograms were coded according to the Minnesota code.
 AMIs were validated by computerized algorithm based on chest pain, enzymes, electrocardiograms, and autopsy.
 This study shows that with the use of a consistent, standard diagnostic algorithm, attack rates for Q wave AMI did not change significantly between 1970 and 1980 and that attack rates for non-Q wave AMI decreased significantly during the same decade.
 However, when the more sensitive cardiac enzymes creatine phosphokinase and creatine phosphokinase-MB were considered, attack rates of both Q wave and non-Q wave AMIs increased.
 This research documents four important trends for community AMI rates that are at variance with those reported by others.
 There was a decline in non-Q wave AMI attack rates from 1970 to 1980; women had outcomes equal to or worse than those for men for both case-fatality and 7-year survival rates; patients with non-Q wave AMIs had worse in-hospital prognoses than those with Q wave AMIs; and 7-year survival rates were worse for Q wave AMI in 1980.
 These findings demonstrate the need for standard diagnostic criteria for Q wave and non-Q wave AMI if trends are to be monitored.
 In the future, as new trials of operative and nonoperative therapies of AMI are undertaken, these considerations will increase in importance.

 OBJECTIVE--To determine whether serum sialic acid concentration may be used to predict short and long term cardiovascular mortality.
 DESIGN--Prospective study on all men and women who had their serum sialic acid concentration measured as part of a general health survey in 1964 or in 1965.
 All were followed up for an average of 20.5 years.
 SETTING--Geographical part of the county of Varmland, Sweden.
 SUBJECTS--Residents in the area participating in a health check up in 1964-5 (27,065 men and 28,037 women), of whom 372 men (169 with incomplete data and 203 lost to follow up) and 345 women (143 and 202 respectively) were excluded; thus 26,693 men and 27,692 women entered the study.
 The study sample was restricted to subjects aged 40-74 during any of the 20 years' follow up.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Serum sialic acid concentration, serum cholesterol concentration, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index at the general health survey visit; cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular deaths during three periods of follow up (0-6 years, 7-13 years, and 14-20 years), according to the Swedish mortality register, in subjects aged 45-74.
 RESULTS--Mean serum sialic acid concentration (mg/100 ml) was 68.8 (SD 8.0) for men and 69.2 (8.0) for women; the average concentration increasing with age in both sexes.
 A total of 5639 (21%) men and 3307 (12%) women died during the follow up period, in whom death in 3052 (54%) men and 1368 (41%) women was from cardiovascular causes.
 During short (0-6 years), medium (7-13 years), and long (14-20 years) term follow up the relative risk of death from cardiovascular disease increased with increasing serum sialic acid concentration.
 The relative risk (95% confidence interval) associated with the highest quartile of sialic acid concentration compared with the lowest quartile was 2.38 (2.01 to 2.83) in men and 2.62 (1.93 to 3.57) in women.
 Similar results were found for deaths from non-cardiovascular disease with relative risks of 1.50 (1.34 to 2.68) in men and 1.89 (1.57 to 2.28) in women, but these relative risks were significantly lower than those for deaths from cardiovascular disease (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.005 respectively).
 In multivariate analysis of total mortality and of cardiovascular mortality with sialic acid concentration, serum cholesterol concentration, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index as independent variables the impact of sialic acid concentration was virtually the same as in univariate analysis.
 CONCLUSION--Serum sialic acid concentration is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality.
 A possible explanation of these findings is that the serum sialic acid concentration may reflect the existence or the activity of an atherosclerotic process, and this may warrant further investigation.

 The hetrazepine WEB 2170 (international nonproprietary name: bepafant), a thieno-triazolodiazepine that is structurally related to the recently described platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist WEB 2086, is a potent and selective PAF antagonist both in vitro and in vivo.
 WEB 2170 inhibited PAF-induced human platelet and neutrophil aggregation in vitro (IC50 values: 0.3 and 0.83 microM, respectively) but had little or no inhibitory action against aggregation induced by other agonists.
 The potency in vitro was comparable to that described recently for WEB 2086 (Casals-Stenzel, J., Muacevic, G.

 When guinea pigs were given i.v.
 infusions of PAF at 30 ng x kg-1 x min-1, oral (0.005-0.5 mg/kg) as well as intravenous (0.005-0.05 mg/kg) treatment with WEB 2170 abrogated the intrathoracic accumulation of 111In-labeled platelets, the bronchoconstriction and the hypotension as well as the finally occurring death in a dose-dependent fashion.
 Oral (0.01-1 mg/kg) and intravenous (0.005-0.1 mg/kg) WEB 2170 shared with the beta 2 agonist fenoterol and the steroid dexamethasone the property of protecting elderly NMRI mice from the lethal effect of PAF.
 In anesthetized rats, intravenous (0.001-0.1 mg/kg) and oral (0.05-1 mg/kg) WEB 2170 inhibited PAF-induced hypotension in a dose-related manner.
 Coadministration of WEB 2170 inhibited PAF-induced increase of vascular permeability in rat skin very effectively.
 The half-time of duration of action in the rat was estimated to be about 5 to 6 h after oral administration and about 1.1 to 2.3 h after intravenous application.
 In conclusion, the hetrazepine WEB 2170 is a strong and selective PAF antagonist, which is in vitro more or less equipotent to WEB 2086.
 In contrast, in vivo oral WEB 2170 is--depending on the species and considered parameter--about 5 to 40 times more potent against exogenous PAF-induced alterations than the recently described hetrazepine WEB 2086.
 Particularly in mice and rats, oral WEB 2170 is by far superior to WEB 2086.

 Seventy-nine recreational athletes (average age, 26 years) with complete ACL tears were treated with nonligamentous arthroscopic surgery, monitored rehabilitation, functional bracing, and activity modification.
 The average followup was 52 months (range, 36 to 102 months).
 Six (8%) patients ultimately underwent ligament reconstruction and were considered failures of nonreconstructive treatment.
 The remaining 73 patients were the subject of detailed analysis.
 There were 9 (11%) excellent, 25 (32%) good, 17 (22%) fair, and 28 (35%) poor results.
 Although 71 patients (97%) were satisfied with their knee for activities of daily living, only 36 (49%) were satisfied with their knee for sports.
 Twenty-nine (40%) had significantly modified their athletic activities.
 Age, sex, interval from injury to treatment, associated meniscal tears (49 or 67%), and articular cartilage damage (21 or 29%) had no apparent effect on the outcome.
 Poor results were noted in 29 (40%) patients with significant pivot shifts.
 Multiple repeat injuries, repeat arthroscopy, isokinetic deficits, and increased length of followup were also associated with poor results.

1919,"Fluorometric determination of pseudocholinesterase activity in postmortem blood samples.
 A fluorometric assay using 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (HPPA) was conducted to determine the activity of pseudocholinesterase (ChE) [Enzyme Commission (EC) No.
 3.1.1.8] in postmortem blood samples so as to test for organophosphate poisoning.
 By the enzymatic reaction of ChE, its substrate, benzoylcholine, produces choline, which is oxidized by choline oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide.
 HPPA is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase to become the fluorogenic dimer whose concentration is measured fluorometrically at an excitation emission wavelength of 320 nm and an elimination emission wavelength of 404 nm.
 The selectivity and sensitivity of the present method were found to be superior to those of conventional pH and spectrophotometric methods.

1920,"The timed ""Up & Go"": a test of basic functional mobility for frail elderly persons.
 This study evaluated a modified, timed version of the ""Get-Up and Go"" Test (Mathias et al, 1986) in 60 patients referred to a Geriatric Day Hospital (mean age 79.5 years).
 The patient is observed and timed while he rises from an arm chair, walks 3 meters, turns, walks back, and sits down again.
 The results indicate that the time score is (1) reliable (inter-rater and intra-rater); (2) correlates well with log-transformed scores on the Berg Balance Scale (r = -0.81), gait speed (r = -0.61) and Barthel Index of ADL (r = -0.78); and (3) appears to predict the patient's ability to go outside alone safely.
 These data suggest that the timed ""Up & Go"" test is a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility that may also be useful in following clinical change over time.
 The test is quick, requires no special equipment or training, and is easily included as part of the routine medical examination.

1921,"Epithelial cells immortalized by human papillomaviruses have premalignant characteristics in organotypic culture.
 Three HPV-16--and four HPV-18--immortalized human foreskin keratinocyte cell lines were analyzed on organotypic epidermal raft cultures at various passage levels.
 This culture system allowed normal cultured keratinocytes to stratify and differentiate in a manner similar to normal epidermis.
 All seven HPV-immortalized cell lines displayed epidermal morphologies on organotypic cultures, which were clearly abnormal and resembled premalignant lesions in vivo.
 Features of premalignant lesions that were shared by all of the HPV-immortalized cell lines included disorganized tissue architecture, mitotic cells present throughout the living layers of the epidermal sheet, abnormal mitoses, enlarged nuclei, and variable cell size and shape.
 Most HPV-immortalized cell lines were stable in terms of epidermal morphology with long-term passage in culture.
 Two of the HPV-18--immortalized cell lines, however, lost all morphologically apparent terminal squamous differentiation potential after long-term passage in monolayer culture.
 These results strongly support the idea that immortalization of squamous epithelial cells in culture by HPV-transforming genes generates a morphologically premalignant cell.

1922,"Specificity of affective and autonomic symptoms of depression in Parkinson's disease.
 Previous investigators have suggested that numerous symptoms used to diagnose depression, such as sleep or appetite disturbance, are non-specific in medically ill patients, and alternative diagnostic criteria should be developed.
 In the study this hypothesis was tested in Parkinson's disease (PD) by comparing patients with PD who reported a depressive mood with patients having PD but without a depressive mood.
 Depressed patients showed a significantly higher frequency of both autonomic and affective symptoms of depression.
 Depressed patients with PD reported a significantly higher frequency of worrying, brooding, loss of interest, hopelessness, suicidal tendencies, social withdrawal, self-depreciation, ideas of reference, anxiety symptoms, loss of appetite, initial and middle insomnia, and loss of libido when compared with non-depressed patients.
 No significant between-group differences, however, were observed in the frequency of anergia, motor retardation, and early morning awakening.

1923,"Laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy in the staging of early carcinoma of the cervix.
 Laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 39 patients.
 An incision of the peritoneum between the round and infundibulo-pelvic ligament on each side gave access to the retroperitoneal space.
 Subsequently, laparoscopic surgery allowed precise dissection of external and internal iliac vessels, umbilical artery, and obturator nerve.
 The peritoneum was left open, and the lymph was drained into the peritoneal cavity.
 No lymphocele was observed.
 Three to 22 (mean, 8.7) nodes were removed, and there was no significant morbidity.
 Sensitivity and specificity were 100% in this preliminary experience.
 It is thus possible to remove the first-line regional lymph nodes of the cervix for pathologic examination.
 Because ""skip"" metastases are quite rare in early cervical carcinoma, the risk of missing a positive node is low.
 Brachytherapy alone, vaginal surgery, or, in microinvasive carcinoma, conization alone can be applied safely without the need of a staging laparotomy in cases with negative nodes.

1925,"The effect of financial management on alcohol-related hospitalization.
 OBJECTIVE: Treatment-unresponsive alcoholics in New Zealand who are unable to care for themselves tend to be hospitalized for lengthy periods of time.
 The author examined the effect of adding financial management to the therapeutic management of such patients.
 The null hypothesis was that this would have no effect on the duration of alcohol-related hospitalization.
 METHOD: All 61 alcoholic patients registered with an alcohol outpatient clinic who received financial management over a period of 6 years were included in the study.
 Their alcohol-related disabilities were so severe that they had resulted or were likely to result in lengthy or frequent periods of hospitalization.
 The financial management involved putting each patient's income into a checking account for which a budget advisory officer was cosignatory for withdrawals.
 The advisor saw to it that patients' basic living requirements were being met and that expenditure on alcohol was not having a detrimental effect.
 Participation was voluntary for voluntary patients and involuntary for committed patients.
 The durations of each patient's alcohol-related hospitalizations were compared for two equal periods of time before and after financial management was instituted.
 RESULTS: The null hypothesis was not supported.
 The duration of alcohol-related hospitalizations after financial management was instituted was 86% less than it was before such management.
 CONCLUSIONS: For the patient who is struggling in the face of excessive drinking to cope with the tasks of daily living, including the provision of adequate shelter and nutrition, the benefits of adding financial management to other therapeutic strategies should be considered.

1926,"Intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal organ injuries diagnosed on dynamic computed tomograms obtained for assessment of renal trauma.
 The efficacy of dynamic computed tomography in assessment of renal, intra-abdominal, and retroperitoneal organ injuries is analyzed in some 444 patients.
 This technique contributed most valuable information toward the diagnosis of such coexistent injuries in patients who sustained blunt trauma.
 CT identified associated abdominal or retroperitoneal organ injuries in 85% of the patients (277 of 324), clinical examination in only 26%.
 CT proved invaluable for assessment of injury to bowel and mesentery, pancreas, and retroperitoneal vascular structures, giving rise to hematomas.
 CT diagnosed all such injuries, clinical examination from 0% (pancreas) to 11% (retroperitoneal hematomas).
 In patients with penetrating injury, dynamic CTs added valuable information on the status of viability of the injured organs.
 A relatively high number of false positive diagnoses resulted in only four unnecessary explorations.
 In all other patients, the erroneous diagnosis was revealed on repeat CTs undertaken because of inconsistency of the clinical course and clinical findings with the initially suggested CT diagnosis or at time of exploration undertaken for correction of other confirmed injuries.
 Discovery of associated intra- or retroperitoneal organ injuries, particularly in patients who sustained blunt trauma, has resulted in modification of treatment which prevented late sequelae and complications and thereby substantially reduced hospitalization time.

1927,"Civilian gunshot wounds to the head: a prospective study.
 Previous retrospective studies of cranial gunshot wounds have failed to determine whether aggressive field resuscitation, triage to a neurosurgical center, and early surgical intervention can improve the assumed poor outcome of these severely injured patients.
 Therefore, we studied 100 consecutive patients prospectively to establish a systematic approach to treatment.
 If the patient retained two or more neurological signs after aggressive field resuscitation/intubation, a computed tomographic scan was performed.
 Rapid surgical debridement was done unless the patient deteriorated to clinical brain death.
 The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score after resuscitation was 3 to 5 in 58 patients, 6 to 8 in 8 patients, 9 to 12 in 12 patients, and 13 to 15 in 22 patients.
 Seventy-six computed tomographic scans and 43 craniotomies were performed.
 The Glasgow Outcome Scale scores showed that 60 patients died, 2 were vegetative, 6 were severely disabled, 20 were moderately disabled, and 13 had good outcomes.
 There were 10 postoperative deaths.
 No patient with a GCS score of 3 to 5 had a satisfactory outcome; however, outcome progressively improved as the GCS score increased.
 We conclude that all cranial gunshot patients should initially receive aggressive resuscitation.
 Patients with stable vital signs should be examined by computed tomographic scan.
 If the patient's GCS score after resuscitation is 3 to 5 and no operable hematomas are present, then no further therapy should be offered.
 All patients with a GCS score greater than 5 should receive aggressive surgical therapy.

1928,"The role of alpha adrenoceptor subtypes in sympathetic control of the acral-cutaneous microcirculation.
 In pithed and anesthetized rats, laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to evaluate the role of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors in mediating sympathetic responses in acral regions of the cutaneous circulation.
 The intravenous administration of the selective alpha-1 agonist, phenylephrine, was a more potent vasopressor agent than BH-T 933 (a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist) in pithed rats.
 However, BH-T 933 was more potent and more efficacious than phenylephrine in reducing cutaneous microvascular perfusion (CP).
 BH-T 933 also caused a greater increase in cutaneous microvascular resistance.
 Neural and humoral sympathetic effects on CP were characterized with selective alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists (prazosin and rauwolscine, respectively).
 It was found that frequency-related reductions in CP elicited by sciatic nerve stimulation were antagonized by prazosin, but not by rauwolscine.
 In fact, rauwolscine enhanced neurally evoked reductions in CP at the highest stimulation frequencies.
 However, both prazosin and rauwolscine antagonized reductions in CP elicited by electrical stimulation of the thoracolumbar outflow (sympathoadrenal activation).
 Ganglionic stimulation (intravenous 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium) also caused a profound, transient reduction in CP that was abolished by rauwolscine, but was not significantly altered by prazosin.
 In contrast, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium-induced increases in mean arterial pressure were reduced by prazosin, but not by rauwolscine.
 In ketamine-anesthetized rats, rauwolscine caused a dose-related increase in CP without altering mean arterial pressure, whereas prazosin lowered mean arterial pressure but did not alter CP.
 We conclude that acral regions of the cutaneous vasculature are more sensitive to alpha-2 vis-a-vis alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction.

1929,"Comparison of labetalol versus enalapril as monotherapy in elderly patients with hypertension: results of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
 PURPOSE: This study compared the safety and efficacy of labetalol and enalapril as antihypertensive therapy for elderly patients.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, open-label, parallel controlled trial was conducted.
 After completing a 4-week placebo phase, 79 elderly (65 years or older) patients with an average standing diastolic blood pressure (BP) 95 mm Hg or above and 114 mm Hg or less were randomized to receive a 12-week course of either labetalol or enalapril in an open-label design.
 The patients' BP and heart rate were evaluated biweekly by trained observers unaware of the treatment status, and drug dosage was titrated (up to 400 mg twice a day of labetalol or 40 mg daily of enalapril) to achieve a standing diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg and a decrease of 10 mm Hg from baseline.
 Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) at the end of the placebo phase and again after 8 weeks of active treatment.
 RESULTS: The treatment groups were comparable in their reduction of supine diastolic BP, with no significant differences between the two treatments.
 Labetalol demonstrated a significantly greater reduction (p less than 0.05) in standing diastolic BP at the end of the titration period compared to enalapril, but this difference was not significant by the end of the study period.
 Based on 24-hour ABPM readings, labetalol reduced mean 24-hour diastolic BP (p less than 0.05) and mean heart rate (p less than 0.05) more than enalapril.
 The labetalol-treated patients were significantly less often above their diastolic BP goal throughout the 24-hour ABPM period (p less than 0.01).
 The two treatments were equally well tolerated.
 CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that labetalol and enalapril are equally effective in lowering supine diastolic BP in the elderly, but labetalol is more effective in lowering ambulatory BP and heart rate throughout the day.

1930,"Management of hemorrhagic complications from preoperative embolization of arteriovenous malformations.
 Endovascular embolization procedures have undergone dramatic evolution and improvement in recent years.
 Despite these advances, controversy remains regarding the optimal role of these procedures in treating cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) and whether their purpose should be as a presurgical adjunct or as primary therapy.
 This controversy risks fragmentation between disciplines in the broader efforts to improve management of cerebrovascular disorders.
 The authors report seven cases of life-threatening hemorrhages that occurred during staged invasive therapy for AVM's which illustrate the value of a unified team approach to optimize patient care.
 Each patient underwent at least one embolization procedure using polyvinyl alcohol particles, followed in two cases by the occlusion of proximal feeding vessels by platinum microcoils and in one case by the attempted detachment of an endovascular balloon.
 In three patients, catheter penetration into the subarachnoid space resulted in subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 One patient suffered rupture of a large feeding vessel during balloon inflation.
 The final three patients sustained intracranial hemorrhage 2 hours, 8 hours, and 5 days, respectively, following embolization.
 All but two patients underwent emergency craniotomy at the time of the complication.
 These cases underscore the advantages of interdisciplinary management optimizing decision-making and providing expeditious care when life-threatening complications develop.

 Abnormality in the beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene underlying the clinical phenotype of a Lebanese patient with a juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease has been studied.
 Clinical features were progressive spasticity, ataxia, and cognitive decline.
 The protein coding sequence of several beta-hexosaminidase alpha-chain complementary DNAs isolated by polymerase chain reaction was completely normal except for a G-to-A transition at nucleotide position 1511 within exon 13, which resulted in substitution of the normal arginine 504 (CGC) with histidine (CAC).
 Although the patient was from a first-cousin marriage, she was heterozygous for this mutation.
 The abnormality in the other allele, which is carried by the father, was not identified, except that it is neither of the two mutations responsible for the infantile Jewish Tay-Sachs disease.
 Biosynthetic and immunoprecipitation studies in cultured fibroblasts showed synthesis of the alpha-chain precursor, but the mature form of the alpha-subunit was not detected.

 To determine the surgical indications for aortic arch hypoplasia, the distal arch outer diameter, distal arch index (ratio of the distal arch diameter to the normal aortic ring diameter), and postoperative pressure gradient across the aortic arch were studied in 23 patients under 6 months of age who underwent surgery for coarctation and/or aortic arch hypoplasia.
 The ratio of the pressure gradient across the arch to the right radial artery was used to evaluate the postoperative level of stenosis.
 The maximum ratio of the pressure gradient that could be tolerated after surgery was considered to be 0.15 from the operative results.
 Negative correlations were found between the distal arch outer diameter and postoperative pressure gradient ratio (r = 0.80), and the distal arch index and postoperative pressure gradient ratio (r = 0.80).
 These correlations proved that in order to obtain a postoperative pressure gradient ratio of 0.15 or less, a distal arch outer diameter of 3.9 mm or more and a distal arch index of 0.63 or more were necessary.
 Consequently, a distal arch outer diameter of 3.9 mm or a distal arch index of 0.63 is considered to indicate that aortic arch hypoplasia is in need of repair.

 Percutaneous transvenous mitral valvuloplasty (PTMV) was performed with two cylindric pigtail balloon catheters in a 52-year-old woman with symptomatic mitral stenosis.
 The subvalvular apparatus was fibrous with welded chordae and the subvalvular left ventricular space was markedly reduced.
 As a result of this distorted anatomy, during the inflations, the two balloons constantly slipped back into the left atrium before full inflation was obtained.
 After the procedure, the mitral valve area (MVA), as estimated by echo-doppler (ED), increased from 1.00 to 1.34 cm2.
 After 2 months of mild clinical improvement, the patient again became symptomatic and ED examination showed a MVA of 1.25 cm2.
 A second PTMV was performed with an Inoue balloon, the entire procedure taking less than 1 hour.

 A total of 68 foxes from farms with a history of death caused by dilated cardiomyopathy and 14 foxes from a farm with no history of dilated cardiomyopathy were studied.
 Dilated cardiomyopathy was diagnosed by echocardiography in 48% of the foxes from one farm with a positive history and in none of the foxes from the control farm.
 Foxes less than 9 months of age were more commonly affected than older foxes (p = 0.03).
 Plasma taurine concentrations were significantly less (p less than 0.01) in foxes that had dilated cardiomyopathy (26.8 +/- 16.4 nmol/ml) than in the control foxes (99.3 +/- 60.2 nmol/ml).

 Percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty has been accompanied by significant early periprocedural morbidity and mortality.
 Identification of factors associated with increased mortality might allow for improved selection of patients.
 The Mansfield Scientific Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry was analyzed to identify the frequency of in-hospital death and the factors associated with it.
 Of 492 patients undergoing the procedure, 37 (7.5%) died during the hospital stay in which valvuloplasty was performed.
 Twenty-four of these patients died within the first 24 h and the remainder died within 7 days after the procedure.
 There were significant differences in baseline clinical and hemodynamic characteristics as well as procedural and postprocedural variables between patients dying and those surviving the in-hospital period.
 Multivariate analysis identified four factors associated with increased mortality: 1) the occurrence of a procedure-related complication, 2) a lower initial left ventricular systolic pressure, 3) a smaller final aortic valve area, and 4) a lower baseline cardiac output.
 Thus, baseline hemodynamic, procedural and postprocedural variables and complications can be identified that are associated with increased mortality.

 Chromosome analysis showed deletion of band 17p13 in 14 of 25 MDS probands.
 RFLP and somatic cell hybrid studies using probes from the 17p13.3 region including pYNZ22 (D17S5), pYNH37 (D17S28), and p144-D6 (D17S34) detected deletions in 19 of 25 probands tested including seven in whom chromosome analysis was normal.

 Overall crude incidence rates were 6.0 and 6.6 per 100,000 males and females, respectively.
 Evaluation of trends in 9-year periods showed that the rates increased from 3.2 to 8.9 for males (P = 0.015) and from 4.4 to 11.7 for females (P less than 0.001).
 Age-specific rates suggested that the highest incidence occurs in the age-groups 50 to 59 years and 70 years or older for males and 40 to 49 years and 70 years or older for females.
 Lesions were most common in the head and neck area among males (P = 0.044) and on the lower extremities among females (P = 0.018).
 The most frequent histologic type was superficial spreading melanoma (61%).
 Five-year survival was diminished overall for patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma--0.72 in comparison with 0.88 expected for the general population.

 Fifty consecutive patients with acute venous thromboembolism had their continuous intravenous heparin therapy adjusted according to this heparin nomogram.
 The effect of the nomogram on heparin therapy in these patients was compared with data from 53 historical control patients.
 The proportion of patients in the nomogram group who reached a therapeutic APTT at 24 hours after the start of heparin therapy was 66%, which increased to 81% at 48 hours.
 In contrast, 37% and 58% of the control patients reached a therapeutic APTT at 24 and 48 hours, respectively.
 The percentage of therapeutic APTT results of the total number of APTT determinations was greater in the nomogram patients than controls.
 The use of this heparin nomogram resulted in (1) achieving a therapeutic APTT at 24 and 48 hours in a large proportion of patients and (2) reduced periods of inadequate anticoagulation and overanticoagulation during heparin therapy.

1945,"Induction of different morphologic features of malignant melanoma and pigmented lesions after transformation of murine melanocytes with bFGF-cDNA and H-ras, myc, neu, and E1a oncogenes.
 Malignant melanomas show a remarkable degree of heterogeneity because of different morphologic features, biologic behavior, and prognosis.
 In this communication, the authors attempted to correlate morphologic heterogeneity of melanomas with transformation by different activated oncogenes; they studied the histologic features of melanocytic lesions induced by murine melanocytes transformed by basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF-cDNA) or H-ras, neu, myc, and E1a oncogenes, and the lesions were compared with those observed in human pathology.
 Tumors formed after grafting onto syngenic mice or subcutaneous injections in nude mice were studied.
 In syngenic mice, benign melanocytic lesions reminiscent of intradermal nevus were observed with melanocytes transformed with b-FGF-cDNA, and myc and E1a oncogenes.
 Benign lesions were also formed by neu-transformed melanocytes when they were grafted concomitantly with keratinocytes, whereas malignant tumors were formed by the same cells when grafted alone or together with fibroblasts.
 In contrast, H-ras melanocytes always formed malignant tumors.
 In nude mice, b-FGF-transformed melanocytes induced benign lesions, whereas transformed melanocytes by the other oncogenes formed malignant tumors with distinctive and homogeneous morphologic features that depended on the transforming oncogene.
 Melanomas with either epithelioid cell, spindle cell, small round cell, and anaplastic cell growth patterns could be distinguished after transformation with H-ras, neu, E1a, and myc oncogenes, respectively.
 These various histologic types are analogous to those that may be observed in human melanomas, even within the same tumor.
 These studies suggest a possible molecular mechanism for tumor heterogeneity in which distinct oncogenes or oncogenelike activities can be activated in different tumors or discrete parts of the same tumor.

1946,"Patients in a persistent vegetative state attitudes and reactions of family members.
 Patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) constituted approximately 3% of the population in four Milwaukee nursing homes.
 In order to understand family members' attitudes and reactions toward such patients, 33 (92%) of 36 family members of patients in PVS contacted were studied.
 The age of the patients ranged from 19 to 95 with a mean age of 73.4 +/- 17.2 years, and family members' ages ranged from 41 to 89 with a mean age of 61.8 +/- 3.3 years.
 The etiology of the PVS varied from dementia to cerebral trauma.
 The mean duration of the PVS was 54 +/- 8.4 months (range 12 to 204).
 Family members reported that they visited patients 260 times during the first year following the onset of the PVS and were still visiting at a rate of 209 visits yearly at the time of the interview.
 There was no significant correlation between the frequency of the family members visits and the duration of the PVS, the patient's or family member's age, or the family member's relationship to the patient.
 Ninety percent of patients were considered by family members to have some awareness of pain, light or darkness, environment, taste, verbal conversation, or the family member's presence.
 Most family members thought they understood the patient's medical condition, and the majority did not expect the patient to improve.
 Nevertheless, the majority of family members wanted the patient to undergo therapeutic interventions, including transfer to the acute hospital and surgery.

1947,"The validity of canine platelet aggregometry in predicting vascular graft patency.
 Several laboratories have found canine platelet aggregometry predictive of thrombotic potential in vascular grafts.
 Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is a frequently used agonist, often at unspecified or differing concentrations.
 This study was designed to evaluate the predictive value of ADP-induced platelet aggregometry and the validity of the methodology.
 Platelet aggregometry in response to 2 x 10(-5) M ADP was assayed in 70 dogs.
 Twenty-six percent were aggregators, 51% were non-aggregators, and 20% were indeterminant.
 All dogs were then treated with aspirin and dipyridamole.
 Vascular prostheses were implanted bilaterally (aorto-iliac) and anti-platelet therapy continued for two weeks.
 Dose-response to ADP was studied at three concentrations in 20 dogs.
 At 2 x 10(-5) 1/20 aggregated, at 4 x 10(-5) 3/19 aggregated and at 2 x 10(-4) 15/20 aggregated.
 Time between samples and study was evaluated in 11 dogs, with 2/11 changing from non-aggregator to aggregator at two or three hours.
 Daily reproducibility was studied in 70 dogs, 14 of which changed aggregation status between days.
 Patency was 58/68 (85%) for non-aggregators, 23/34 (68%) for aggregators (p = 0.038).
 Platelet aggregometry has significant predictive value for graft patency but methodology must be specified and standardized.

 Data obtained from the New Jersey State Department of Health on the 1985 hospitalized patients with burns and data collected from the National Burn Victim Foundation's standard burn reporting form were analyzed to gather information about the epidemiology of burns.
 Children (0 to 4 years of age) continue to be the largest percentage of the 0- to 18-year-old age group who sustain burn injuries, and 67% of those injuries are sustained by children under the age of 5.
 Males accounted for 69% of the total burn population; 58% of admissions were white; 69% of patients were admitted for partial-thickness burns, and 31% were admitted for full-thickness burns; the largest primary payer was third-party payers; and 92% of patients with burns were discharged to home or self-care.
 Data were also analyzed by examination of selected age groups to determine individual needs of specific groups.
 An analysis of burn injuries reported to the National Burn Victim Foundation confirmed previous reports that the home is the most likely place for a burn injury to occur and that flame and scald injuries predominate; scald injuries comprise 50% of all sustained burns.
 Gasoline vapors accounted for 54% of burn injuries caused by flames.
 The data supported efforts to develop programs that address the needs of the urban child, the 17- to 19-year-old age groups, and the elderly.
 The information that was collected served to redefine objectives for burn prevention programs.

1950,"Treatment of relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin before marrow transplantation.
 Combination chemotherapy is capable of curing many patients with newly diagnosed intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but treatment of relapsed NHL remains problematic.
 Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) offers the best chance for disease-free survival, but interim chemotherapy is often necessary while awaiting BMT, especially for patients with bulky disease.
 We report here 39 patients (median age, 44 years) who failed primary therapy with doxorubicin-based regimens and subsequently were treated with one to six cycles of dexamethasone, 40 mg intravenous (IV) every day on days 1 to 4, cisplatin 100 mg/m2 by continuous infusion on day 1, and cytarabine 2 g/m2 IV every 12 hours x two doses on day 2 (DHAP) before the planned BMT.
 Histologies included 16 diffuse large-cell, six diffuse mixed, five diffuse small-cleaved, four lymphoblastic, and eight other.
 Twenty-eight patients had stage IV disease, 13 had B symptoms, and 20 had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
 Patients had been treated with a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens.
 Sixty-one percent of patients had high tumor burdens according to the MD Anderson criteria.
 Objective responses to DHAP were seen in 26 patients (67%) including nine complete responses (CRs) (23%) and 17 partial responses (PRs) (44%), and responses lasted a median of 7.5 months.
 Myelosuppression was the major toxicity, but there were no treatment-related deaths.
 To date, 17 patients have undergone subsequent BMT with a projected 3-year disease-free survival of 15%.
 We conclude that the DHAP regimen is effective short-term salvage therapy for relapsed NHL patients, but the long-term prognosis of multiply relapsed patients remains poor.

1951,"Rising incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia 
 Analyses of cancer incidence data from nine areas of the United States revealed steadily rising rates from 1976 to 1987 of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia.
 The increases among men in this period ranged from 4% to 10% per year, and thus exceeded those of any other type of cancer.
 In contrast, there were relatively stable trends for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and slight declines for adenocarcinoma of more distal portions of the stomach.
 Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia disproportionately affected white men and rarely occurred among women.
 By the mid-1980s, among white men, adenocarcinomas accounted for about one third of all esophageal cancers, while cardia cancers accounted for about one half of all stomach cancers with specified subsites.
 The rising incidence rates and similar demographic patterns point to the need for investigation into the causes of these poorly understood cancers.

 One hundred four participants in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial (mean age 71 +/- 6 years) were examined by Doppler echocardiography to gain information on the cardiac structural and functional alterations in isolated systolic hypertension.
 Participants had a systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg and were compared with 55 age-matched normotensive control subjects.
 Left ventricular mass index was significantly higher in the participants than in the normotensive subjects (103 +/- 28 versus 87 +/- 23 g/m2, p = 0.0014) and 26% of the participants met echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy compared with 10% of normotensive subjects.
 Left atrial index was also greater in participants than in normotensive subjects (2.26 +/- 0.32 versus 2.11 +/- 0.24 cm/m2, p = 0.005) and 51% of participants had left atrial enlargement.
 Doppler measures of diastolic filling were significantly different between the two groups, with peak atrial velocity higher (76 +/- 17 versus 69 +/- 17 cm/s, p = 0.02) and ratio of peak early to atrial velocity lower (0.76 +/- 0.23 versus 0.86 +/- 0.22, p = 0.0124) in participants.
 There was no correlation between left ventricular mass index and Doppler measures of diastolic function, but relative wall thickness correlated significantly with peak atrial velocity (r = 0.22, p = 0.016) and peak early to peak atrial velocity ratio (r = 0.24, p = 0.007).

1953,"Influences of angiotensin on renal function in renal vascular hypertension.
 The scope and the magnitude of the roles which angiotensin plays in the generation and maintenance of elevated blood pressure in models of renal vascular hypertension are continuing to expand.
 It is now clear that specific angiotensin dependent mechanisms contribute importantly to the pathophysiology of hypertension and altered renal function in models of two-kidney, one clip hypertension in rats.
 The generation of angiotensin in the local intrarenal environment of the kidney is a new and potentially important mechanism contributing to altered renal function in these models.
 Application of antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system to rat models of renal vascular hypertension indicate that the effects of angiotensin attenuate renal hemodynamic and excretory behavior, particularly in the nonclipped kidney.
 Further, angiotensin may attenuate the efficiency of autoregulation of renal hemodynamics in the nonclipped kidney.
 Evidence that inhibition of angiotensin reverses or improves these altered hemodynamic and excretory functions indicate that angiotensin may contribute importantly to the pathophysiology of hypertension in these models by altering or impairing the ability of the nonclipped or normal kidney to excrete sodium and volume.

 To determine the clinical outcome and the long-term results of a second coronary artery bypass operation, we studied preoperative clinical status and catheterization data in 200 consecutive patients over a 9-year period (1979 to 1987) (mean follow up time 34 months, maximum 120).
 The study group included 169 men and 31 women (mean age 58.4 years [7% greater than 70 years]).
 Sixty-four percent of patients had severe angina (New York Heart Association class IV), 70% had 3-vessel coronary artery disease and 21% had poor left ventricular function.
 Reoperation was performed after a mean interval of 58 months after the first procedure.
 A mean of 3.3 distal anastomoses was placed.
 The operative mortality rate (30 days) was 7.5%, with additional cardiac morbidity (myocardial infarction, heart failure) in 11.5% of patients.
 Multivariate analysis showed an increased risk in women (risk ratio 3.6) and in patients with poor left ventricular function (risk ratio 3.1).
 The cumulative 5-year survival rate was estimated at 84%, with a rate of 77% for patients with poor left ventricular function (difference not significant).
 The probability of remaining free of a cardiac-related event (myocardial infarction, angioplasty, third operation, cardiac death) was 64% for 5 years.
 At the end of follow-up, 79% of the surviving patients were in New York Heart Association class I or II and nearly 50% of patients in the fifth year after the reoperation had good functional status.
 It is concluded that a reoperation is effective but carries an increased, immediate, operative risk.

 We designed a model to evaluate the effectiveness of various noninvasive methods of ventilation.
 The upper airway was simulated with the head of a Resusci-Annie which was attached to a test lung.
 The esophagus and stomach were simulated with a Penrose drain connected to a rolling seal spirometer via a PEEP valve.
 Fifteen paramedic volunteers ventilated the model utilizing mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-mask, bag-valve-mask, or portable field ventilator (Impact or HARV).
 Recording of tidal volume, gastric volume, and proximal and distal airway pressure was completed at three different levels of compliance.
 At normal compliance, all methods except the HARV met or exceeded American Heart Association standards.
 As compliance decreased, tidal volume fell and gastric insufflation increased.
 At a compliance of 0.02 L/cm H2O all methods failed to meet AHA standards and gastric insufflation volume equalled delivered tidal volumes for mouth-to-mouth and mouth-to-mask techniques.
 Mouth-to-mouth and mouth-to-mask techniques generated the largest tidal volumes but also created the largest volume of gastric insufflation.
 The Impact ventilator provided an acceptable tidal volume with minimal gastric insufflation.
 Our results suggest that mouth-to-mask ventilation with supplemental oxygen enrichment is the most efficient technique for non-invasive airway management.

 The glucose transporter of the human brain has been localized to endothelial cells expressing the blood-brain barrier, but little is known regarding its mechanism of induction or whether its expression is exclusively linked with restricted vascular permeability.
 We investigated glucose transporter expression by vessels in human astrocytic tumors and pulmonary metastases to the brain using immunohistochemical techniques.
 Vessels in 9 of 10 low-grade astrocytomas and 8 of 10 anaplastic astrocytomas were positive for glucose transporter.
 Glioblastoma vessels were transporter-positive in only 2 of 10 specimens.
 Vessels in all three metastatic tumors were negative for the glucose transporter.
 The decrease in transporter expression observed in higher-grade tumors occurred independently of increases in vascular permeability.
 In low-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas transporter expression and contrast enhancement were inversely related, but vessels in 6 of 9 anaplastic astrocytomas were transporter-positive despite contrast enhancement.
 These findings suggest that separate mechanisms induce the glucose transporter and the permeability restrictions of the human blood-brain barrier.
 They also have potential implications for the therapy and prognosis of astroglial neoplasms.

 Nineteen cases are described, including 12 cases from three different families and 7 nonfamilial cases, in which multisystem neurological disease was associated with acanthocytosis in peripheral blood and normal plasma lipoproteins.
 Mild acanthocytosis can easily be overlooked, and scanning electron microscopy may be helpful.
 Some neurologically asymptomatic relatives with significant acanthocytosis were identified during family screening, including some who were clinically affected.
 The mean age of onset was 32 (range 8-62) yrs and the clinical course was usually progressive but there was marked phenotypic variation.
 Cognitive impairment, psychiatric features and organic personality change occurred in over half the cases, and more than one-third had seizures.
 Orofaciolingual involuntary movements and pseudobulbar disturbance commonly caused dysphagia and dysarthria that was sometimes severe, but biting of the lips or tongue was rarely seen.
 Chorea was seen in almost all symptomatic cases but dystonia, tics, involuntary vocalizations and akinetic-rigid features also occurred.
 Two cases had no movement disorder at all.
 Computerized tomography often demonstrated cerebral atrophy.
 Caudate atrophy was seen less commonly, and nonspecific focal and symmetric signal abnormalities from the caudate or lentiform nuclei were seen by magnetic resonance imaging in 3 out of 4 cases.
 Depression or absence of tendon reflexes was noted in 13 cases and neurophysiological abnormalities often indicated an axonal neuropathy.
 Sural nerve biopsies from 3 cases showed evidence of a chronic axonal neuropathy with prominent regenerative activity, predominantly affecting the large diameter myelinated fibres.
 Serum creatine kinase activity was increased in 11 cases but without clinical evidence of a myopathy.
 Postmortem neuropathological examination in 1 case revealed extensive neuronal loss and gliosis affecting the corpus striatum, pallidum, and the substantia nigra, especially the pars reticulata.
 The cerebral cortex appeared spared and the spinal cord showed no evidence of anterior horn cell loss.
 Two examples of the McLeod phenotype, an X-linked abnormality of expression of Kell blood group antigens, were identified in a single family and included 1 female.
 The genetics of neuroacanthocytosis are unclear and probably heterogeneous, but the available pedigree data and the association with the McLeod phenotype suggest that there may be a locus for this disorder on the short arm of the X chromosome.

 To assess the relation between increases in contractile function and oxygen consumption (VO2) during increased coronary flow (Gregg's phenomenon), we measured the end-systolic pressure-volume relation and the relation between VO2 and left ventricular systolic pressure-volume area (PVA, a measure of total mechanical energy output) in blood-perfused, isovolumically contracting rabbit hearts during control and intracoronary adenosine infusion.
 During adenosine infusion at a constant perfusion pressure (93 +/- 11 mm Hg), coronary flow increased by 99 +/- 76% (p less than 0.01), and the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, Emax (ventricular contractility index), increased by 18 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01).
 When compared at the same left ventricular volume, PVA increased by 20 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01) and VO2 by 19 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) with adenosine.
 The VO2-PVA relation was linear under each condition (both median r = 0.98).
 With increased coronary flow, the VO2-intercept of the VO2-PVA relation (unloaded VO2) increased by 22 +/- 18% (p less than 0.01) without a change in the slope; that is, a parallel upward shift was observed, indicating that the contractile efficiency (energy conversion efficiency of the contractile machinery) remained constant.
 These increases in Emax and unloaded VO2 were not eliminated by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol.
 We conclude that increased coronary flow with adenosine at a constant perfusion pressure augments both Emax and the nonmechanical energetic cost for excitation-contraction coupling and basal metabolism via nonadrenergic mechanisms, without changing contractile efficiency.

 Serum samples were obtained before each cycle of chemotherapy, before surgery, at least 4 weeks after surgery, and at 2- to 3-month intervals during follow-up from 78 of the patients with locally advanced cervical cancer who were receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
 Squamous cell carcinoma antigen serum levels were elevated (greater than 2.5 ng/ml) in 71% of the patients with primary tumors and in 77% of the patients with recurrent carcinomas.

 This study describes factors that contribute to spontaneous termination of reentry lasting one to 10 cycles after induction by a single premature stimulus.
 Reentry was studied in vitro in rings of canine atrial tissue from around the tricuspid valve orifice.
 Activation was recorded from a circular array of 10 extracellular bipolar electrodes equally spaced around the ring.
 In some experiments, transmembrane or monophasic action potential recordings were made near critical sites.
 Termination of reentry within one cycle after induction was recorded 110 times in 11 of 35 experiments.
 Important factors contributing to termination were 1) an obligatory reversal of the activation sequence that resulted in a long coupling interval in the critical region beyond the site of unidirectional block after the premature stimulus and 2) much longer refractory periods limited to this critical region, which facilitated unidirectional block but contributed to termination when this region was first activated with a short coupling interval at the end of the first reentrant cycle.
 Termination of nonsustained reentry lasting longer than one cycle resulted from oscillations of conduction and refractoriness initiated by the abrupt shortening of cycle length after initiation of reentry.
 Oscillations of conduction resulted from interval-dependent conduction of reentrant impulses that encountered partially refractory tissue.
 For reentry to become sustained, the oscillations after induction of reentry must dampen.
 Thus, damped cycle length oscillations after induction may identify clinical tachycardias caused by reentry with a partially excitable gap.

 Hematopoietic depression and subsequent susceptibility to potentially lethal opportunistic infections are well-documented phenomena following radiotherapy.
 Methods to therapeutically mitigate radiation-induced myelosuppression could offer great clinical value.
 In vivo studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulates pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell (CFU-s), granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cell (GM-CFC), and erythroid progenitor cell (CFU-e) proliferation in normal mice.
 Based on these results, the ability of IL-6 to stimulate hematopoietic regeneration following radiation-induced hematopoietic injury was also evaluated.
 C3H/HeN female mice were exposed to 6.5 Gy 60Co radiation and subcutaneously administered either saline or IL-6 (1,000 micrograms/kg) on days 1 through 3 or 1 through 6 postexposure.
 On days 7, 10, 14, 17, and 22, femoral and splenic CFU-s, GM-CFC, and CFU-e contents and peripheral blood white cell, red cell, and platelet counts were determined.
 Compared with saline treatment, both 3-day and 6-day IL-6 treatments accelerated hematopoietic recovery; 6-day treatment produced the greater effects.
 For example, compared with normal control values (N), femoral and splenic CFU-s numbers in IL-6-treated mice 17 days postirradiation were 27% N and 136% N versus 2% N and 10% N in saline-treated mice.
 At the same time, bone marrow and splenic GM-CFC values were 58% N and 473% N versus 6% N and 196% N in saline-treated mice; bone marrow and splenic CFU-e numbers were 91% N and 250% N versus 31% N and 130% N in saline-treated mice; and peripheral blood white cell, red cell, and platelet values were 210% N, 60% N, and 24% N versus 18% N, 39% N, and 7% N in saline-treated mice.

 Methylmalonic aciduria can be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase apoenzyme (mut) or genes required for the provision of cofactor B12 (cbl).
 The mut and cbl forms are classically differentiated by somatic cell complementation.
 We describe a novel method for differential diagnosis of mut and cbl methylmalonic aciduria using DNA-mediated gene transfer of a methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA clone.
 Gene transfer of a functional methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA clone into mut fibroblasts reconstitutes holoenzyme activity measured by metabolism of [14C]-propionate in culture.
 Identical gene transfers into cbl fibroblasts have no effect.
 This method is used for the differential diagnosis of mut and cbl genotypes in cells from patients with a clinical diagnosis of methylmalonic aciduria and is shown to be a facile, sensitive, and specific method for genetic diagnosis.
 This work establishes the principle of using DNA-mediated gene transfer to identify the genotype of diseases which can result from mutations at several different genetic loci.
 This type of differential genotypic diagnosis will be particularly important for establishing the applicability of somatic gene therapy in individual patients.

1970,"Blood flow direction in the lumbar nerve root.
 The effect of clipping on lumbar nerve root blood flow rates in the region of the nerve root canal was studied experimentally in the hog.
 Blood flow rate was measured using the hydrogen washout technique.
 When the entrance zone was clipped with a microvascular clip, blood flow rate of the nerve root was decreased by 37% in comparison with the initial control rate; clipping at the exit zone reduced blood flow rate by 69%.
 Blood flow direction in the lumbar nerve root within the nerve root canal was found to be predominantly proximal.
 The current data indicate that the more lateral the impingement of the nerve root occurs, the more ischemic changes are induced.

1971,"Analysis of interferon-inducible genes in cells of chronic myeloid leukemia patients responsive or resistant to an interferon-alpha treatment.
 Recombinant human interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) can induce a hematologic remission in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.
 However, some patients are resistant and others develop late resistance to the IFN-alpha treatment.
 To understand the molecular mechanism of this resistance, we have analyzed the expression of 10 IFN-inducible genes in the cells of three resistant patients, two responsive patients, and six healthy controls.
 Northern blot hybridizations showed that all the genes were induced in in vitro IFN-alpha treated peripheral blood cells of the patients and healthy controls.
 These genes were also inducible in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of two out of two resistant patients administered an injection of IFN-alpha.
 We conclude that the resistance to the IFN-alpha treatment of the chronic myeloid leukemia patients we studied is not due to (1) the absence of induction of any of the 10 IFN-inducible genes we studied, including the low-molecular-weight 2'-5'oligoadenylate synthetase; (2) the presence of an antagonist of IFN-alpha in the peripheral blood or bone marrow cells; and (3) the presence of neutralizing anti-IFN-alpha antibodies.

 Using an antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), mesencephalic cholinergic cell nuclei were studied in autopsy material from 3 cases of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 4 controls.
 ChAT-immunoreactive neurons were quantified in sections that spanned the rostrocaudal extent of each nucleus.
 In PSP, there was a significant decrease in the number of neurons with detectable immunoreactivity for ChAT in and adjacent to the central gray substance in the following nuclei: the nucleus of Edinger-Westphal (69%); the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (97%); the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (78%).
 A cell loss was also evident in a group of neurons found in the deep layers of the superior colliculus (93%).
 In contrast, the estimated number of ChAT-immunoreactive cell bodies in cranial nerves III and IV, in the mesencephalic reticular formation, and in the parabigeminal nucleus was not different from that of controls.
 The results are compatible with the notion that, in PSP, there is a regionally selective destruction of cholinergic neurons.

 Botulinum toxin A was administered to 19 patients in a double-blind placebo controlled trial.
 Toxin was more effective than placebo for improving both head position and pain which was measured by an objective rating scale and videofilm assessments.
 Following the controlled trial, treatment with botulinum toxin was continued in an open fashion.
 A total of 60 patients with torticollis received toxin in a total of 117 treatment periods.
 The mean follow up period was 8.4 months.
 In 39 patients with pain there was benefit in 77% of treatment periods.
 Some improvement in neck posture occurred in 83% of the treatment periods with a mean duration of 12 weeks.
 Side effects were frequent with dysphagia being the most common (28% of treatment periods).
 Botulinum toxin is an effective treatment for toticollis but treatment should be initiated with doses at the lower end of the range used in this study (400-600 mouse units).

 Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor that typically arises in cells of the developing adrenal medulla.
 IGF-II mRNA is expressed at high levels in the adrenal cortex before birth but it is not detectable until after birth in the adrenal medulla.
 Neuroblastoma cell lines corresponding to early adrenal medullary precursors did not express IGF-II, although all three cell lines we tested were growth stimulated by IGF-II.
 Cell lines corresponding to more mature adrenal medullary cells expressed IGF-II, and one, SK-N-AS, grows by an IGF-II autocrine mechanism (J.

1975,"Cardioprotective effects of authentic nitric oxide in myocardial ischemia with reperfusion.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of nitric oxide (NO), believed to be endothelium-derived relaxing factor on reperfusion injury after myocardial ischemia (MI).
 The effects of NO were investigated in a 6-hr model of MI with reperfusion in open-chest, anesthetized cats.
 A solution containing NO was infused iv starting 30 min after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, continuing through reperfusion 1 hr later, and lasting for 5.5 hr.
 Estimated NO concentration in the circulation was 1 to 2 x 10(-9) M.
 RESULTS: The areas-at-risk expressed as a percentage of the total left ventricular weights were not significantly different among either of the MI groups.
 However, the necrotic area (expressed as a percentage of the myocardial area-at-risk) was significantly (p less than .01) lower in the NO-treated MI cats compared with the MI + vehicle group.
 Cardiac myeloperoxidase activities indicated that significantly (p less than .05) fewer neutrophils were attracted to the necrotic zone of the NO-treated MI cats when compared with MI cats receiving only the vehicle.
 Sodium nitrate (NaNO2) (pH 7.4), a major breakdown product of NO, failed to exert any protective effect in this same model of MI and reperfusion.
 CONCLUSIONS: NO appears to provide significant myocardial protection after ischemia and reperfusion.
 NO may afford cardioprotection by incorporation into circulating blood cells (i.e., neutrophils, platelets), thereby inhibiting their accumulation and adherence in the ischemic region, or by a direct cardiac cytoprotective effect.
 Further studies using NO donors rather than NO would be an appropriate clinically relevant mode of treatment in MI.

 To date, tumour markers for gastric cancer have proved unreliable.
 In this study the value of a new serum marker, CA72-4, was compared with the serum activities of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA19-9 in a consecutive series of patients with gastric cancer.
 The results show that the CA72-4 assay is significantly better at separating stage I and II disease from normal controls (P less than 0.01) than CEA (n.s.) or CA19-9 (n.s.).
 CA72-4 also gave better differentiation between patients with positive and negative nodes (P less than 0.01) and between those who were serosa positive and negative (P less than 0.01).
 CEA differentiated between patients with positive and negative nodes (P less than 0.05) but CA19-9 could not.
 CA19-9 and CEA could not discriminate between patients who were serosa positive and negative.
 In this study, at a specificity of 95 per cent, the sensitivities of CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 were 0.25, 0.41 and 0.94 respectively.
 These preliminary findings indicate that CA72-4 is a reliable tumour marker of disease stage and activity in gastric cancer.

 Recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2) and various effector cell populations were used for adoptive immunotherapy in the Fischer strain 9L rat gliosarcoma model.
 The in vivo cytotoxicities of nonspecifically activated lymphocytes and specifically activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were assessed in a modified in vivo neutralization (Winn) assay.
 Effector cells (10(6)) and 9L tumor cells (10(5] were combined with 10(4) units of rIL-2 and stereotactically implanted into the right frontal centrum semiovale of the Fischer (F344) rat.
 At 7 and 14 days, additional effector cells (10(6] and rIL-2 (10(4) units) were administered through the same burr hole.
 Nonspecifically activated splenocytes were lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, both plastic-adherent and nonadherent, whereas specifically activated CTLs were either syngeneic (genetically identical) or allogeneic (genetically dissimilar).
 Syngeneic CTLs were T lymphocytes from Fischer rats primed in vivo with 9L cells and restimulated in vitro.
 Allogeneic CTLs were generated by exposing DA rat lymphocytes either to irradiated Fischer lymph node cells or to 9L Fisher tumor cells in vitro.
 Control groups included rats bearing 9L tumor who were untreated, those who received peripheral (i.p.
 or s.c.) administration of rIL-2, or those who received syngeneic unstimulated T lymphocytes and rIL-2.
 For a set of animals given the same inoculum of 9L tumor, significantly improved survival was shown for groups treated with nonadherent or adherent LAK cells (P less than or equal to 0.0003), syngeneic CTLs (P = 0.0327), or allogeneic CTLs (P = 0.0025) over untreated control animals by using Mantel-Haenzel nonparametric logrank equations.

 Using death and functional status as end points, we prospectively analyzed the outcome 6 months after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in 166 patients admitted to an acute-care stroke unit on the first day of their stroke.
 Seventy-one patients (43%) died, 69 (42%) had a satisfactory outcome, and 26 (16%) had a poor functional outcome.
 Early (30-day) survival was correlated with morphologic parameters on the initial computed tomogram (hemorrhage size, midline shift, and intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage), while later (6-month) survival was correlated with age.
 Using logistic regression, we found five independent predictors of satisfactory outcome at 6 months: age, hemorrhage size, intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage, limb paresis, and communication disorders.
 Of these, age was the most important predictor by far.

 The status of quality of life research in oncology is assessed, and priorities for future research with regard to conceptual and theoretical developments, focus and content of research, research designs and practical strategies for research implementation, and transferring information to clinical practice and medical policy decision-making are identified.
 There is general agreement that quality of life is a subjective and multidimensional construct, yet comprehensive theoretical models have not been developed and applied fully.
 We recommend that future research be based on conceptual models that explicate the interrelationships among quality of life domains throughout the stages of cancer care.
 These models, and the longitudinal research that follows from them, should attend specifically to cross-class and cross-cultural issues to avoid overgeneralization from theory and research that are based largely on the views of the majority culture.
 We encourage the inclusion of this theory-based quality of life assessment as a standard component of clinical trials.
 Success in this endeavor will require additional standardization of quality of life measures for use across a range of cancer patient populations, including the development of age-specific norms and instruments designed to assess the entire family system.

 For a decade, the authors have experimented with treatment for unresectable adult soft tissue and bony sarcomas.
 Over the last 6 years, they have combined hyperfractionated radiation therapy and intravenous iododeoxyuridine as a radiosensitizer, in regimens designed to minimize toxicity and permit delivery of aggressive radiation therapy.
 Patients with solitary lesions and those with metastasis (38%) were treated in the hope of both potential cure in some and durable palliation in others.
 The most formidable of these cancers have been those that are large or massive, often requiring five or more fields and extensive treatment planning.
 The authors report results from 36 patients with large unresectable sarcomas (tumors ranging from 5 to 35 cm; average 14 cm) treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year, follow-up of 4 or more years (in 50%), or follow-up until death.

 Carboplatin is less toxic than cisplatin; as a single agent, several responses were seen against esophageal tumors.
 To better define the role of carboplatin in esophageal cancer, the authors treated 19 chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus with carboplatin and vinblastine.
 Carboplatin (450 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] on days 1, 29, 57, and every 6 weeks thereafter) was given with vinblastine (5 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and then every 2 weeks).

1985,"Alcohol and secobarbital effects as a function of familial alcoholism: acute psychophysiological effects.
 Previous research has demonstrated response differences following administration of alcohol between adult males with a positive (FHP) versus negative (FHN) family history of alcoholism.
 These response differences are thought to reflect differences in vulnerability to dependence on alcohol.
 Thus, the role of positive family alcoholism history in increasing risk of addiction to a variety of drug classes might be studied by determining whether FHP subjects show different responses to drug classes other than alcohol.
 This was done in the present study by determining dose-effect functions for a variety of physiological (heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature), subjective (analog mood and drug effect, Subjective High Assessment Scale), and psychomotor measures (hand tremor, body sway, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, eye-hand coordination, and numeric recall) in FHP and FHN college-aged males for secobarbital (0, 100, 200 mg by mouth) and ethanol (1 g/kg).
 FHP and FHN subjects were matched on light-to-moderate drinking patterns, anthropometric dimensions, age, years of schooling, and drug use.
 At equivalent blood alcohol levels family-history positive subjects reported greater effects of ethanol than did family-history negative subjects on almost all subjective measures.
 Following the high dose of secobarbital, FHP but not FHN subjects showed elevated subjective effects; these effects were substantially less and were evident in fewer measures than following ethanol.
 In contrast to effects on the subjective measures, ethanol and secobarbital produced comparable impairment in both groups of subjects for most psychomotor responses.

 Epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence links excessive salt consumption to hypertension; there appears to be no evidence that it is beneficial.
 I conclude that it should be public policy to advise and help Americans to reduce their salt intake.
 Because even mild hypertension increases risk, the overall problem does not appear to be amenable to treatment, although treatment for those with clinical hypertension will always be needed.
 There appears to be little likelihood that identification of those ""at risk"" will be successful, nor does it appear that we have the capacity at this time to conduct successful preventive field trials.
 It is difficult for the individual to modify his diet alone.
 The successful strategy is to modify the food supply by changing public demand.
 The public responds to dietary advice if acceptable and identifiable products are available.
 Because most of the salt is in commercially prepared foods and because their consumption will increase in the future, the major responsibility for lowering salt consumption will fall on the food manufacturers.
 They are beginning to respond, and there appears to be ample opportunity for them to reduce the salt content of foods markedly.
 Our temporary objectives, however, should be modest, because unrealistic objectives only discourage those who attempt to follow them.

 The importance of the interval between methotrexate (MTX) and fluorouracil (5-FU) was studied in 168 patients with previously untreated, measurable, advanced colorectal cancer.
 They were randomized to receive MTX 200 mg/m2, followed by 5-FU 600 mg/m2 either 24 hours (arm A) or 1 hour (arm B) after MTX.
 All patients received leucovorin (LV) 24 hours after MTX, 10 mg/m2 orally every 6 hours for six doses.
 The regimen was repeated every 2 weeks, with 5-FU escalation as tolerated.
 Arm A was significantly better than arm B with respect to overall response rate (29% v 14.5%, P = .026), time to progression (TTP; median, 9.9 months v 5.9 months, P = .009), and survival (median, 15.3 months v 11.4 months, P = .003).
 Significant differences between arms were not found in response rate, median TTP, or median survival for the subgroup of patients with rectal primaries who comprised 20% of the patients in each arm.
 Significant factors prognostic for survival were performance status and number of metastases, as well as treatment.
 Age did not influence survival.
 Toxicity was similar in both arms and was primarily gastrointestinal.
 More mucositis was seen in arm A.
 There were four toxic deaths secondary to neutropenia and infection (one from arm A and three from arm B) and three other deaths (two from arm A and one from arm B) that were possibly drug-related.

 GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which regulates the activities of Ras proteins, is implicated in mitogenic signal transduction by growth-factor receptors and oncoproteins with tyrosine kinase activity.
 Oncogenic viral Src (p60v-src) encoded in Rous sarcoma virus possesses elevated tyrosine kinase activity compared with its nononcogenic normal homolog, cellular Src (p60c-src).
 To examine molecular interactions between GAP and the two Src kinases, immunoprecipitates of Src or GAP prepared from cell lystates were resolved by gel electrophoresis and analyzed by an immunoblot procedure with antibodies to GAP or Src used as probes.
 Results suggest that p60c-src is associated with a complex containing GAP in immunoprecipitates from lysates of normal rat and chicken cells.
 However, GAP is not phosphorylated in p60c-src immunoprecipitates subjected to in vitro kinase reactions.
 By contrast, GAP undergoes tyrosyl phosphorylation in vitro when immunoprecipitates of p60v-src prepared from transformed cell lysates are incubated with ATP.
 Our findings suggest that p60v-src and p60c-src associate with complexes containing GAP and provide a biochemical link between both kinases and GAP/Ras signal transduction pathways.
 These results are consistent with the hypothesis that GAP has a role in mediating normal functions of p60c-src as well as oncogenic activities of p60v-src.

 In the remaining eight patients, the abnormal response resolved before decompression in two, resolved immediately at the time of decompression in five, and failed to resolve in one.
 All patients were relieved of their hemifacial spasm.
 In the five patients whose abnormalities resolved at the time of decompression, there was a precise intraoperative correlation between decompression of the nerve and disappearance of the abnormal EMG response.

 Keeping the bodies at +6 degrees C, the increase of the hypoxanthine levels was estimated to 3.5 mumol/L per hour when sampling was started more than 12 hours after death (range 2.8 to 5.6 mumol/L per hour).
 Results of hypoxanthine measurements from vitreous humor in 73 infants with sudden infant death syndrome, 17 infants and children who died sudden violent deaths, and 6 neonates who died suddenly without hypoxemia prior to death were corrected according to the expected postmortem hypoxanthine increase.
 The time between death and autopsy was similar in the three groups studied.
 The corrected median hypoxanthine level in the group with sudden infant death syndrome was 227 mumol/L, which is significantly higher than in the other groups; 22 mumol/L in the group who had violent deaths (P less than .01), and 0 mumol/L in the neonate group (P less than .01).

 Eighteen patients were men and 10 were women.
 Twenty-three patients had unilateral disease.
 Four patients were diagnosed only at autopsy, leaving 24 for analysis of treatment and survival.
 Twenty-one patients had received specific active immunotherapy, four had received chemotherapy (dacarbazine, lomustin, bleomycin, and vincristine), and three had received both before the diagnosis of their adrenal disease.
 Adrenal metastases were diagnosed by CT scanning in 14 patients with symptoms, 10 (91%) of whom had pain.
 Ten patients were diagnosed by CT before entry into a chemotherapy protocol.
 Of eight patients who underwent resection of all known disease, five underwent unilateral adrenalectomy, two underwent unilateral adrenalectomy and bowel resection, and one underwent bilateral adrenalectomy.
 Two patients underwent partial resection of large unilateral tumors.
 Fourteen patients with adrenal metastases and disease elsewhere were initiated or continued with chemotherapy or were treated symptomatically.
 Mean survival in the group that underwent resection for cure was 59 months (3 to 112 months), whereas survival in the group with unresectable tumors was 15 months (1.5 to 132 months).
 Four of eight patients who underwent resection for cure lived more than 5 years after detection of adrenal metastasis, whereas in only one of 14 patients with unresectable tumors was the same true.

 In the first mutant, all but 16 amino acid residues of the intracellular domain of the receptor were removed.
 This receptor bound NGF with a Kd comparable to that of the wild-type receptor.
 A second mutant contained only the four cysteine-rich sequences from the extracellular portion of the protein.
 This mutant was expressed in COS cells and the resultant protein was a secreted soluble form of the receptor that was able to bind NGF.
 Two N-terminal deletions, in which either the first cysteine-rich sequence of the first and part of the second cysteine-rich sequences were removed, bound NGF.

 In this review, the current status of the diagnosis and management of the various types of thyroid cancer are carefully reviewed and extensively documented.

1998,"Hairless micropig skin. A novel model for studies of cutaneous biology.
 Reported here is the structural and immunohistochemical similarities between the Yucatan hairless micropig (HMP) skin and that of humans.
 Hairless micropig skin surface was composed of complex intersecting furrows that created geometric patterns remarkably similar to human skin surface glyphics.
 The dermal--epidermal interface consisted of undulant downgrowths that interdigitated with dermal papillae.
 Hairless micropig epidermis contained two morphologically distinct populations of basal keratinocytes (serrated and nonserrated).
 Similar heterogeneity has been seen only in human epidermis and primate palmar epidermis.
 Immunohistochemistry revealed that the HMP epidermis is reactive with monoclonal and polyclonal antisera to keratin proteins.
 Melanocytes reactive with antisera to S-100 protein, as in human skin, also were observed in HMP epidermis.
 Organization of dermal extracellular matrix, including collagen and elastic fibers, and the organization and reactivity of the microvasculature with antisera to factor VIII, were consistent with human skin.
 The costicosteroid-induced atrophy and subsequent rebound phenomenon after withdrawal of steroid observed in HMP skin was similar with that observed in humans.
 It is concluded that HMP skin approximates human skin significantly more precisely than most existing species and is an excellent model for studies of cutaneous physiology and pharmacology.

1999,"Effects of hepatitis B virus, alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking and familial tendency on hepatocellular carcinoma.
 Independent and interactive effects related to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma were assessed using a community-based case-control study for hepatitis B virus, habitual alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, peanut consumption and history of hepatocellular carcinoma among the immediate family.
 All 200 male newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma patients were recruited consecutively through the period of study as the case group from two teaching medical centers in northern and southern Taiwan.
 Healthy community residents matched one-to-one with cases on age, sex, ethnic group and residential area were selected as the control group.
 The carrier status of HBsAg and HBeAg was determined by blind radioimmunoassays, and other risk factors were obtained through standardized interviews according to a structured questionnaire.
 Conditional logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between hepatocellular carcinoma and the carrier status of HBsAg and HBeAg with an odds ratio of 16.7 and 56.5, respectively, for carriers of HBsAg alone and for carriers of both HBsAg and HBeAg.
 There was a dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and hepatocellular carcinoma with an odds ratio of 1.1, 1.5 and 2.6, respectively, for those who smoked 1 to 10, 11 to 20 and more than 20 cigarettes a day.
 A significant association with hepatocellular carcinoma was also observed for the habitual alcohol consumer with an odds ratio of 3.4.
 Those whose immediate family had a history of hepatocellular carcinoma were more likely to have the disease develop, with an odds ratio of 4.6.
 However, the frequency of peanut consumption was not significantly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.

2001,"Carcinoma of the breast: measurement and the management of treatment. I. The value of the data.
 This is the first of a series of papers in which we shall explore some insights into the biological changes which accompany the treatment of human tumours which may be obtained through estimation of volume changes in relation to treatment.
 We have adopted a working hypothesis that regression slopes reflect the composition of individual tumours and, indirectly, their intrinsic growth rate rather than the effectiveness of treatment.
 The breast has proved to be a suitable site for measurement and our interpretation of the results has led to the development of a new style of management for carcinoma of the breast: measurement based sequential therapy (MBST).
 In this paper the method of measurement and detailed statistical evaluation of the quality of the data from 262 patients (263 tumours) is presented.
 Exponential regression lines have been fitted to describe volume changes in relation to treatment by radiation, chemotherapy and hormones.
 A simple classification of steepness of slopes is introduced.

2002,"Cultured human atherosclerotic plaque smooth muscle cells retain transforming potential and display enhanced expression of the myc protooncogene.
 The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) is critical to atherosclerotic plaque formation.
 The monoclonal hypothesis proposes that the stimulus for this SMC proliferation is a mutational event.
 Here we describe a procedure for growing human plaque smooth muscle cells (p-SMC) in culture.
 We show that p-SMCs derived from two patients differ from SMC cultured from normal vascular tissue in expression of the protooncogene myc.
 One p-SMC strain was extensively characterized; these diploid, karyotypically normal cells have a finite life span in culture.
 Ultrastructural examination revealed two populations, one with classic contractile SMC appearance, the other, modulated to a synthetic state.
 Northern blotting showed a 2- to 6-fold and a 6- to 11-fold enhanced expression of myc by p-SMC, compared to SMC derived from healthy human aorta (HA-SMC) and saphenous vein (HV-SMC), respectively.
 In contrast, the p-SMC and HV-SMC expressed similar levels of message for the genes N-myc, L-myc, Ha-ras, fos, sis, myb, LDL receptor, EGF receptor, IGF I receptor, IGF II, and HMG CoA reductase.
 Finally, although p-SMCs are not tumorigenic, DNA isolated from these cells is positive in the transfection-nude mouse tumor assay.
 Myc, however, does not appear to be the transforming gene because no newly introduced human myc gene was detected in the p-SMC-associated nude mouse tumor.
 Thus human atherosclerotic p-SMCs possess both an activated myc gene and a transforming gene that is retained throughout many cell passages.

2003,"A trilaminar skin coverage technique for treatment of severe degloving injuries of the extremities and torso.
 A 60 percent degloving injury involving the torso and lower extremities of an 8-year-old boy is described.
 Successful management employed the use of a new trilaminar skin coverage technique.
 With the avulsed flap still attached to its bed, a 0.14-inch split-thickness graft of epithelium and superficial dermis is raised with a power-driven dermatome.
 From the same harvest site, one level deeper, a second layer consisting of split-thickness dermis (0.14 inch) is taken.
 Both the first and second layers are meshed and expanded.
 The remaining degloved flap is excised and, on a sterile bench, defatted to produce a third layer of deep dermis.
 In our case, this third layer was ultimately lost, but it functioned well as a temporary biologic dressing.
 Depending on donor-site morbidity, other potential applications of this method (i.e., major burn injuries) may be feasible.

2005,"cAMP mediates IL-1-induced lymphocyte penetration through endothelial monolayers.
 Endothelial cell incubated with IL-1 have been shown adhere more lymphocytes than nontreated endothelial cells.
 Here we demonstrate that IL-1 can also increase lymphocyte penetration through endothelial monolayers in vitro.
 IL-1 induced a transient increase in the number of lymphocytes penetrated through the endothelial monolayer into a filter in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
 This effect could be mimicked by increasing the cytosolic cAMP levels in the endothelial cells either by forskolin or dibutyryl-cAMP.
 Concomitantly we were able to show that IL-1 increased the cytosolic cAMP levels in endothelial cells.
 An inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, ddAdo, decreased both the IL-1-induced cAMP elevation and lymphocyte penetration.
 A protein kinase A inhibitor HA 1004 could inhibit the IL-1-induced lymphocyte penetration, where as protein kinase C (N-(2-guamidino-ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesyl foamide hydrocloride) and calcium-calmodulin (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalensulfanamide) inhibitors had no effect.
 Adding dibutyryl-cGMP or calcium ionophore to the endothelial cells could not mimic IL-1-induced penetration and finally IL-1 did not induce PKC translocation in endothelial cells.
 These data support the view that IL-1 acts via cAMP as a second messenger in regard to lymphocyte penetration through endothelial cells.
 The above data demonstrate that IL-1-induced lymphocyte penetration through endothelial cells and that this IL-1-induced signal is transduced via cAMP in endothelial cells.

2006,"The occupational risk of cytomegalovirus infection among day-care providers.
 We prospectively studied day-care providers at six day-care centers in south-eastern Iowa to determine their occupational risk for primary cytomegalovirus infection and to define epidemiologic risk factors.
 Ninety-six (38%) of 252 day-care providers were seropositive for cytomegalovirus by latex agglutination at entry into the study.
 Among 82 seronegative providers available for follow-up, seven seroconversions occurred at only two of the six participating centers, yielding an annualized seroconversion rate of 7.9%.
 Median time to seroconversion among these providers was 13 months.
 Using Kaplan-Meier estimates of risk, we determined that the overall risk of seroconversion among providers at various centers ranged from 0% to 22% by 12 months and from 0% to 40% by 16 months.
 Risk of cytomegalovirus acquisition by providers was independent of race, age, education, the presence of a child at home, or caring for children younger than 2 or 3 years in the day-care center.
 However, the risk of seroconversion among day-care providers appeared to parallel rates of cytomegalovirus excretion and acquisition among children at each center.

2011,"Increased expression of the laminin receptor in human colon cancer.
 It has been proposed that among the various cell-surface proteins capable of interacting with laminin, the 67-kd high-affinity laminin receptor plays a crucial role during tumor invasion and metastasis.
 In this study, the expression of laminin-receptor-precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) and 67-kd protein was analyzed in human colon adenocarcinoma.
 In 22 of 23 patients with colon cancer, we found a 2- to 23-fold increase in levels of laminin-receptor-precursor mRNA in the cancer tissues compared with those in matched normal adjacent colonic mucosa.
 In 10 of 11 cases studied, the level of 67-kd laminin receptor, detected by affinity-purified anti-laminin-receptor synthetic peptide antibodies on immunoblots of matched tumor and normal tissue extracts, was higher in the colon carcinoma tissue.
 Immunodetection of laminin receptor in tissue sections using anti-laminin-receptor-peptide antibodies confirmed that the increased expression of laminin receptor was specifically associated with the cancer cells.
 In a series of 72 paraffin sections of colon lesions, we observed a correlation between the expression of the laminin receptor and the Dukes' classification.
 Our observations indicate that increased expression of laminin-receptor-precursor mRNA is associated with enhanced levels of the 67-kd laminin receptor as well as with the invasive phenotype of colon carcinoma.
 Detection of this metastasis-associated gene product may be a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of human colon cancer.

 The pain occurred from 2 to 84 months after a median sternotomy.
 The pain was described either as sharp and stabbing or as a deep-seated ache.
 The involved wires had an exaggerated fibrous tissue reaction surrounding the twisted portion.
 The adjacent noninvolved wires had minimal reaction.
 In the last 7 patients, serial sections of the fibrous tissue revealed entrapment of one or more sensory nerve fibers.
 In 6 of the 7 electrical potentials were measured and found to be elevated, indicating wire damage during twisting.
 Ferroxyl tests confirmed the collection of iron ions at this anodic point as a result of corrosion.
 Removal of the involved wires and the fibrous tissue surrounding this anodic point relieved the symptoms of pain and tenderness resulting from entrapped sensory nerves.

 The three-dimensional organization of the human cauda equina has not been described previously.
 This is partly due to the difficulties of dissecting individual, unfixed nerve roots.
 By the use of a newly developed in situ fixation and embedding technique on 15 fresh human cadavers, the cross-sectional anatomy of the cauda equina was defined from L2-L3 to L5-S1.
 A highly consistent cross-sectional pattern was observed in all specimens.
 The lower sacral (S2-S5) and coccygeal roots were located in the dorsal aspect of the thecal sac, whereas the lumbar and first sacral roots exhibited an oblique, layered pattern as they ascended.
 The motor bundle was situated anteromedial to its respective sensory bundle within each layer, Invaginations of arachnoid held the nerve roots in a fixed relationship to one another.
 This previously undescribed three-dimensional anatomy within the thecal sac may aid in the understanding and treatment of trauma, neurocompressive syndromes, and tumors of the cauda equina.

 This report examines the relationship of plasma drug concentration to analgesic effect following bolus doses of alfentanil, fentanyl and morphine and assesses individual differences in analgesic response among volunteers.
 We predicted that the 3 opioids would yield disparate analgesic profiles because their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics differ.
 Ten healthy volunteers received intravenous bolus doses of either alfentanil, fentanyl, morphine or normal saline on different days.
 We stimulated their teeth electrically and measured brain evoked potential (EP) and pain report (PR) repeatedly over 2 h to assess analgesic effect.
 Concurrently, we drew 18 blood samples to assess opioid plasma concentrations during the test period.
 The relationship between opioid plasma concentration and analgesic effect was well defined for alfentanil but ambiguous for morphine.
 Fentanyl exhibited a marked hysteresis.
 We observed noteworthy individual differences in analgesic response with all 3 drugs but these differences were greatest for morphine and least for alfentanil.
 Inter- and intrasubject variability in analgesic response across drugs is related to the physicochemical properties of the drugs tested.

 We used the hypothesis of mortality compression as a framework to examine patterns of mortality from 1962 to 1984.
 Data from national vital statistics records were used for analysis of the changing age at death for percentiles of the population.
 Data from the Social Security Administration and the U.S.
 Census Bureau were used to calculate the force of mortality.
 The mean age at death for all percentiles, including the oldest groups, has risen during the interval.
 Examination of the coefficient of variation for the mean age at death suggests that there is a relative increase in the variability of age at death among the oldest old.
 The available data do not fit a hypothetical sequence of normal density distributions with an increasing mean and declining standard deviation.
 The force of mortality in those over 85 years appears to be decreasing in a pattern similar to that for those under 85 years.
 Current mortality patterns suggest an ""expansion,"" rather than compression, of mortality at the oldest ages.
 Further refinement of these observations, with improved data on mortality among the oldest old, will be helpful in delineating mortality patterns.

 The local injection of pure inflammatory mediators induces venular leakage.
 To test the effect of endogenous mediators from dying tissue on vascular leakage, the authors devised an experimental model simulating an infarct, whereby living vessels would be exposed to fragments of organs undergoing aseptic necrosis.
 Tissues from donor rats were implanted aseptically in the cremasteric sac.
 Control rats were implanted with materials deemed to be as close as possible to nonirritating: boiled tissues and spheres of Teflon or glass.
 At different points the rats were injected intravenously with carbon black and killed an hour later.
 Whole cremaster mounts showed that vascular labeling was strictly venular up to 8 hours, mixed with capillary labeling between 12 and 24 hours, and mainly or exclusively capillary at 48 hours.
 Histology showed an acute inflammatory infiltrate in the labeled areas.
 A similar but weaker labeling pattern accompanied by milder inflammation was seen in controls.
 These results indicate that the vascular leakage in aseptic inflammation is biphasic, first venular, then capillary; and that the capillary phase is induced by the inflammatory reaction itself, possibly through a form of diffuse angiogenesis.

 Etoposide, despite extensive use in other malignancies, has played a minor role in the treatment of patients with breast cancer.
 Single-agent trials in which etoposide is administered to heavily pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer have demonstrated a low overall response rate (6.6% of 383 patients), with no convincing evidence for either schedule dependence or a relationship between dose intensity and response.
 The sole single-agent trial in previously untreated patients suggested that the drug has an approximately 15% response rate in untreated patients.
 Combination therapy trials in which etoposide has been combined with either cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, or cisplatin have not yet convincingly demonstrated superiority over any of these drugs as single agents, although cisplatin plus etoposide appears to be superior to either agent alone.
 In vitro studies suggest that pretreating hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells with estradiol may increase their sensitivity to etoposide-induced DNA cleavage.
 This may represent a future direction in the use of etoposide in breast cancer.
 Currently, however, the use of etoposide in breast cancer should be considered investigational.

 Sinusoidal endothelial cells of HCC characteristically showed a diffuse and strong immunoreactivity to ABH blood group antigens in the specimen with a comparable ABO blood group.
 The sinusoidal endothelial cells were also diffusely and strongly positive for UEA-I receptors.
 In contrast, in cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis a few sinusoidal endothelial cells were positive for ABH blood group antigens and UEA-I receptors.
 In normal livers, only a few sinusoidal endothelial cells were positive for ABH blood group antigens and UEA-1 receptors.
 Tests for factor VIII-related antigen and Lewis blood group antigens were almost negative on sinusoidal endothelial cells.
 Although type IV collagen was distributed diffusely in the space of Disse in these four groups, its expression was strongest in HCC.
 Blood vessels of portal tracts and fibrous septa were positive for ABH blood group antigens, UEA-1 receptors, factor VIII-related antigen, and type IV collagen, but negative for Lewis blood group antigens.

 Fifty-one patients were placed randomly into two controlled passive-motion protocols.
 Group 1 patients received greater intervals of passive-motion rehabilitation using a continuous passive-motion device.
 Group 2 patients were treated with a traditional early passive-motion protocol for tendon rehabilitation.
 For Group 1 patients, the mean interval of controlled motion rehabilitation was 75 hours a week, and the mean number of cycles was 12,000.
 For Group 2 patients the mean interval of controlled passive motion was four hours a week, and the mean number of cycles was 1000.

 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether long-term amiodarone treatment is associated with a rise in plasma cholesterol, and, if so, to analyze its relation with thyroid function.
 DESIGN: Consecutive entry trial, including cardiac patients who initiated amiodarone medication but excluding those with abnormal thyroid function (defined as peak thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH] less than 2.8 or greater than 22.0 mU/L) either before or during amiodarone treatment.
 PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients who remained euthyroid were studied.
 INTERVENTION: Oral administration of amiodarone (mean duration of treatment, 17 months; range, 6 to 30 months).
 MEASUREMENTS: Fasting plasma lipids, thyroid hormones, and peak TSH to TRH values were recorded before and every 6 months during amiodarone treatment.
 RESULTS: Plasma cholesterol gradually increased from 5.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/L before treatment to 6.9 +/- 0.8 mmol/L after 30 months of amiodarone medication (P less than 0.001); the peak TSH response to TRH did not change.
 When age- and sex-specific reference values were applied, 30% of the patients had cholesterol values above the 75th percentile before treatment; this number rose to 69% after 2 years of treatment.
 The rise in plasma cholesterol was associated with an equal increase in apoprotein B.
 Plasma cholesterol was not related to the daily dose of amiodarone or to plasma concentrations of amiodarone, desethylamiodarone, thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), or reverse triiodothyronine (rT3).
 Linear regression analysis indicated a positive relation between plasma cholesterol and the cumulative dose of amiodarone (r = 0.25, P less than 0.05).
 CONCLUSION: Long-term amiodarone treatment is associated with a dose-dependent increase in plasma cholesterol that is independent of thyroid function.

2022,"Dimerization of mammalian progesterone receptors occurs in the absence of DNA and is related to the release of the 90-kDa heat shock protein.
 In this study we have demonstrated that dimerization of mammalian progesterone receptors (PR) occurs in the absence of DNA.
 A specific immune coisolation assay was performed on extracts of T-47D human breast cancer cells with a monoclonal antibody specific for the full-length B form of progesterone receptor (PR-B).
 This resulted in coisolation of significant amounts of truncated form-A receptors (PR-A), indicating the presence of stable PR-A.PR-B dimers in solution.
 A positive correlation was observed between the ability of different receptor forms to oligomerize in solution and their ability to bind to specific DNA sequences.
 The ability to form stable PR-A.PR-B oligomers in the absence of DNA was also found to correlate with release of 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) from the unactivated PR complex.
 These results support the hypothesis that dimerization in the absence of DNA is an important mechanism controlling receptor DNA-binding function and that hsp90 release may be a key step regulating dimerization.
 This suggests that hsp90 may function to repress DNA-binding activity indirectly by blocking receptor dimerization.

 Pharmacologic and immunologic methods of ex-vivo bone marrow (BM) purging for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) were combined to augment the effect of either method alone.
 Etoposide (VP16; 20 to 30 micrograms/mL) with or without cytosine arabinoside (Ara C; 10 mg/mL) was used in tandem with the anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), MY9, chosen because CD33 is found on the stem cell pool in the majority of patients with ANLL.
 The agents were tested singly or sequentially, with a 1-hour incubation of the drugs preceding complement-mediated lysis using MY9.
 VP16 combined with Ara C killed up to 3.9 +/- 0.3 and 5.11 +/- 0.4 logs of the human ANLL cell lines HL60 and K562 at drug concentrations that killed only 1.2 +/- 0.1 logs of normal committed granulocyte/macrophage stem cells (CFU-GM).
 Adding a single exposure of the MY9 and complement (C') to the drug-treated cells, greater than 5.4 logs of HL60 were killed.
 Similar to other pharmacologic agents, no differential kill for clonagenic leukemic cells (colony-forming unit-leukemia; CFU-L) from patients with ANLL was seen for drug only treated blasts versus normal CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), with less than 1 log CFU-L kill at drug concentrations that spared 1 log of CFU-GM.
 Similarly, only 1.1 +/- 0.3 logs of ANLL CFU-L were eliminated using MY9 and C'.
 However, with the sequential VP16/Ara C----MY9 + C' treatment, synergy was demonstrated and 2.6 +/- 0.3 logs of CFU-L were eliminated.
 Because CD33 is also found on the normal CFU-GM pool, two-stage long-term BM cultures were performed to determine pluripotent stem cell elimination by the drug/MoAb purging combination.
 No difference of CFU-GM or BFU-E production at 4 to 6 weeks of culture for VP16/Ara C, MY9 + C', or VP16/AraC----My9 + C' treated cells was seen compared with untreated controls indicating sparing of early progenitor cells.
 Sequential ex vivo treatment of human ANLL CFU-L with VP16/Ara C followed by complement-mediated lysis using MY9 synergistically kills CFU-L while sparing early normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, and thus may be a more effective way to purge BM than either alone.

 Based on our findings that changes in wall shear stress, not the rate of blood flow, were the main hemodynamic factor related to intimal hyperplasia of autologous vein grafts, we further investigated the effect of wall shear stress variation on sequential ultrastructural changes in the intimal hyperplasia of arterially transplanted autovein grafts, using canine models.
 As noted, wall shear stress variation (tau-variation) could be defined by the variation in wall shear stress within a cardiac cycle, using a desktop flow waveform analyzer.
 In Group I, which had a high flow rate of 78.4 +/- 4.6 ml/min and low tau-variation of 36.1 +/- 2.2 dynes/cm2, intimal hyperplasia was significant.
 Ultrastructurally, there was a marked transformation of intimal smooth muscle cells to secretory cells 2 to 4 weeks after implantation.
 The surface of the intima was lined with modified smooth muscle cells at 2 weeks after implantation.
 In Group II, which had a low flow rate of 5.6 +/- 2.2 ml/min and normal tau-variation value (174.6 +/- 13.0 dynes/cm2), intimal hyperplasia was minimal, and there were several layers of contractile type smooth muscle cells, with characteristic myofibrillae.
 The surface of the intima was lined with endothelial cells at 2 weeks after implantation.
 These findings suggest that, in regions of low wall shear stress variation, intimal smooth muscle cells of autovein grafts may well become secretory cells, and enhanced platelet adherence could occur during early intimal repair, causing intimal hyperplasia to develop.

2026,"A strategy to reduce infant mortality.
 Using maternal mortality reviews as an historic model, fetal and infant mortality reviews are proposed to reduce infant mortality in the United States.
 The national program has three elements: 1) guidelines and direction from a national multidisciplinary steering panel and staff, 2) a technical advisory capacity to translate guidelines and to work with local and regional review committees, and 3) local review committees.
 A special emphasis, lacking in the limited efforts of previous infant mortality reviews, would be given to fetal mortality.
 The plan proposes a broad classification of potential contributing causes of mortality, from those related strictly to medical care, to the health system, and to individual patient factors.
 This will allow different and more effective targeted responses to factors identified locally.
 Critical impetus will be gained with The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists leading the effort from the private medical sector in partnership with national, state, and local public health agencies and other national medical societies.

 Consistent correlations have been found between physical dysfunctional states and blood factors.
 Some of these disorders have possible psychosomatic components (eg, duodenal ulcer, myocardial infarction).
 This study focused on the relationship between blood types and various indices of behavior patterns (eg, type A behavior scores, anger ratings) in young patients who had had an initial myocardial infarction.
 Patients with blood type O scored significantly higher on type A behavior scales and related indices than those having blood type A.
 Those with blood group B responded on several scales between those with types A and O.

 The concertina effect is a phenomenon where the QRS complexes reflect alternating phases of gradual widening and narrowing.
 This is most commonly due to ventricular pre-excitation, and the changes in QRS morphology are due to variability of the ventricular zone that undergoes pre-excitation.
 This presentation reflects a case where the concertina effect is due to an idioventricular tachycardia at a rate nearly identical to the sinus rate.
 Variable degrees of ventricular fusion therefore occur, and the concertina effect ensues, in relation to slight variations of the sinus cycle.

2031,"Effect of cardiac output reduction on rate of desaturation in obstructive apnea.
 The nadir of SaO2 during an obstructive apnea is dependent upon the apnea's duration and the rate of fall of saturation (dSaO2/dt).
 We postulated that a low Q, such as in patients with congestive heart failure with sleep apnea, or a reduction in Q, as seen in some humans during obstructive sleep apnea, might steepen dSaO2/dt.
 The mechanism postulated was lowering of SvO2 with increased pulmonary capillary blood oxygen uptake and faster depletion of alveolar oxygen.
 This study examines dSaO2/dt following the onset of apnea in eight spontaneously breathing adult baboons.
 Nonrepetitive obstructive apneas (30, 45, and 60 seconds) were created by clamping an indwelling cuffed endotracheal tube at the end of expiration.
 Following baseline measurements, the animals were given a bolus of a rapid-acting beta-adrenergic blocker followed by continuous infusion to reduce cardiac output and to limit the cardiovascular response to obstructive asphyxia.
 Fiberoptic catheters were used for continuous monitoring of SaO2, SvO2, and cardiac output.
 Esophageal pressure and relative thoracic gas volume (Respitrace) were monitored to insure equivalence of lung volume at the onset of apnea.
 Beta-adrenergic blockade reduced resting Q by a mean of 25 percent.
 The blocked vs unblocked dSaO2/dt was 0.73 vs 0.72 percent/s, 0.76 vs 0.73 percent/s, and 0.70 vs 0.71 percent/s for 30-second, 45-second, and 60-second apneas, respectively.
 Thus, mean dSaO2/dt for all durations of apneas was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade.
 We concluded that dSaO2/dt is not influenced by limited Q preceding or induced by obstructive asphyxia.

 The entire population of otolaryngologists and radiation oncologists (N = 192) in active practice in the state of North Carolina were surveyed to assess their level of awareness of illiteracy among adults in the United States and to determine whether these physicians consider illiteracy in the treatment decision process for patients with head and neck cancer.
 Excluding respondents who did not treat patients with head and neck cancer and physicians practicing outside of the state of North Carolina, the response rate was 115 of 182, or 63%.
 Only 26% of respondents were able to estimate correctly the prevalence of illiteracy in the US adult population.
 Forty-one percent of respondents, however, stated that they did consider their patient's ability to read and/or write before making treatment recommendations for head and neck cancer.
 This survey and accompanying literature review suggest that physicians perceive illiteracy as a problem that may have a significant impact on patients with head and neck cancer, but lack the data needed to enable them to quantify the effect of illiteracy on treatment outcome.
 The study reported is the first step in examining ways in which illiteracy might negatively affect patient outcomes.

 Extended ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in the patient's customary environment provides clear evidence of circadian patterns in myocardial ischemic episodes.
 In patients with effort angina, the highest activity occurs between 6 AM and noon.
 This coincides with peaks in diurnal variation of frequency of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death.
 A number of potential underlying common triggering mechanisms, including catecholamine secretion, sympathetic nervous system activity, blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol secretion, and aggregability of platelets, exhibit similar surges.
 As a result of these coinciding morning peaks, myocardial oxygen demand is increased and oxygen supply reduced after a person arises in the morning.
 Attention to this vulnerable period is merited in the timing and choice of medication, both to prevent or reduce ischemia and to modify potential disease-triggering mechanisms.

 Three pairs of twins, each with proved monozygosity, were shown to be discordant for dementia of the Alzheimer's type and to have remained discordant for periods of 8 to 11 years.
 Dementia of the Alzheimer's type was demonstrated by history; serial clinical examinations; serial measurements of cerebral glucose utilization using positron emission tomography and of cerebral ventricular volumes and of rates of change of volumes using quantitative computed tomography; and by serial neuropsychological tests.
 The results of each of these measures showed no evidence of clinical abnormality in any unaffected twin.
 DNA markers from the proximal long arm of chromosome 21 did not distinguish between the affected and the unaffected member of any pair of identical twins.
 Family pedigrees were negative for Alzheimer's disease.

 This article reviews the clinical experience with cryosurgery (use of liquid nitrogen) and acrylic cementation (polymethylmethacrylate; PMMA) in the treatment of aggressive, benign bone sarcomas and the biologic basis of this technique.
 The results of 25 patients below the age of 21 treated by cryosurgery, with an average follow-up period of 60.8 months, are reported.
 Three approaches to surgical reconstruction were used: Group 1 (four patients) had cryosurgery with no reconstruction, Group 2 (13 patients) had bone graft reconstruction alone, and Group 3 (eight patients) had composite osteosynthesis with internal fixation, bone graft, and/or PMMA.
 The overall control rate was 96% (one recurrence).
 The tumor types were giant-cell tumor, chondroblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, and malignant giant-cell tumor.
 Nineteen lesions involved the lower extremity, and six lesions were located in the upper extremity.
 There were two secondary fractures (8%), one local flap necrosis, and one synovial fistula.
 There were no infections.
 Two epiphyseodeses were performed.
 The functional results were excellent (83%), good (13%), and fair (4%).
 The technique of composite osteosynthesis is recommended for all large tumors of the lower extremity.
 Cryosurgical results compare favorably with those obtained by en bloc resection and demonstrate the ability of cryosurgery to eradicate tumors while avoiding the need for extensive resections and reconstructive procedures.

 Anatomic profile (AP) components A, B, and C summarize serious injuries (greater than AIS 2) to the head/brain or spinal cord; to the thorax or front of the neck; and all remaining serious injuries.
 Relationships between AP components and survival rate reaffirm the seriousness of head injury.
 Logistic function models relating AP components and the Injury Severity Score (ISS) to survival probability were based on 20,946 Major Trauma Outcome Study (MTOS) patients (9.2% mortality rate) submitted through 1986.
 Model performance comparisons were based on 5,939 MTOS patients (7.8% mortality rate) submitted during 1987.
 The AP better discriminated survivors from nonsurvivors and provided a 31% increase in sensitivity when compared with the ISS.
 Neither the ISS nor the AP alone reliably predict patient outcome.
 The predictive power of methods for estimating patient survival probability which include physiologic indices or profiles, patient age, and an anatomic profile should be compared with current methods.
 The AP, which is based on the severity and location of all serious injuries, provides a more rational basis for comparing patient samples than the ISS.

 Anthropometric, hormonal and liver function parameters were examined in 18 premenopausal women with a history of early alcohol abuse, and compared with the data for randomly selected controls of the same age.
 The alcoholic women showed slightly elevated levels of transaminases, but no clinical or laboratory signs of advanced liver damage.
 These women were characterized by an increased waist-to-hip ratio, due to enlarged waist circumference.
 Several endocrine abnormalities were found, including irregular or absent menses as well as low oestrogen, progesterone and delta-4-androstendione levels.
 The concentration of free testosterone was high and that of sex-hormone-binding globulin was low.
 These data suggest abdominal distribution of body fat, as well as hyperandrogenicity in alcoholic, premenopausal women.

 Over a 10-year period from 1976 to 1985, of 1818 patients hospitalized for burns, 85 (4.7%) injuries were due to hot grease or oil.
 The mean age was 20 years; 34% of patients were less than 8 years old.
 The mean total body surface areas of second- and third-degree burns was 11.5% (range 0.5% to 40%), and the average length of hospital stay was 19.6 days.
 Fifty-eight percent of patients required split-thickness skin grafting (n = 49), three required intubation, and one required tracheostomy.
 Seventy-eight percent of oil burns occurred in the home.
 The most common circumstances consisted of children who grabbed the handle or electric cord of a frying pan and pulled the hot oil down onto themselves.
 (Nineteen of the 29 children were less than 8 years old (66%).) Burns due to cooking oil and grease are associated with considerable morbidity.
 The high boiling point, high viscosity, and potential combustibility of oil increase the potential soft-tissue damage when compared with typical scald injuries from hot water.

 Demonstration of disordered blood flow in a coronary artery may be helpful in anticipating the presence of stenosis.
 To examine the possibility of disordered coronary blood flow associated with left main coronary stenosis, left main coronary flow was visualized by transesophageal Doppler color flow echocardiography in 52 patients undergoing coronary angiography.
 Twenty patients had significant left main coronary stenosis (Group 1) and 32 patients did not (Group 2).
 Adequate two-dimensional echocardiographic images of the left main coronary artery were obtained in 17 patients in Group 1 and 30 patients in Group 2.
 Sixteen patients in Group 1, including five patients in whom the stenosis could not clearly be defined by two-dimensional echocardiography, exhibited the aliased reddish-yellowish elements producing the mosaic pattern at the stenotic or poststenotic segments, or both.
 In contrast, nonaliased bluish jets, suggesting laminar flow away from the transducer, were seen in echocardiograms from 27 patients in Group 2.
 This group included four patients with stenosis-like images on two-dimensional echocardiography.
 The aliased mosaic pattern was found in only three patients in Group 2 (p less than 0.01).
 Thus, sensitivity to detect the stenosis was improved when Doppler color flow imaging was applied.
 Flow velocity was significantly higher at the site of stenosis in patients in Group 1 (116 +/- 28 cm/s, n = 10, mean +/- SD) than in Group 2 (29 +/- 12 cm/s, n = 21, p less than 0.01), suggesting that the augmentation of flow velocity with or without turbulence due to the stenosis contributed to the appearance of the mosaic flow images.

2043,"Interaction of chloramphenicol and metabolites with colony stimulating factors: possible role in chloramphenicol-induced bone marrow injury.
 We have recently demonstrated that two chloramphenicol (CAP) metabolites known to be produced by intestinal bacteria, dehydro-CAP (DH-CAP) and nitrophenylaminopropane (NPAP), are much more cytotoxic to bone marrow in vitro than CAP itself.
 Since colony stimulating factors (CSFs) play an essential role in hematopoietic cell growth, toxicity from CAP metabolites could also involve interaction with CSF or CSF-producing cells.
 In the present study, we found that increasing concentrations of rhGM-CSF or rhG-CSF completely reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP (2 x 10(-4) M) on human CFU-GM growth and on the growth of KG-1 cells.
 GM-CSF also reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP on HL-60 cells.
 Inhibition by DH-CAP (50% at 5 x 10(-7) M), nitroso-CAP (NO-CAP) (60% at 5 x 10(-6) M) and NPAP (35% at 10(-5) M) was not affected by either CSF.
 In addition to their inhibitory effect on cell growth, DH-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) and NO-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) inhibited CSF production by buffy coat cells 50-70% without affecting cell viability.
 Neither CAP nor NPAP inhibited CSF production.
 It is suggested that the dual toxic-inhibitory effect of some intestinal metabolites of CAP such as DH-CAP on hematopoietic cell growth on the one hand, and on CSF production on the other, renders them very potent as potential mediators of CAP induced aplastic anemia.

 Many growth factors regulate the cytoplasmic Raf-1 protein kinase, consistent with its having a central role in transduction of growth signals.
 The kinase is ubiquitously expressed and can promote proliferation, presumably in a manner dependent on growth-factor receptors and membrane-associated oncogenes.
 We have now examined the dependence of serum- and TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-regulated NIH/3T3 cell growth on RAF-1 kinase to determine whether Raf-1 is essential for receptor signalling.
 We inhibited Raf-1 function by expressing c-raf-1 antisense RNA or kinase-defective c-raf-1 mutants.
 Antisense RNA for c-raf-1 interferes with proliferation of normal NIH/3T3 cells and reverts raf-transformed cells.
 In revertant cells, DNA replication induced by serum or TPA was eliminated or reduced proportionately to the reduction in Raf protein levels.
 Expression of a kinase-defective Raf-1 mutant (craf301) or a regulatory domain fragment (HCR) inhibited serum-induced NIH/3T3-cell proliferation and raf transformation even more efficiently.
 Inhibition by antisense RNA or craf301 blocked proliferation and transformation by Ki- and Ha-ras oncogenes.
 We conclude that raf functions as an essential signal transducer downstream of serum growth factor receptors, protein kinase C and ras.

 Only two were initially recognized as LMS; the others had been diagnosed as malignant fibrous histiocytoma (two) and fibrosarcoma (one).
 The patients, four of whom were women, ranged in age from 32 to 70 years.
 Sites included proximal humerus (two), distal femur (two), and rib (one).
 All tumors presented with clinical and radiographic features consistent with a diagnosis of primary bone neoplasms, although one probably represented a solitary metastasis from a primary uterine LMS.
 Radiographs showed lytic bone destruction with a moth-eaten appearance, and three cases had soft tissue extension.
 Histologically, all tumors showed broad, interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with pleomorphic nuclei, frequent mitoses, and necrosis.
 Two cases had a focal storiform pattern and bizarre multinucleated cells, and two other cases had focally prominent osteoclast-like giant cells.
 Extensive immunoreactivity for muscle actin was seen in all cases and for desmin in three.
 In each case, electron microscopy showed definite smooth muscle differentiation including cytoplasmic filaments with densities.
 At this writing, two patients are free of disease (including the patient with a presumed metastasis), one is alive with locally recurrent disease, and two are dead of disease.
 Experience suggests that LMS of bone is a distinct clinicopathologic entity that may be more common than previously recognized.

 The mechanisms by which growth factors are degraded and the role this process plays in the regulation of cell growth are not well understood.
 Insulin degradation is believed to be mediated by a specific metalloprotease, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE).
 We have previously shown that IDE can also degrade transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha), but not epidermal growth factor (EGF), in vitro.
 This selectivity was surprising, since TGF alpha and EGF are structurally similar and bind to the same receptor with comparable affinities.
 Using a spectrum of protease inhibitors, we have now analyzed the degradation of TGF alpha, EGF, and insulin by human hepatoma HepG2 cells.
 The results suggest that bacitracin-sensitive metalloproteases are involved in the degradation of TGF alpha and EGF as well as insulin, and that the degradation of TGF alpha, but not EGF, is mediated in part by IDE.
 Inhibiting the activity of these metalloproteases decreased growth factor depletion, suggesting that these enzymes play an important role in the control of extracellular growth factor levels.
 The existence of separate degradative pathways for EGF and TGF alpha may explain how the two factors exert differential effects in some systems, and degradation of TGF alpha by IDE would provide a possible mechanism for interaction between the insulin and TGF alpha/EGF signalling systems.

 A reduction in fiber diameter might explain the decrease in the maximal tension in the soleus, whereas this tension was unaltered in the gastrocnemius and the plantaris.
 Moreover the calcium sensitivity of the myofilament appeared modified in the soleus and in the gastrocnemius: The tension/pCa relationships were shifted toward higher calcium concentrations, indicating a decrease in the apparent calcium binding constant of the troponin C.
 The tension/pCa relationship appeared unaltered in the plantaris after spaceflight.
 Finally, the studies of the time to reach a steady tension indicated an increase in the rate of force development in the soleus and, on the contrary, a slowing down in the plantaris.

 Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sutures have been used for replacement of diseased chordae tendineae during reconstructive procedures on the mitral valve in 43 patients.
 There were 28 men and 15 women whose mean age was 55 years, range 21 to 76.
 Three fourths of the patients were in New York Heart Association class III or IV.
 Replacement of primary chordae tendineae of the anterior leaflet was performed with 4-0 or 5-0 polytetrafluoroethylene sutures.
 A double-armed suture was passed twice through the fibrous portion of the papillary muscle head and tied down.
 Each arm of the suture was brought up to the free margin of the leaflet and passed through the area where the native chorda was attached.
 After the lengths of the two arms were adjusted, the ends were tied together on the ventricular side of the leaflet.
 Thirty patients had degenerative disease of the mitral valve; the incompetence was due to prolapse of the anterior leaflet in 14 patients and prolapse of the anterior and posterior leaflets in 16.
 Eleven patients had rheumatic mitral valve disease: four had stenosis, three had regurgitation, and four had mixed lesions.
 Two patients had ischemic mitral regurgitation caused by rupture of a papillary muscle head.
 There were no operative deaths.
 Patients have been followed up from 5 to 61 months, mean 13.

 Previous efforts to block the renin-angiotensin system in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) have focused on 2 distal sites in the system, the angiotensin-converting enzyme and the angiotensin II receptor.
 Recent work, however, has led to the development of agents that directly inhibit renin, the proximal step in the cascade.
 In this study, we investigated the hemodynamic effects of renin inhibition in 9 patients with chronic CHF by using enalkiren, a primate-selective, dipeptide renin inhibitor, which has been previously shown to suppress plasma renin activity and to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients.
 The acute intravenous administration of enalkiren (1.0 mg/kg) produced increases in cardiac index (2.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.3 +/- 0.1 liter/min/m2) and stroke volume index (26 +/- 3 to 34 +/- 4 ml/m2) and decreases in left ventricular filling pressure (31 +/- 3 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg), mean right atrial pressure (15 +/- 1 to 13 +/- 2 mm Hg), heart rate (78 +/- 5 to 72 +/- 6 beats/min) and systemic vascular resistance (2,199 +/- 594 to 1,339 +/- 230 dynes.s.cm-5) (all p less than 0.01 to 0.05).

 Ki-67 labeling was quantified in 37 nonmalignant breast tissues and in 63 breast carcinomas by counting ten random high-power fields each in three section planes (RC) or by evaluation of the area with the highest labeling density (HDC).
 Both procedures proved to be highly correlated (rs = 0.94).
 Ki-67-positive fractions of the nonmalignant tissues (mean, 2.1% for RC and 4.1% for HDC) were significantly lower as compared with the carcinomas (mean, 14.5% for RC and 17.5% for HDC).
 In carcinomas the Ki-67 labeling was significantly associated with pT stage, axillary lymph node status, and tumor grading and inversely related to progesterone receptor status.
 Using the medians of both counting methods (12% for RC and 17% for HDC) as cutoff points, significantly different curves for overall and disease-free survival (median follow-up, 37 months) were obtained.
 However, Cox multivariate analysis failed to demonstrate an independent effect of Ki-67 labeling.
 In contrast, Ki-67 reactivity seems to be of independent prognostic value if a higher cutoff level was selected.

2058,"Diltiazem increases late-onset congestive heart failure in postinfarction patients with early reduction in ejection fraction. The Adverse Experience Committee; and the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Research Group 
 The Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial (MDPIT) reported no consistent diltiazem effect on new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) during 12-52 months' follow-up after acute myocardial infarction.
 This was puzzling in light of the observation that patients with findings suggesting left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) at baseline on diltiazem had more cardiac events (cardiac mortality or recurrent nonfatal infarction) than such patients on placebo.
 We hypothesized that diltiazem increased the frequency of late CHF as well as of cardiac events, but only in patients predisposed by LVD.
 Using the same characterizing variables as the primary MDPIT analysis, we found that patients with pulmonary congestion, anterolateral Q wave infarction, or reduced ejection fraction (EF) at baseline were more likely to have CHF during follow-up than those without these markers of LVD.
 CHF was particularly frequent in the patients with LVD who were randomized to diltiazem.
 Among those with a baseline EF of less than 0.40, late CHF appeared in 12% (39/326) receiving placebo and 21% (61/297) receiving diltiazem (p = 0.004).
 Life table analysis in patients with an EF of less than 0.40 confirmed more frequent late CHF in those taking diltiazem (p = 0.0017).
 In addition, the diltiazem-associated rise in the frequency of late CHF was progressively greater with increasingly severe decrements in baseline EF.
 This diltiazem effect was absent in patients with pulmonary congestion at baseline but an EF of 0.40 or more, suggesting a unique association between diltiazem-related late CHF and systolic LVD.

2059,"Inositol phosphate formation in the human squamous cell carcinoma line SCC-12 F: studies with bradykinin, the calcium ionophore A23187, and sodium fluoride.
 The phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositides is an important signal transduction pathway coupled to the cell-surface receptors for several hormones and growth factors.
 In addition, PLC activity can be modulated by changes in intracellular calcium and activation of GTP binding proteins.
 In this report, differential activation of PLC in the human keratinocyte cell line SCC-12F was studied as judged by specific patterns of inositol phosphate formation.
 Several hormones and growth factors previously shown to stimulate PLC in a variety of cell types were screened for activity in SCC-12F cells.
 Only bradykinin was active, stimulating the PLC-dependent generation of inositol (1,4,5) triphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3).
 Ins(1,4,5)P3 was rapidly metabolized to inositol(1,4)biphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2) and inositol(1,3,4,5)tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), and subsequently degraded to inositol monophosphates.
 The response elicited by bradykinin was concentration dependent (EC50 value of 50 nM), suggesting involvement of a specific bradykinin receptor.
 Treatment of these cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 appeared to result in the direct formation of Ins(1,4)P2 without Ins(1,4,5)P3 as precursor.
 Treatment of the cells with AIF4-, a putative activator of GTP binding proteins, resulted in the generation of inositol monophosphates as the major metabolites in the absence of detectable Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation.
 Taken together, these observations suggest that the PLC complex present in SCC-12F cells can be differentially activated to yield either Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,4)P2, or InsP.
 The observed effects may be due to a direct PLC-dependent hydrolysis of the appropriate membrane phosphoinositide.

2060,"Structural and functional integrity of ovarian tumor tissue obtained by ultrasonic aspiration.
 For patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, survival increases when residual disease approaches zero after surgical removal of the tumor.
 A previous study using the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) (Cavitron Lasersonic Corp., Stamford, CT) showed the successful removal of ovarian tumors from areas often considered unresectable: the diaphragm, spleen, stomach, and small bowel.
 However, the CUSA has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for gynecologic surgery except on an experimental basis.
 This study was designed to test whether ultrasonic irradiation produced by the CUSA caused alterations in cell structure or physiology of gynecologic tissue in adjacent areas.
 Paired tumor samples, unirradiated and irradiated, were obtained from ten patients, and portions were sent for pathologic structural evaluation and physiologic tissue culture evaluation.
 Histologic sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, showed that CUSA irradiation produced only minor tissue distortion as observed under the light microscope.
 A correct diagnosis would have been made in all cases had only tissue fragments obtained from the CUSA specimen trap been stained.
 For nine of ten patients, initial tumor cell viability was similar in the two specimen types.
 Flow cytometric DNA analysis confirmed that surgical methods produced matched samples.
 Cells that survived high-frequency ultrasound appeared functionally intact.
 For five of eight patients, the cells from the CUSA specimen traps survived and/or divided to a greater extent than those from the knife-dissected tumors.
 Cells from both surgical routes attained a similar number of passages in culture.
 It seems reasonable to extrapolate these in vitro observations with pelvic tumor tissues to normal surrounding tissue left in situ.
 Thus pelvic tissue is believed to be uninjured by CUSA ultrasonic irradiation.

2061,"Methodologic issues in assessing the quality of life of cancer patients.
 Although quality of life assessments have been employed successfully in descriptive and evaluative studies in oncology, their use in cancer clinical trials has, to date, been limited.
 A range of issues have impeded the conduct of clinical trial-based quality of life investigations.
 These include: the absence of theoretical models to guide the development of quality of life measures; over-reliance on ad hoc approaches to quality of life assessment; and insufficient attention to the practical constraints operating in clinical research settings.
 Of primary importance is the need to develop multidimensional quality of life instruments that are brief and psychometrically robust.
 It is suggested that future work on instrument development focus on refining currently available generic or cancer-specific measures, and on developing new diagnostic-specific questionnaire modules.
 This psychometric work should be guided by appropriate theoretical models of the relationship among health-related quality of life domains.
 Although it is widely accepted that the patient represents the most appropriate source of quality of life data, it is suggested that efforts also be directed toward improving the validity and reliability of physician-generated assessments of patients' performance status and of treatment toxicities, and toward determining the feasibility of employing family members as proxy raters of the psychologic and social health status of patients who are unwilling or unable to provide such information.
 Additional attention should be paid to the many logistical problems that arise in clinical trial-based quality of life investigations.
 In particular, research designs and data collection procedures should be selected that minimize patient, medical staff, and institutional burden.

 The relationship between breast cancer and two trace elements, zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu), was investigated by means of an hospital based case-control study at Milan (Italy) and Montpellier (France).
 Variables concerning dietary intake of Zn and Cu (in Milan) and their blood levels (both in Milan and Montpellier) were measured.
 Dietary intake, evaluated through a questionnaire of the dietary history type, and blood levels of Zn and Cu were measured in 261 cases and 261 controls.
 Cu blood level showed a contradictory tendency in the two samples (higher in controls in Milan, higher in cases in Montpellier), which tended to lessen after adjustment for related variables.
 No odds ratios (OR) in the different quantiles, nor X2 for trend reached statistical significance.
 A sharp difference was evidenced on the opposite with regard to Zn blood values in cases and controls.
 In both samples Zn mean values are significantly higher in cases than in controls, and the difference remains significant in the two samples even after adjustment for related variables.
 The pooled OR computed from the two samples, after adjustment for known risk factors and related variables, reaches in the fourth quartile a value of 9.5 (CI: 4.9-18.2).
 Dietary intake of the two minerals (measured only in Milan sample) showed no difference between cases and controls, but a stronger relationship between dietary and blood Zn was evidenced in cases with respect to controls.
 The authors suggest that the higher Zn level in cases might be related with an higher incorporation of Zn in cancer cases and that the same mineral might play a possible role in tumor growth promotion.

 OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the role of leukocyte depletion during initial reoxygenation with normal blood and blood cardioplegic reperfusates in limiting reperfusion damage.
 METHODS: Twenty-eight dogs underwent 2 hours of ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery.
 The initial reperfusate (37 degrees C) was delivered on total vented bypass to the left anterior descending artery by a calibrated pump via an internal mammary artery graft at 50 mm Hg for 20 minutes.
 Eight dogs received normal (normokalemic, nonenriched) blood reperfusion (leukocyte count 8000/mm3) and six were reperfused with leukocyte-depleted normal blood (leukocyte count less than 100/mm3).
 Of 14 dogs reperfused with substrate-enriched (hyperkalemic) blood cardioplegic solution, six received a cardioplegic solution with a leukocyte count less than 100/mm3.
 RESULTS: Leukocyte depletion of normal blood reduced reperfusion-induced arrhythmias from 63% to 17% (p less than 0.05).
 Coronary vascular resistance at initial reperfusion was low and remained low during substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic reperfusion with both normal and reduced leukocyte counts.
 In contrast, coronary vascular resistance rose 63% with normal blood reperfusion, and this increase was avoided by leukocyte depletion (2.6 versus 4.0 mm Hg x ml/min, p less than 0.05).
 Coronary vascular resistance after 20 minutes was, however, higher than that with blood cardioplegia with normal or decreased leukocyte counts.
 Negligible functional recovery followed reperfusion with normal blood and leukocyte-depleted blood (12% and 6% of control systolic shortening).
 In contrast, substantial segmental recovery followed blood cardioplegic reperfusion (73% systolic shortening, p less than 0.05) but was not improved by leukopheresis (81% systolic shortening).
 Leukocyte depletion of normal blood reperfusate reduced histochemical damage from 53% to 38% (p less than 0.05), but the least histochemical damage followed blood cardioplegic reperfusion with a normal or reduced leukocyte count (8% or 11%, p less than 0.05).
 CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an important role for leukocytes in reperfusion damage, but reperfusate leukocyte filtration alone is inferior to blood cardioplegic reperfusion.
 Leukocyte depletion of blood cardioplegic solutions seems unnecessary after only 2 hours of ischemia.

2068,"Clinical choices for circulatory assist devices.
 Approximately 1.0% of open heart surgery patients become unweanable from cardiac bypass during the surgical procedure.
 In addition, nearly 20% of patients accepted for cardiac transplantation die while waiting for a donor heart.
 Pulsatile pneumatic ventricular assist devices (VADs) provide a realistic solution to these dilemmas.
 Currently, there are five manufacturers who are competing for the major market share in the clinical use of these devices.
 Novacor, Thermetics, Thoratec, Symbion, and Abiomed all have competitive VAD systems.
 Because no one system is optimal for all patients, the limitations, similarities, and strengths of each system should be known to enhance the patient's outcome when using these devices.
 Successful use of VAD systems, either as a bridge to transplantation or to ventricular recovery, is best approached by adherence to strict patient selection.
 Once instituted, VAD management centers on detailed attention to anticoagulation and prompt diagnosis and treatment of various complications.

2069,"Neutrophil influx into an inflammatory site inhibited by a soluble homing receptor-IgG chimaera.
 Neutrophil-mediated inflammation is involved in a number of human clinical manifestations, including the adult respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and reperfusion injury.
 One way of inhibiting this type of inflammatory response would be to block competitively the adhesive interactions between neutrophils and the endothelium adjacent to the inflamed region.
 The lectin-containing murine adhesion molecule gp90MEL, the homing receptor, is found on all leukocytic cells, including neutrophils.
 MEL 14, a monoclonal antibody directed against this adhesion molecule, blocks lymphocyte traffic to lymph nodes and extravasation of neutrophils from blood to inflammatory sites.
 Here we show that administration to mice of a soluble immunoglobulin chimaera containing the murine homing receptor extracellular domain significantly decreases the number of neutrophils that migrate to the peritoneum in response to the inflammatory irritant thioglycollate.
 These results indicate that soluble forms of a single type of adhesion molecule, the homing receptor, could be clinically effective compounds for the inhibition of neutrophil-mediated inflammation.

2071,"Estimating left ventricular filling pressure during positive end-expiratory pressure in humans.
 In the critically ill, accurate measurements of left ventricular (LV) filling pressure using pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (Ppao) are important for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
 In patients receiving positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), Ppao may not reflect LV filling pressure because of elevated pericardial pressure (Ppc).
 It has been proposed that in humans, Ppc and right atrial pressure (PRA) are equal, so that referencing Ppao to PRA may improve the assessment of LV filling pressure when Ppc is elevated.
 Similarly, it has also been shown in the dog that nadir Ppao immediately after airway disconnection from PEEP (nadir Ppao), accurately reflects LV filling pressure when LV filling pressure is greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg.
 We examined methods of estimating LV filling pressure using Ppao measurements under conditions in which increases in Ppc were the primary determinants of differences in the two measurements.
 Using left atrial pressure (PLA) relative to Ppc, called transmural PLA (PLAtm), as LV filling pressure, we compared the accuracy of Ppao, nadir Ppao, and Ppao relative to PRA to reflect PLAtm in 15 postoperative cardiac surgery patients in whom an air-filled pericardial balloon catheter and a left atrial catheter were inserted during surgery.
 PEEP was sequentially increased from zero to 15 cm H2O.
 We found that PRA always exceeded Ppc (p less than 0.01) and increased less with PEEP than did Ppc (p less than 0.05).
 At less than or equal to 5 cm H2O PEEP, both Ppao and nadir Ppao were similar to each other and to PLAtm.

2072,"Study on the genesis of the double potential recorded in the high right atrium in atrial flutter and its role in the reentry circuit of atrial flutter.
 To investigate the genesis of the double potential (DP), which is two separate waves, and its role in the reentry circuit of atrial flutter (AF), we performed overdrive pacing (ODP) from the high right atrium (HRA) in six cases of spontaneous AF in which the DP was recorded in the HRA.
 In four of the six cases, when the DP was arbitrarily designated D1 and D2, D1 and D2 showed progressive fusion during ODP.
 In addition, the D1 return cycle, immediately after the termination of ODP, corresponded to the AF cycle, and the D2 return cycle corresponded to the pacing cycle.
 This may indicate that the DP is caused by the collision of two directional waves.
 Furthermore, it is suggested that the HRA plays an important role in preventing a possible shortcutting of reentry waves and in stabilizing the reentry circuit of AF.

 Risks are provided for various prior population risks, for various levels of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, and for various assumptions about the sensitivity of ultrasonographic examination.
 The formula used is based on sequential multiplication of odds with the use of Bayes' theorem, but an arbitrary reduction (to the power of 0.5) in the degree to which ultrasonographic information modifies the odds has been made to allow for the nonindependence of ultrasonography and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein tests.

 In the treatment of the classical and endemic African forms of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been widely used with varying degrees of success and morbidity.
 We here report our preliminary experiences with low doses of recombinant interferon alfa-2b (rIFN alpha-2b) in the treatment of these types of KS, non-linked to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
 Ten consecutive patients (eight patients with classical and two with endemic KS) with a median age of 62 years were treated long-term with 5 X 10(6) units of rIFN alpha-2b (Introna) given subcutaneously three times weekly for at least 6 months.
 Of the 10 patients, six presented with cutaneous disease only, and four had additional visceral involvement.
 After 6 months of treatment, seven of the 10 patients had a major response of the cutaneous lesions, and three patients showed stable skin diseases.
 Of the four patients with additional visceral disease, one patient showed a complete regression of an intramyocardial tumor involving the right atrium and ventricle, whereas in the three other patients stabilization of the visceral lesions with marked symptomatic improvement occurred.
 On the whole, the long-term results over a median duration of 12 months (range, 7 to 30) are also satisfactory: IFN-alpha continued to control KS in all patients.
 The treatment was generally well tolerated; no serious side effects were observed.
 Our preliminary data suggest that low-dose rIFN alpha-2b regimens are effective in classical and endemic African KS.
 However, further studies are needed to establish the exact role for IFN-alpha as alternative to radiation and chemotherapy.

 We have studied the intracellular brain pH in 22 patients after head injury (mean Glasgow Coma Score 6.1).
 Patients were investigated by a combined approach of phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (overall examination time 50-75 min) at a mean time of 11 days after injury (36 hours to 24 days).
 31P spectra were obtained in 11 patients on assisted ventilation and in 11 patients on spontaneous ventilation.
 These spectra were analyzed to yield the pH in the regions studied in all the patients.
 All pH values were in the normal or alkalotic range when compared with 6 age-matched normal controls.
 No differences were found between patients on assisted ventilation and patients on spontaneous ventilation.
 When analyzed as a group, the brain pH in the focal lesions appeared to increase in the first days, to reach a peak in the alkalotic range in the second week, and to return toward normal within 3 weeks from acute injury.
 Our results suggest that there is no evidence of posttraumatic intracellular brain acidosis in recent human head injury, and therefore, therapies aimed at alkalinizing brain cells need to be reconsidered.

 In 15 (7.3%) patients impaired arterial perfusion due to vascular spasm with or without thrombus formation was seen in the cannulated leg after catheterisation.
 Despite heparinisation, signs of impaired arterial circulation persisted in nine patients (4.4% of the total).

2078,"Recognition and management of digitalis intoxication: implications for emergency medicine.
 Digitalis intoxication is among the most common serious adverse drug reactions in clinical medicine.
 While the recent development of a radioimmunoassay to accurately measure serum concentrations of digoxin has been of assistance, digitalis intoxication remains a difficult diagnosis to make with certainty.
 The difficulty in diagnosing digitalis intoxication arises from the nonspecificity of its associated signs and symptoms.
 The most common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, nausea, and anorexia.
 These symptoms can occur with many illnesses other than digitalis intoxication.
 Similarly, the electrocardiographic disturbances caused by cardiac glycosides may be nondiagnostic.
 The arrhythmias commonly associated with digitalis toxicity are often nonspecific and can be a reflection of the patient's underlying heart disease.
 The measurement of serum digoxin levels is useful, but studies have demonstrated overlap of the levels between groups with and without toxicity.
 Due to the modulation of the cardiac effects of digitalis glycosides by such clinical variables as underlying myocardial or renal disease, electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, and other factors, the correlation of toxicity with particular serum digoxin concentrations may vary.
 Because of the inherent difficulties in confirming the diagnosis of digitalis intoxication in some cases, digoxin-specific Fab antibodies may play a role as a diagnostic tool.
 Certainly, digoxin-specific Fab antibodies play a significant part in the treatment of digitalis intoxication.
 Fab antibodies have been successfully used to reverse the effects of digoxin, digitoxin, and oleander poisoning.
 These antibodies are useful in the treatment of acute and chronic digitalis intoxication in all age groups, including geriatric and pediatric populations.

 We wished to determine if reduction in the standard heparin administration for cardiopulmonary bypass could be accomplished safely with the use of membrane oxygenators.
 An experimental study was designed to evaluate two different heparin administration protocols for cardiopulmonary bypass with hollow-fiber membrane oxygenators.
 Two groups of six pigs were submitted to hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (28 degrees C) for 3 hours, then rewarmed, decannulated, and reassessed after 1 hour.
 In group I (control) heparin was administered to maintain the activated clotting time in excess of 450 seconds; in group II activated clotting time was maintained between 250 and 300 seconds.
 The mean total heparin administered was 41,000 units in group I and 25,000 units in group II.

 No significant difference in any of these coagulation parameters was observed between the groups.
 The performance of the oxygenators was similar in both groups, with no evidence of thrombosis.
 Thus reduced heparin administration, enough to keep activated clotting time between 250 and 300 seconds, was not related either to major coagulation factors and platelet consumption or to derangements in the oxygenator's performance.

 All those with a positive initial test had rectosigmoidoscopy to 60 cm and a double contrast enema.
 A carcinoma was found in one in seven patients with a positive retest but in only one in 100 patients with a negative retest (P less than 0.001).
 The specificity of the test was, therefore, increased from 95 per cent to 98 per cent and the sensitivity was unchanged.
 Rescreening was offered at a later date and increased numbers were available: 7147 patients returned the test and 369 (5.2 per cent) were positive.
 The test was repeated in 360 patients and 118 (1.7 per cent) were positive.
 A colorectal neoplasm was found in one in three of those with a positive repeat test, compared with one in seven of those with a negative repeat test.
 In conclusion, screening for early detection of colorectal cancer with a rehydrated Hemoccult II test may be followed by investigation of only those patients with a positive retest.
 Such a procedure will reduce the work-load by 60 per cent without reducing sensitivity.

2082,"Efficacy and safety of doxazosin in the treatment of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension and elevated levels of cholesterol.
 In hypertensive patients, elevated serum cholesterol is a frequent and sinister additional coronary risk factor.
 Selective alpha 1-adrenoreceptor inhibitors appear to have the unique ability to control both risk factors.
 Forty-two patients, ages 42 to 65 years, including 21 men with sustained hypertension and elevated serum cholesterol levels, were included in a trial of monotherapy with doxazosin administered once daily (range, 1 to 16 mg).
 The influence of the drug on high blood pressure and elevated serum cholesterol was evaluated over a 28-week period, which consisted of a 4-week, single-blind placebo lead-in period, an open 10-week dose-adjustment period, and finally a 14-week maintenance period.
 Of the 39 efficacy-evaluable patients, 25 (64%) achieved adequate blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure greater than 10 mm Hg) at a mean daily dose of 2 mg of doxazosin.
 No persistent changes occurred in heart rate.
 In the 32 patients with evaluable lipid data, there were nonsignificant trends to an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a reduction in total cholesterol, together with a significant reduction in serum triglyceride concentration.
 The combined changes in blood pressure and blood lipid levels resulted in a reduction of 36% in the calculated risk of coronary heart disease.
 Eleven patients reported side effects and four were withdrawn from therapy.
 These results confirm the antihypertensive and anticholesterolemic efficacy of once-daily treatment with doxazosin.

 In mongrel dogs, 56 autologous lymphatic and vein grafts were interpositioned to bridge a defect in the femoral collecting lymphatics.
 In one group, 26 lymphatic autografts were interpositioned with good results.
 No obstruction was observed over 6 months.
 In another group, 20 venous autografts were interpositioned after irrigation with heparinized saline and another 10 autografts were interpositioned without irrigation.
 After 1 week, four irrigated grafts were partially occluded with a red thrombus; after 6 months, all grafts were totally occluded.
 In a third group, 15 lymphaticolymphatic anastomoses were enveloped by a silicone sheet to provoke prolonged devascularization.
 None of the vessels was patent.
 Anastomotic patency was inspected in vivo postoperatively.
 The specimens were studied with light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy.
 Prolonged devascularization damaged the endothelial cells.
 The results show that the lymphatic vessel autograft is the best choice for an interpositional autografting to bridge a defect in lymphatic vessels.

2084,"Drug response at electropharmacologic study in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias: the importance of ventricular refractoriness.
 The clinical and electrophysiologic predictors of successful antiarrhythmic drug therapy for patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia were evaluated in 59 consecutive patients undergoing serial electropharmacologic trials.
 Structural heart disease was less frequently present in patients for whom effective therapy was found (p less than 0.05).
 The presence of coronary artery disease and a history of prior myocardial infarction were significantly more frequently present in patients for whom antiarrhythmic drug therapy could not be found (p less than 0.05).
 The corrected QT interval and ventricular effective refractory period measured at a pacing cycle length of 400 ms were significantly shorter in responders compared with nonresponders (QT interval 428 +/- 52 versus 460 +/- 59 ms; ventricular effective refractory period 237 +/- 28 versus 254 +/- 24 ms; (p less than 0.05).
 In addition, the interelectrogram coupling interval of the ventricular extrastimulus initiating ventricular tachycardia was significantly shorter in responders compared with nonresponders (223 +/- 37 versus 251 +/- 33 ms; p = 0.003).
 Logistic regression analysis identified a short ventricular interelectrogram coupling interval (p less than 0.01) and absence of prior myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05) as the only independent predictors of antiarrhythmic drug suppression of the induction of ventricular tachycardia.
 Greater drug-induced increments in the ventricular effective and functional refractory periods were observed in responders than in nonresponders as was the shortest ventricular interelectrogram coupling interval.
 Thus, baseline electrophysiologic measurements identify patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia who are likely to respond to antiarrhythmic drug therapy.
 Furthermore, these patients demonstrate greater drug-induced electrophysiologic changes.

 Among the 4129 patients of the Community Hospital-based Stroke Program, 30% had an unspecified stroke diagnosis.
 Since specific diagnosis and, perhaps, eventual treatment, derives in part from diagnostic testing, we examined the effect of clinical condition, geographic and demographic factors on the incidence of certain diagnostic tests after acute stroke.
 In this multivariable analysis, race, sex, history of hypertension and history of diabetes did not influence the chance of having any test, but older age strongly reduced the chances of receiving extensive evaluation.
 When CT scanning was available, the utilization of a CT as well as other diagnostic studies including cerebral angiography, radionuclide brain scan, EEG and EKG was increased.
 The odds of receiving a CT scan increased if the patient was married, and decreased with a history of previous stroke.
 A history of previous TIA increased the chance of having a cerebral angiogram while a history of cardiac disease decreased the chance.
 There were striking regional geographic differences in the use of CT, radionuclide brain scanning and cerebral angiography which may, in part, reflect differences between the availability of these technologies in urban and rural hospitals.
 These results indicate that evaluation of stroke patients remains heterogenous.

2087,"Identification of three related human GRO genes encoding cytokine functions.
 The product of the human GRO gene is a cytokine with inflammatory and growth-regulatory properties; GRO is also called MGSA for melanoma growth-stimulatory activity.
 We have identified two additional genes, GRO beta and GRO gamma, that share 90% and 86% identity at the deduced amino acid level with the original GRO alpha isolate.
 One amino acid substitution of proline in GRO alpha by leucine in GRO beta and GRO gamma leads to a large predicted change in protein conformation.
 Significant differences also exist in the 3' untranslated region, including different numbers of ATTTA repeats associated with mRNA instability.
 A 122-base-pair region in the 3' region is conserved among the three GRO genes, and a part of it is also conserved in the Chinese hamster genome, suggesting a role in regulation.
 DNA hybridization with oligonucleotide probes and partial sequence analysis of the genomic clones confirm that the three forms are derived from related but different genes.
 Only one chromosomal locus has been identified, at 4q21, by using a GRO alpha cDNA clone that hybridized to all three genes.
 Expression studies reveal tissue-specific regulation as well as regulation by specific inducing agents, including interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and lipopolysaccharide.

2088,"Potentiation of the erythropoietin response by dimethyl sulfoxide priming of erythroleukemia cells: evidence for interaction of two signaling pathways.
 Erythropoietin (Epo) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are believed to induce the differentiation of transformed erythroid cells by different signal transduction pathways.
 We have now obtained evidence for the interaction of these pathways.
 We used a Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cell line with a relatively low (8% to 10%) hemoglobinization response to Epo alone.
 Pretreatment of these cells for 1 day with DMSO followed by its removal and the addition of Epo resulted in a marked enhancement of the Epo specific hemoglobinization.
 We have designated this effect ""DMSO priming."" This priming effect of DMSO on the Epo response was both time-dependent and DMSO concentration-dependent.
 DMSO priming potentiated the Epo response in three ways.
 Firstly, DMSO priming increased the total number of Epo responsive cells from 8% to 10% to 40% to 60%.
 Secondly, DMSO priming reduced the time required to reach the optimal Epo-induced response from 4 days to 2 days.
 Thirdly, the Epo dose-response curve was left-shifted approximately 20-fold.
 DMSO priming was also associated with a marked increase in Epo receptor density characterized by an apparently new receptor population and by the appearance of positive cooperativity between receptors.
 Our results suggest that the DMSO priming effect is due to potentiation of the Epo signaling pathway, thus resulting in a much more rapid and dramatic Epo-induced hemoglobinization response.

2089,"Taste reactivity in alcohol preferring and nonpreferring rats.
 Taste reactivity tests were used to examine the orofacial responses of alcohol preferring (P) rats and alcohol nonpreferring (NP) rats to the taste of alcohol.
 In the initial exposure, naive rats were tested for reactivity to five concentrations of alcohol (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% v/v), water, and one solution each of sucrose and quinine.
 A two-bottle consumption test was then given for a 3-week period to allow the rats access to 10% alcohol.
 After the preference test, a second taste reactivity test was done using the same solutions as in the initial reactivity test.
 The results indicated no significant differences in taste reactivity between P rats and NP rats on the initial exposure, except that NP rats made significantly more mouth movements.
 During the two-bottle tests, consumption of alcohol by P rats was consistently higher than that of NP rats across all test days.
 On the second taste reactivity test, P rats showed an increase in the number of ingestive responses and a decrease in the number of aversive responses to alcohol.
 NP rats' taste reactivity to alcohol remained unchanged from Exposure 1 to Exposure 2.
 P rats' and NP rats' responses to sucrose and quinine did not change from Exposure 1 to Exposure 2.
 It was concluded that there were no innate taste response differences between P and NP rats to alcohol but that following alcohol experience, P rats showed a significant increase in ingestive responses and a concomitant decrease in aversive responses to the taste of alcohol.

 Myeloperoxidase (MPO) synthesis is known to be associated with the promyelocyte stage of myeloid differentiation.
 In particular the downregulation of MPO gene transcription is associated with myeloid cell maturation.
 We examined the changes in the deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitive sites within the 5' end of the MPO gene and its 5' flanking region during dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells to determine the changes in chromatin structure that accompany this process.
 The locations of hypersensitive sites surrounding the 5' end of the gene in proliferating, uninduced cells were determined: three were observed in the 5' flanking region and one within the gene.
 Progressive changes in all sites accompanied the downregulation of MPO transcription after treatment with DMSO.
 No evidence of hypersensitivity was observed in the chromatin region examined after 8 days of DMSO exposure.
 The results provide an example of the changes that occur in the chromatin structure of a gene as it is inactivated during differentiation.

 The milliwatt CO2 laser was used to perform end-to-end anastomoses in canine jugular veins.
 There was a high disruption rate (50%) in laser-welded veins (n = 10).
 Fibrin glue (n = 17), formed from human fresh-frozen plasma, enhanced the weld strength decreasing the disruption rate (18%), resulting in an 82% patency which nearly equaled the contralateral sutured vein patency (93%).
 The bursting strength was improved with fibrin glue.
 Transmural necrosis was present initially in all groups but extended for a longer distance in the vessel wall in laser-welded anastomoses.
 Sutured anastomoses exhibited a greater inflammatory response.
 In laser-welded anastomoses endothelial cells were not as confluent as in sutured anastomoses by six weeks.
 Carbon dioxide laser-welded end-to-end vein anastomoses appear to be impractical because they disrupt too easily.
 However, the addition of heterologous fibrin glue to the weld results in a reasonably strong anastomosis with histologic properties that may be beneficial in vein bypass grafts.

 The differential diagnosis of the dementia syndrome may pose a difficult clinical problem, since the most common dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is marked by normal laboratory tests.
 Neuroimaging has played an important role in evaluating the demented patient, and its uses are growing.
 Computed tomography (CT) is useful for excluding reversible and treatable causes of dementia, such as subdural hematoma and tumor.
 More recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has improved our ability to diagnose vascular disease and may show the presence of cerebral infarcts and white matter disease not visible on CT.
 Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), techniques that visualize such cerebral functions as glucose metabolism and blood flow, may provide positive evidence supportive of the diagnosis of AD.

 Seismic communication, through low-frequency and patterned substrate-borne vibrations that are generated by head thumping, and which travel long distances underground, is important in the nonvisual communication of subterranean mole rats of the Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies (2n = 52, 54, 58, and 60) in Israel.
 This importance pertains both intraspecifically in adaptation and interspecifically in speciation.
 Neurophysiologic, behavioral, and anatomic findings in this study suggest that the mechanism of long-distance seismic communication is basically somatosensory and is independent of the auditory mechanism.
 Seismic communication thus appears to be a channel of communication important in the evolution of subterranean mammals that display major adaptation to life underground.

 Gilles de la Tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and reduced penetrance at a single genetic locus.
 Several research groups have genetic linkage studies underway to detect the chromosomal location of the gene that predisposes for this disorder.
 Strong and clear evidence of linkage has not yet been produced for Tourette syndrome.
 This paper presents an overview of the methods and progress of the groups centered at Yale University and Erasmus University in excluding linkage from a large portion of the genome.
 Our labs have screened 228 genetic marker loci for linkage with a gene for this disorder in a series of affected families in the United States, Canada, The Netherlands, and Norway.
 More than 50% (and perhaps as much as 66%) of the autosomal genome has now been excluded on the assumption that genetic heterogeneity is not an important factor in the Tourette syndrome pedigrees pooled for this summary.

2099,"Availability of transplantable organs from brain stem dead donors in intensive care units.
 OBJECTIVE--By audit from January to June 1989 to quantify, separately for hearts, kidneys, liver, lungs and corneas, the possible increases in transplantable organs from brain stem dead potential donors in intensive care units and to compare them with the increases achieved in October-November 1989, during intense, national publicity about transplantation.
 DESIGN--Prospective audit of all deaths in intensive care units in England from 1 January to 30 June 1989 and subsequent case study of the impact of publicity on offers and donations during October-November 1989.
 SETTING--15 regional and special health authorities in England.
 PATIENTS--5803 patients dying in intensive care units, of whom 497 were confirmed as brain stem dead and had no general medical contraindication to organ donation.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Organ specific suitability for transplantation (as reported by intensive care units); consent for donation of specific suitable organs; and procurement of specific organs reported as suitable for transplantation and offered.
 RESULTS--In the 497 (8.6%) brain stem dead potential donors were estimated the organ specific suitability for heart as 63%, kidneys 95%, liver 70%, lungs 29%, and corneas 91%.
 Refusal of relatives (30%) accounted for major losses of suitable organs of all types.
 For kidneys the loss was equivalent to 44% of brain stem dead actual kidney donors.
 No discussion of organ donation was the second most important reason for missed kidney donors, the loss being equivalent to 10% of brain stem dead actual donors.
 Non-procurement or difficulties with allocating organs was the second most notable cause of missed suitable liver and lung donors; 29% (55) of the offered total of 189 liver donors and 27% (21) of 78 offered suitable lung donors in six months.
 Non-procurement of suitable, offered organs was rare for kidneys and modest, of the order of 13% and 10% respectively, for heart and corneas.
 Corneal donation from brain stem dead potential donors might be improved nearly as much (that is, a 78% increase in brain stem dead actual corneal donors) by specific measures to promote corneal donation when other organs are offered as by reducing the overall refusal rate.
 Restricted offers, non-procurement, and no discussion of donation accounted for nearly equal numbers of lost donations of hearts (each equivalent to 15% of donated hearts).
 During October-November 1989 when there was intense, positive publicity about transplantation the rates of refusal and non-discussion fell compared with during January-June (22%, 36/163 v 30%, 138/460; 7%, 33/497 v 2%, 4/167 respectively).
 Offers of suitable donors increased significantly (p less than 0.02) compared with the first six months of 1989, most notably for heart donors (80 v 60.1 expected) and kidney donors (122 v 102.1 expected) but only for kidneys was there a noticeable 17% increase in actual donors (118 actual audited donors v 100.8 expected donors; p = 0.09).
 CONCLUSIONS--Four strategies to increase the supply of transplantable organs from brain stem dead potential donors in intensive care units were identified: (a) reducing refusal of relatives (b) avoiding non-procurement of actually suitable organs (by logistical initiatives) and deterioration of initially suitable organs (by donor care initiatives); (c) converting restricted offers to unrestricted offers; and (d) ensuring discussion with families.
 Early referral to the transplant team or coordinator gives time for discussion about donor care and agreement on medical suitability for donation of specific organs.
 Solving some of the logistical problems of non-procurement may be a prerequisite for increased offers to be translated into increased donations.
 The impact of publicity therefore needs to be measured on offers of suitable donors as well as by actual donations.

 This case-control study of 31 specialized dementia units and 32 traditional units in five states investigated use of physical and pharmacologic restraints among 625 patients with the diagnosis of dementia.
 Physical restraints were observed in use on 18.1% of dementia unit patients and on 51.6% of comparison unit patients who were out of bed during the day (adjusted odds ratio, 0.283;95% confidence interval, 0.129 to 0.619).
 Pharmacologic restraints were routinely given to 45.3% of dementia unit patients and 43.4% of comparison unit patients (adjusted odds ratio, 0.950; 95% confidence interval, 0.611 to 1.477).
 We used multivariate logistic regression to identify residence in a nonspecialized nursing home unit, nonambulatory status, transfer dependency, mental status impairment, hip fracture history, and a high nursing staff-to-patient ratio, which we found to be independent predictors of physical restraint use.
 Physically abusive behavior, severe mental status impairment, and frequent family visitation were found to be significant predictors of pharmacologic restraint use, while advanced patient age, large nursing home size, and patient nonambulatory status were protective against such use.
 These results support the conclusion that physical and pharmacologic restraint constitute separate treatment modalities with different risk factors for use, and indicate that specialized dementia units are successful in reducing the use of physical but not pharmacologic restraints.

 The survival of children in the South East Thames region, born between 1970 and 1979 and diagnosed as having some form of cerebral palsy was investigated.
 Of the 732 children studied, 651 (90%) are still alive, and hence cerebral palsy must be regarded as a condition with which people live rather than a condition of which they die.
 Survival varies considerably among the different diagnostic groups: those suffering from spasic quadriplegia, dyskinetic and 'mixed' cerebral palsy are most severely affected.
 Our evidence suggests that, though immobility and severe mental subnormality are the strongest predictors of mortality in children with cerebral palsy, the majority of even the most severely affected patients survive to adulthood.
 It is therefore appropriate to plan for their survival by funding and evaluating programmes to maximise health, independence, and quality of life.

 Reperfusion injury characterized by loss of endothelial cell viability occurs after cold ischemic storage of livers for transplantation surgery.
 Here, ultrastructural changes in stored rat livers were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy.
 With increasing times of storage in Euro-Collins solution (4 to 24 hr) followed by 15 min of reperfusion at 37 degrees C, a sequence of structural alterations was observed involving endothelial and Kupffer cells.
 Widening of endothelial fenestrations occurred after 4 hr and progressed over 8 to 24 hr to retraction of cellular processes, ball-like rounding, sinusoidal denudation and ultrastructural derangements consistent with loss of cell viability.
 Kupffer cells exhibited progressive rounding, ruffling of the cell surface, polarization, appearance of wormlike densities, vacuolization and degranulation over a similar time course.
 By contrast, the structures of parenchymal and fat-storing cells were relatively undisturbed by cold storage and reperfusion.
 Alterations to endothelial and Kupffer cells were also studied as a function of time of reperfusion.
 After 24 hr of storage, endothelial cells showed retraction of cytoplasm before reperfusion that progressed quickly to loss of viability and denudation during reperfusion.
 Kupffer cell activation (ruffling, degranulation) during reperfusion was slower and occurred after deterioration of endothelial cells.
 Livers stored in Euro-Collins solution were also compared with livers stored in University of Wisconsin cold storage solution, an improved preservation medium for transplantation.
 University of Wisconsin solution provided better preservation of endothelial structure and markedly reduced parenchymal cell blebbing and swelling before reperfusion.
 University of Wisconsin solution also reduced Kupffer cell activation and release of lysosomal enzymes.
 In conclusion, endothelial cell deterioration followed by Kupffer cell activation occurred after increasing times of cold ischemic storage and reperfusion of rat livers.
 Both changes may contribute to the pathophysiology of graft failure caused by reperfusion-mediated storage injury.

 Additionally, the antigen levels of the blood in patients with lymphatic invasion or node metastases were significantly higher than those in patients without the invasion or the metastases, and every patient without the invasion showed no elevation of the antigen.
 These results suggest that production of the antigen in cancer cells may be a premise of CA19-9 elevation in peripheral blood and that CA19-9 may be drained by the thoracic duct of the lymphatic system via node metastases or invasive lymphatics, but not by the hematogenous portal system.

2109,"Accumulation of erythrocyte nucleotides and their pattern in lead workers.
 Nucleotides in erythrocytes of lead-exposed subjects were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
 Most of the pyrimidine levels correlated well with blood lead concentrations (Pb-B) and pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (P5N) activity.
 Highly significant correlations were found between Pb-B and uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucose (UDPG), cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP), or CDP-choline (CDPC).
 The levels of these compounds were sharply elevated when P5N activity was reduced to levels less than 7 mumole/h.g hemoglobin (Hb), which corresponded to a Pb-B of 60 micrograms/100 g.
 Therefore, concentration of these nucleotides may provide a useful index of lead poisoning.
 Adenosine 5'-triphospate (ATP) concentrations were correlated negatively with Pb-B, whereas adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) concentrations were correlated positively with Pb-B.
 These results suggest that lead affects not only pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism but also purine nucleotide metabolism (energy production system).

 We attempted to assess the importance of blood transfusion, donor seropositivity, and prednisolone therapy as risk factors for cytomegalovirus infection in cyclosporin-treated renal allograft recipients.
 Primary infection was diagnosed in 27 of 86 patients (31 per cent) and recurrent infection in 27 of 79 patients (34 per cent).
 Receipt of banked blood from unselected donors after transplantation did not increase the incidence of primary infection in the few transfused patients.
 Kidney donor seropositivity and maintenance prednisolone in addition to cyclosporin were associated with increases in the incidence of primary or recurrent infection, respectively.
 Cytomegalovirus infection was clinically mild.
 Presumed bacterial pneumonias occurred in three patients with recurrent cytomegalovirus infection.
 The absence of severe cytomegalovirus disease probably reflected the minimal use of prednisolone.
 Matching of seronegative donors with seronegative recipients seemed unjustifiable in cyclosporin-treated renal transplant patients.

2112,"Transhepatic portal vein catheterization for localization of insulinomas: a ten-year experience.
 One of the most important factors in the management of insulinomas is the ability to localize the tumor accurately either before or during surgery.
 We prospectively carried out transhepatic portal venous sampling (THPVS) for tumor localization in 35 of 40 patients with organic hyperinsulinism during a 10-year period.
 In 32 patients who underwent THPVS and in whom a single tumor was subsequently identified surgically, the maximal insulin gradient was located in the vicinity of the tumor in 100% of cases.
 Specific regionalization of the tumor on the basis of the site of the maximal insulin gradient to one of three regions (the tail, the body/neck region, and the head/uncinate region) gave a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 91%.
 In contrast, the use of specific cutoff levels for the insulin gradient as a guide to the presence of a tumor in one of these three regions did not increase the accuracy, leading instead to a significant loss of sensitivity with no comparable increase in specificity.
 There were no major complications from the procedure in any patient.
 The initial use of computed tomographic/ultrasound scanning and selective angiography localized only 46% of tumors, whereas subsequent THPVS led to the accurate preoperative localization of 100% of all tumors submitted to surgery.
 Although the surgeon would have identified 81% of the tumors correctly at operation, in 19% (n = 6) he would have failed.
 Four tumors were in the uncinate and two were in the head.
 It seems that in patients with proved or established organic hyperinsulinism, THPVS may continue to be of value, if only to regionalize the tumor, especially those in the pancreatic head and uncinate process so as to preclude noncurative operations on the body and tail of the pancreas.

2113,"Intracranial hypertension in relation to memory functioning during the first year after severe head injury.
 The relationship between intracranial hypertension and residual memory deficit after closed head injury was evaluated using the 6-month and 1-year neurobehavioral outcome data obtained by the Traumatic Coma Data Bank.
 Intracranial pressure was analyzed using the percentage of time that it exceeded 20 mm Hg and the maximum value recorded during the first 72 hours after injury.
 Memory measures included recall of word lists, prose recall, and visual memory for designs that were obtained 6 months (n = 149) and 1 year (n = 132) after injury.
 Intracranial hypertension occurred in more than half of the Traumatic Coma Data Bank cohort who met the criteria for the neurobehavioral follow-up study.
 Linear regression analysis disclosed an effect of elevated intracranial pressure on some, but not all, measures of memory at 6 months, whereas the results were negative for the 1-year follow-up examination.
 We conclude that the elevation of intracranial pressure exerts little if any effect on later memory functioning, and that any effect it does have diminishes over 1 year in survivors of severe head injury.

 This is a prospective study to evaluate therapeutic arthroscopy for internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).
 Fifty-nine patients with 76 abnormal joints were evaluated preoperatively for pain, noise, maximal incisal opening (MIO), and deviation on opening.
 Preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained for 29 joints.
 Patients were treated by superior joint arthroscopy, lysis of adhesions, lavage, and steroid injection, along with preoperative and postoperative splint and physiotherapy.
 Pain, noise, and motion were evaluated at three time periods: 1) early (10 to 30 days); 2) intermediate (1 to 6 months); and 3) late (greater than 6 months).
 At early, intermediate, and late follow-up, increase in MIO was statistically significant (P less than .05).
 Noise did not return in the majority of patients.
 Disc position, evaluated by MRI, did not appear to change in 25 of 29 joints and did not correlate with clinical outcome.
 The results of this study indicate that TMJ arthroscopy is effective in reducing pain and increasing motion in patients with TMJ internal derangement.

 The purpose of this study was to determine the possible association between positive family background of alcohol abuse (having a parent or grandparent who sometimes or often drank too much) and the amount of alcohol consumed per week among college students.
 It was additionally to determine the possible differences between students with positive, compared to students with negative, family backgrounds of alcohol abuse in regards to drinking patterns, using a survey instrument that indirectly measures family background for alcohol abuse.
 For this cross-sectional study, a quota sample of 971 college students from all four regions of the United States was selected.
 Results revealed no association between family history and mean amount of alcohol consumed per week for the total sample (r = .007), or for men (r = .04) or women (r = .02).
 Curve analysis indicated a slightly positively skewed curve for the total group and also for male and female students.
 A t test and chi-square analysis found no significant difference between positive and negative family backgrounds and mean amount of alcohol consumed or drinking patterns.
 Among those with positive family backgrounds there was no clustering on a scatter plot for either heavy or light amounts of alcohol consumed.
 The results showed remarkable similarity in alcohol consumption and drinking patterns between students who were classified as having a positive, as opposed to negative, family background.
 It was concluded that having a positive family background for heavy drinking was not associated with either light or heavy alcohol consumption among this national sample of college students.

2117,"Transcriptional regulation of ferritin messenger ribonucleic acid levels by insulin in cultured rat glioma cells.
 Recent data have shown that ferritin, a ubiquitous protein, has a role as a regulator of cellular differentiation.
 In the present study we have investigated the expression of ferritin mRNAs in cultured C6 cells, a rat glioma cell line, in response to insulin, which has an important role in cellular growth and differentiation.
 Insulin stimulated steady state levels of both ferritin heavy chain and ferritin light chain mRNAs.
 An increase in the level of ferritin heavy or light chain mRNA was detected after 2 h of incubation with insulin, and a plateau was reached after 48 h for heavy chain mRNA and after 72 h for light chain mRNA.
 The responses were dose-dependent and were maximal at 100 nM for both mRNAs.
 Treatment of cells with actinomycin-D showed that insulin had no effect on the posttranscriptional stability of these mRNAs.
 Actinomycin-D inhibited insulin-induced accumulation of both mRNAs, suggesting transcriptional stimulation of ferritin genes by insulin.
 A nuclear run-on assay showed that the insulin-induced increase in ferritin heavy chain mRNA was due to an increase in the rate of gene transcription.
 We also demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) increased ferritin heavy and light chain mRNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion, and that the maximum effect was obtained at a concentration of 10 nM on both mRNA levels.
 IGF-I was not only 10-fold more potent, but the absolute level of maximum stimulation was also about 2-fold greater than that for insulin.
 The combination of insulin (100 nM) and IGF-I (10 nM) showed no additive effect.
 The results suggested that the ferritin heavy and light chain genes are transcriptionally regulated by insulin and influenced by IGF-I.

 Recently purified and molecularly cloned monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF) may play a major role in recruiting and activating monocytes in the inflammatory process.
 We examined the effects of a potent anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone (DXS), on the production of this factor.
 Over a wide range of concentrations (10(-5) to 10(-8) M), DXS inhibited the production of MCAF at the mRNA and protein level in a human fibrosarcoma cell line, which was stimulated with either IL-1 or TNF-alpha.
 We examined the turn-over of synthesized MCAF mRNA that showed DXS decreased the stability of MCAF mRNA.
 Furthermore, the addition of actinomycin D and cycloheximide abolished this effect of DXS, indicating that de novo mRNA and protein synthesis were required for this process.
 In addition, a nuclear run-off analysis revealed that DXS also inhibited the transcription of IL-1- or TNF-activated MCAF genes.
 Therefore, both the destabilization of MCAF mRNA and the inhibition of transcription of the gene contribute to the decrease in the MCAF mRNA steady state level by DXS.

 This study investigated the safety and efficacy of doxazosin treatment in a large population of patients (n = 336) with essential hypertension and assessed the effect of doxazosin on the serum lipid profile and the calculated risk of developing coronary heart disease.
 Patients were assigned to two groups: those with a baseline diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg (group 1) and those with a baseline diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg (group 2) that was controlled by previous antihypertensive therapy.
 Doxazosin treatment (monotherapy in 76.2% of patients) significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the blood pressure of patients in group 1 (-23/-17 mm Hg) after 10 weeks and maintained the control of blood pressure for patients in group 2.
 Heart rate was essentially unchanged in both groups.
 Mean final daily doses of 3.6 and 3.2 mg were achieved in groups 1 and 2, respectively.
 Treatment with doxazosin improved the severity category of hypertension for 88.4% of patients in group 1; 87.3% of patients were considered a therapy success.
 Doxazosin had a favorable effect on the serum lipid profile in both groups of patients.
 The majority of lipid changes achieved statistical significance and resulted in a significant 27% decrease in the calculated risk of developing coronary heart disease.
 Doxazosin was well tolerated; only 24.1% of patients had side effects that were related or possibly related to treatment.
 In nine (2.7%) patients the dose of doxazosin was reduced and 26 (7.7%) patients withdrew from doxazosin therapy because of side effects.

 The interference of nicardipine and diltiazem infused into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates, with the forearm vascular response to graded exogenous norepinephrine, was evaluated in hypertensive patients.
 Nicardipine (1 and 3 micrograms/dl forearm tissue/min in both absence and presence of propranolol) increased forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography) and antagonized dose dependently the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine, suggesting that functional alpha-antagonism may participate in the vasodilating and possibly the antihypertensive effect of the drug.
 On the contrary, no antagonism but rather potentiation of the responses to norepinephrine occurred after diltiazem (0.5 and 1 microgram/dl forearm tissue/min).
 Because intra-arterial propranolol abolished that potentiating action of the drug, whereas the local vasodilation to isoproterenol was clearly reduced, diltiazem probably interfered with beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasorelaxing mechanisms in human forearm arterioles.
 The data further stress the heterogeneity of calcium entry blockers in humans.

 High values for sensitivity and specificity were found for detecting obstruction of the carotid siphon and main stem of the middle cerebral artery.
 Diagnostic reliability of transcranial Doppler sonography was also confirmed by the calculation of a chance-corrected measure of agreement (kappa), which was close to + 1 in all subanalyses.

 In 1985, a facial paresis slowly developed.
 There was no gross evidence of recurrent melanoma in the ear or neck, but CT scan showed a mass in the region of the stylo mastoid foramen.
 A reoperation of the primary site revealed metastatic melanoma in the facial nerve, expanding it to approximately 10 times its normal size.
 A composite resection was done for the melanoma, and the paralyzed face was immediately rehabilitated by a masseter muscle transfer.

 The effects of unloading a depressed heart were assessed in terms of optimal coupling between the ventricle and arterial system.
 To assess the effects of preload on ventricular load coupling, preload was reduced with a lower body negative pressure of -20 mm Hg.
 Nitroprusside was used to evaluate the effects of afterload on the coupling under the condition that preload reduction was comparable to that with lower body negative pressure.
 In 13 patients with heart failure (ejection fraction 32 +/- 3%, mean +/- SE), direct arterial pressure was simultaneously recorded with the left ventricular echocardiogram as the pressure was elevated by phenylephrine.
 Left ventricular contractile properties were defined by the slope (Ees) of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation.
 The effective arterial elastance (Ea) was expressed by the slope of the end-systolic pressure-stroke volume relation.
 Left ventricular external work, end-systolic potential energy and work efficiency, defined as external work per pressure volume area (external work + potential energy), were determined.
 Baseline ventricular load coupling in these patients was characterized by an increase in the ratio of arterial elastance to ventricular elastance (Ea/Ees) (1.96 +/- 0.31).
 This ratio decreased significantly, to 1.45 +/- 0.22, with nitroprusside, and increased to 2.37 +/- 0.34 with lower body negative pressure.
 Therefore, end-systolic potential energy was decreased by nitroprusside but was unaltered by lower body negative pressure while external work was comparably decreased by both manipulations, indicating that work efficiency was significantly augmented with nitroprusside but declined with lower body negative pressure.

 To determine the association of skin color, measured by a reflectometer, with blood pressure in US blacks, we studied a community sample of 457 blacks from three US cities.
 Persons taking antihypertensive medications were excluded.
 Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were higher in darker persons and increased by 2 mm Hg for every 1-SD increase in skin darkness.
 However, the association was dependent on socioeconomic status, whether measured by education or an index consisting of education, occupation, and ethnicity, being present only in person with lower levels of either indicator.
 Using multiple linear regression, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained significantly associated with darker skin color in the lower levels of socioeconomic status, independent of age, body mass index, and concentrations of blood glucose, serum urea nitrogen, serum uric acid, and urinary sodium and potassium.
 The association of skin color with blood pressure only in low socioeconomic strata may be due to the lesser ability of such groups to deal with the psychosocial stress associated with darker skin color.
 However, these findings also are consistent with an interaction between an environmental factor associated with low socioeconomic status and a susceptible gene that has a higher prevalence in persons with darker skin color.

 Patients were not advised to change diet, smoking habit, or life-style during the study.
 Twenty-one percent were cigarette smokers, and concurrent diabetes was present in 2.3%.
 Baseline blood cholesterol exceeded 200 mg/dl (5.2 mmol/L) in 90% and 250 mg/dl (6.5 mmol/L) in 56% of patients.
 The mean decrease in blood pressure produced by doxazosin was 22/15 mm Hg after 10 weeks of therapy; there was a mean decrease in heart rate of 1 beat/min.

 None of the patients had neck nodes and/or metastases, and each had 5-year follow-up.
 The tumors were staged according to the 1983 and 1988 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging systems for maxillary sinus cancers.
 There were 13 early stage (T1, T2) and 38 advanced (T3, T4) tumors in both systems.
 Cox regression analyses of survival curves showed increasingly worse prognoses for advanced tumors in both T-staging systems.
 Further analyses showed a significant difference in survival between T3 and T4 in the 1988, but not in the 1983 system.
 There were no significant differences in survival according to treatment modality or histological type of malignancy.
 We conclude that the 1988 system prognosticates successfully for T-stage (1 to 4) and demonstrates significant improvement in detecting T3 versus T4 differences compared to the 1983 system.
 The 1988 system applies equally for epidermoid cancer and other malignancies of the antrum.

 In the present study we investigated whether basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) plays a role in the proliferative response of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to denuding injury.
 Rat carotid smooth muscle was found to express the mRNA for bFGF, and bFGF protein was found to be present in rat aorta by immunoblot analysis.
 Systemically administered bFGF was a potent mitogen for vascular SMCs in arteries denuded with a balloon catheter, increasing replication from 11.5% in controls to 54.8%.
 Denudation with a device (filament loop), which causes only minimal damage to medial SMCs, showed a similar increase in replication (1.3% versus 43.3%) after bFGF infusion.
 In unmanipulated vessels, however, SMCs were unresponsive to infused bFGF.
 Infusion of a ""mitotoxin"" (bFGF conjugated to saporin) caused a greater than 50% decrease in the number of viable SMCs in the arterial wall after balloon injury.
 Prolonged administration of bFGF (12 micrograms/day for 2 weeks) after balloon injury caused an approximately twofold increase in intimal thickening.
 These results show that bFGF, which is synthesized by the arterial wall, could be a potent mitogen for SMCs in vivo and suggest that any release of endogenous bFGF may be capable of stimulating SMC proliferation, which may subsequently lead to intimal lesion formation.

 Patients were followed for a minimum of 3 years.
 The groups, which were matched for patient age and implant size, were evaluated at 3, 12, 24, and 36 months for capsular contracture, steroid atrophy, and other complications.
 With completion of the double-blind study, the patients with submuscular gel-saline implants with only saline added had an overall capsular contracture rate of 38 percent at 3 months, 38 percent at 12 months, and 44 percent at 24 and 36 months.

 'Very late antigen' (VLA) proteins are members of the integrin superfamily with cell-surface receptor function and are involved in the cell-cell matrix interaction.
 They are heterodimers with a common beta 1 chain and different alpha chains counted through VLA-1 to VLA-6.
 The VLA-2 complex (alpha 2/beta 1) was found to act as collagen receptor on platelets and the VLA-6 complex (alpha 6/beta 1) as laminin receptor.
 Using monoclonal antibodies and an indirect immunoperoxidase method, we investigated the expression of VLA-alpha 2, VLA-alpha 6, and VLA-beta 1 chains in 20 normal colonic mucosa samples, in 20 colonic adenomas, and in 96 carcinomas together with 10 accompanying liver metastases.
 All three proteins were expressed throughout the colonic epithelium, except for VLA-alpha 2, which was present in the cryptic gland but was absent on the mucosal surface in some cases.
 In general, adenomas were strongly positive for the VLA proteins but 3 of 20 cases showed focal VLA-alpha 2-negative areas.
 The carcinomas revealed considerable heterogeneity of VLA-alpha 2 expression; ie, 59 tumors were completely positive, 35 tumors revealed a focal loss of antigen, and 2 cases were negative.
 This reduced antigen expression was statistically associated with Dukes' stage C/D (P = 0.003).
 VLA-alpha 6 was expressed throughout in all tumors.
 VLA-beta 1 was found extensively expressed in 77 carcinomas, partially expressed in 17 carcinomas, and was absent in 2 carcinomas.
 As compared to their primary tumors, liver metastases showed roughly corresponding patterns of antigen expression.

2133,"Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia in the etiology and clinical course of hypertension.
 Patients with untreated hypertension have been shown to be resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and are more hyperinsulinemic and hypertriglyceridemic than matched groups of patients with normal blood pressure.
 In addition, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been demonstrated in spontaneous hypertensive rats and in Sprague-Dawley rats fed a fructose-enriched diet.
 The defect in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in these experimental models can also be shown at the cellular level.
 Experimental interventions that prevent insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia from developing in fructose-fed rats also greatly attenuate the increase in blood pressure.
 Since endogenous hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia have been identified as factors that increase the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), it is likely that they contribute to the increased prevalence of CAD in hypertensive patients.
 Antihypertensive treatment may have exacerbated these metabolic abnormalities, which could help explain why it has been difficult to show that lowering blood pressure decreases the risk of CAD.
 These observations raise the possibility that abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism may play a role in both the etiology and clinical course of hypertension.

 We tested the usefulness of a sustained intravenous infusion of nifedipine and a combination of nifedipine and metoprolol in the early management of 14 patients with unstable angina pectoris.
 After a 24-hour run-in period, nifedipine was titrated in a stepwise fashion (mean dose 27 +/- 7 micrograms/min).
 After nifedipine treatment coronary blood flow increased from 150 +/- 66 to 183 +/- 74 ml/min (p less than 0.05), whereas double product, myocardial oxygen consumption, and both arterial and coronary sinus (nor)epinephrine levels were unchanged.
 Myocardial lactate uptake increased from 3.4 +/- 26.1 to 31.3 +/- 26.6 mumol/min (p less than 0.005) and free fatty acid uptake from 7.2 +/- 22.1 to 34.5 +/- 33.7 mumol/min (p less than 0.05).
 A small nonsignificant improvement in amino acid metabolism was observed.
 Metoprolol was added in seven patients and led to a decrease in double product (-2.2 +/- 1.6 x 10(3); p less than 0.01) and myocardial oxygen consumption (-3.2 +/- 3.8 ml/min; p less than 0.05).
 The lactate uptake/oxygen uptake ratio increased by 18% after metoprolol (p = NS).
 The number of episodes of chest pain decreased from 2.4 +/- 1.1/24 hours to 0.1 +/- 0.2 in the nifedipine group and from 2.9 +/- 1.1/24 hours to 0.3 +/- 0.5 in the nifedipine plus metoprolol group (both p less than 0.01).
 We conclude that in the acute phase of unstable angina, intravenous nifedipine can be carefully titrated to improve coronary blood flow and oxidative metabolism.
 The addition of metoprolol is also associated with a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand.

2136,"Effect of systemic medetomidine, an alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist, on experimental pain in humans.
 The effect of systemic (intravenous) medetomidine, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, on pain thresholds was studied in healthy human subjects (n = 6).
 Medetomidine produced a dose-dependent (cumulative doses: 25 and 50 micrograms) sedative effect evaluated by visual analog scale.
 Also, a dose-dependent decrease of blood pressure but not of heart rate was seen after administration of medetomidine.
 Pain threshold to electric stimulation of the tooth pulp and cutaneous heat pain threshold were uninfluenced by medetomidine.
 An index of cutaneous thermal sensitivity to innocuous stimuli, the width of the thermoneutral zone, also was uninfluenced by medetomidine.
 Medetomidine produced a significant attenuation of the affective-motivational component (unpleasantness) of tourniquet-induced ischemic pain, whereas the sensory-discriminative component (pain magnitude estimate) of the ischemic pain was not attenuated.
 The results suggest that systemic medetomidine alone at subanesthetic but sedative and hypotensive doses does not significantly influence the intensity and thresholds of experimental pain, whereas the affective-motivational component of pain can be attenuated.

 We report a prospective, controlled study of the effects of the reduction and discontinuation of phenytoin (PHT) (22 patients), carbamazepine (CBZ) (23 patients), and valproate (VPA) (25 patients) with concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
 The principal changes in the serum concentrations of concomitant AEDs were (a) phenobarbital (PB) concentrations decreased by a mean of 30% on discontinuation of PHT; (b) total CBZ concentrations increased by a mean of 48% and free CBZ concentrations increased by a mean of 30% on discontinuation of PHT, with no change in CBZ-10, 11-epoxide (CBZ-E) concentrations; (c) VPA concentrations increased by a mean of 19% on discontinuation of PHT; (d) VPA concentrations increased by a mean of 42% on discontinuation of CBZ; (e) ethosuximide (ESM) concentrations increased by a mean of 48% on discontinuation of CBZ; (f) PHT concentrations decreased by a mean of 26% on discontinuation of CBZ; (g) PHT free fraction decreased from a mean of 0.11 to 0.07 on discontinuation of VPA; and (h) the mean concentrations of total and free CBZ increased by a mean of 10 and 16%, respectively, on VPA discontinuation, with a concomitant mean 24% decrease in total CBZ-E and a 22% decrease in free CBZ-E.
 Apart from the decrease in PB concentrations on PHT discontinuation, all significant changes had occurred by 1 week after the end of AED discontinuation.
 The implication for clinical practice is that a serum AED concentration at this time reflects the new steady state.
 Free concentrations did not add any clinically useful information to that gained from analysis of total serum concentrations.

 The disturbance of visual perception associated with nystagmus is a rare phenomenon.
 This is a case of a 61-year-old woman who developed progressive right hemisensory deficit, left facial sensory deficit, vertigo, staggering to the left, left ptosis, vertical diplopia, and ataxia of the left upper extremity.
 She had rotatory nystagmus in primary position, which increased in amplitude with left gaze.
 The above signs and symptoms were consistent with lateral medullary syndrome.
 During her rehabilitation, the patient complained of visual disturbances typical of oscillopsia.
 These disturbances, or illusions, are compensatory mechanisms for nystagmus and its resultant retinal error.
 The purpose of this case presentation was to study the pathophysiology underlying oscillopsia in patients with nystagmus and to stimulate awareness of such visual disturbances in stroke patients.

 We sought evidence of oxidant-induced biological membrane damage in 43 resuscitated blunt trauma patients (average ISS, 36.9) within 2-6 hours of injury and before anaesthesia and surgery.
 The plasma levels of the lipid peroxidation products (conjugated dienes, CDs A 233 nm) and malondialdehyde (MDA, nMol/ml) and the oxidant-inducing effect of the trauma plasma on normal FMLP-stimulated neutrophils were compared to those of control subjects.
 No differences were observed in the plasma levels of MDA (1.73 +/- 2.15 vs.

 To study the histopathologic changes of spinal cords exposed to long-duration complete ischemia, the authors developed an upper-half-body transplantation model of inbred rat.
 In this model, an infant Lewis rat is transplanted to the inguinal region of another adult Lewis rat using microsurgical vascular anastomosis.
 Even when 2-week-old donor rats were exposed to complete ischemia for 90 minutes, functions of the spinal cord were comparatively preserved.
 In histopathologic observations, degeneration proportional to complete ischemia duration was noted.
 In the 60-minute ischemia group of 2-week-old donor rats, however, no substantial differences from normal spinal cord were observed.
 Under conditions of equal ischemia duration, it appeared the younger animal had the greater ischemic tolerance.

 The 1987 National Vital Statistics System and the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1982 through 1984) were used to assess the health status of Mexican-American, mainland Puerto Rican, and Cuban-American children by examining the prevalences of pregnancy outcomes and chronic medical conditions.
 The low-birth-weight rate among Hispanics (7.0%) compared favorably with that of non-Hispanic whites (7.1%) despite the greater poverty and lower levels of education among Hispanics.
 When examined by Hispanic subgroup, however, significant differences were present, with mainland Puerto Ricans having the highest prevalences of low-birth-weight infants.
 Premature births were more common among all three Hispanic subgroups than among non-Hispanic whites.
 Mexican-American and Cuban-American children had a similar prevalence of (3.9% and 2.5%, respectively) chronic medical conditions compared with non-Hispanic white children; Puerto Rican children had a higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions (6.2%).
 When assessed by these health status indicators, Hispanic children seem to have a health status similar to non-Hispanic white children.
 However, mainland Puerto Rican children seem at greater risk for poor health, reflecting the US Hispanic population's heterogeneity.
 Health programs targeted at US Hispanics should appropriately consider these group differences.

 A full-length cDNA clone encoding 12-lipoxygenase (arachidonate:oxygen 12-oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.11.31) was isolated from a human platelet cDNA library by using a cDNA for human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase as probe for the initial screening.
 The cDNA had an open reading frame encoding 662 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 75,590.
 Three independent clones revealed minor heterogeneities in their DNA sequences.
 Thus, in three positions of the deduced amino acid sequence, there is a choice between two different amino acids.
 The deduced sequence from the clone plT3 showed 65% identity with human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase and 42% identity with human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase.
 The 12-lipoxygenase cDNA recognized a 3.0-kilobase mRNA species in platelets and human erythroleukemia cells (HEL cells).
 Phorbol 12-tetradecanoyl 13-acetate induced megakaryocytic differentiation of HEL cells and 12-lipoxygenase activity and increased mRNA for 12-lipoxygenase.

 Spontaneous contrast in the left ventricle is an unusual entity.
 We retrospectively studied 16 patients who were found to have spontaneous contrast present on two-dimensional echocardiograms, specifically noting their clinical characteristics, the reproducibility of this phenomenon, the presence of thrombi and embolic events, and prognostic implications.
 Diagnoses included ischemic heart disease in nine patients, dilated cardiomyopathy in six patients, and hypertensive cardiomyopathy in one patient.
 The mean ejection fraction was 17.6%.
 There were six thromboembolic events in four patients.
 The spontaneous contrast was reproducible for periods of time up to 39 months.
 Patients who had improvement in their left ventricular dysfunction or who underwent aneurysmectomy had disappearance of the spontaneous contrast.
 Those patients who had spontaneous contrast reproduced on subsequent echocardiograms did not seem to have a worse prognosis than patients with similarly depressed ventricular function, but a larger study is necessary to verify this.

 The APACHE II Score was used to stratify retrospectively severity of illness in 91 patients postoperatively undergoing drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses.
 The method of initial abscess drainage (percutaneous or operative) was selected by the attending physician.
 The two groups of patients, those whose initial drainage was performed percutaneously versus operatively were similar with respect to age, sex, abscess location and, most importantly, severity of illness as assessed by the APACHE II score calculated on the day of their abscess drainage.
 Over-all, the mortality rate was 29 per cent (26 of 91 patients).
 Only 1.7 per cent of the patients with an APACHE II score of less than 15 died compared with 78 per cent when APACHE II was equal to or more than 15 (p less than 0.0001).
 Only 8 per cent of patients with APACHE II equal to or more than 15 undergoing percutaneous drainage survived compared with 30 per cent of patients who underwent surgical drainage procedures.
 While chi-square analysis demonstrated independence between outcome and drainage technique, outcome was dependent upon severity of illness (p less than 0.0005).
 Paradoxically, despite the attractiveness of a percutaneous technique for abscess drainage in the most ill patients, in this series, a better, although not statistically improved, chance for survival was noted with surgical treatment.
 We recommend that an objective severity scoring system be used whenever assessing results of treatment of intraabdominal infection and that surgical treatment not be avoided because the patient is considered to be too ill.

 O2 toxicity of the central nervous system (CNS) may be a result of enhanced generation of reactive O2 species such as superoxide and H2O2 at high PO2.
 In this study, we measured H2O2 production in six regions of the rat brain before and after convulsions induced by hyperbaric hyperoxia (HBO).
 H2O2 concentration was determined ex vivo using a method based on the H2O2-dependent decline in catalase activity in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor of compound I, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole.
 Regional catalase activity in the brain ranged from 0.029 +/- 0.004 to 0.055 +/- 0.004 mumol O2.min-1.micrograms DNA-1 in cerebellum and medulla-pons, respectively.
 In the presence of aminotriazole, catalase activity declined after HBO-induced convulsions to 26-45% of normoxic values.
 The rates of inactivation of catalase were used to predict average steady-state values for H2O2 concentration in different brain structures.
 Estimated H2O2 concentrations during HBO varied from 31 to 51 pM in cerebellum and posterior subcortex and represented increases of 2.2-7.3 times normoxic values.
 These findings suggest that H2O2 is an important mediator of selective neuronal vulnerability to CNS O2 toxicity.

 The immediate reproducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia induction was evaluated prospectively during 106 studies performed in 53 patients with clinical sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.
 Programmed electrical stimulation was performed twice, using the same protocol during 53 drug-free studies and 53 subsequent studies on antiarrhythmic therapy.
 Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was reproduced in 104 (98%) of the 106 studies.
 There was no significant difference in the incidence of reproducible tachycardia in the drug-free state compared with that observed during treatment with different classes of antiarrhythmic drugs.
 An increase in the number of extrastimuli was required to reinitiate the tachycardia in 9 (11%) of 83 studies in which single or double extrastimuli were initially required to induce the tachycardia.
 In 39 (37%) of 104 studies with reproducible tachycardia induction, the two tachycardias significantly differed in electrocardiographic (ECG) configuration and cycle length.
 These observations suggest that the overall reproducibility of ventricular tachycardia induction is sufficiently high to provide a reliable marker for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.
 However, specific tachycardia characteristics such as cycle length and ECG configuration are more variable even within the same study and may be less useful in assessing the effects of subsequent interventions.

 The effects of captopril and placebo were compared in 18 patients with chronic heart failure and angina pectoris with use of a double-blind crossover trial design.
 Symptoms were assessed by patient treatment preference, visual analogue scores and nitroglycerin consumption.
 Exercise performance was assessed using two different treadmill protocols of different work intensity with simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and by supine bicycle exercise and simultaneous radionuclide ventriculography.
 Arrhythmias were assessed by 48 h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring.
 Patients generally preferred placebo to captopril, and this appeared to be due to an increase in symptoms of angina with captopril.
 Treadmill exercise time on a high intensity protocol was shorter with captopril than with placebo; on a low intensity protocol, angina became a more frequent limiting symptom even though overall exercise performance was not changed.
 The heart rate-blood pressure product was reduced, but largely because of a reduction in blood pressure rather than in heart rate.
 During supine bicycle exercise, no differences in symptoms, exercise performance, ejection fraction or changes in blood pressure were noted and ventricular arrhythmias were reduced.
 Captopril does not appear to be clinically useful in alleviating angina pectoris in patients with heart failure, and this effect may be related to a decrease in coronary perfusion pressure.
 Nonetheless, desirable metabolic effects, a reduction in arrhythmias and potential effects on survival require further study of captopril in patients with both angina and heart failure.

 Intramolecularly (alpha-alpha) cross-linked hemoglobin has been reported to have oxygen transport properties similar to those of whole blood.
 The present study evaluated the efficacy of diaspirin alpha-alpha cross-linked hemoglobin solution as a resuscitation fluid, with heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and transcutaneous oxygen tension as the study parameters.
 Rats were bled and approximately one third of their total blood volume (20 ml/kg) was removed while they were anesthetized; they were then resuscitated with 14% hemoglobin solution.
 Animals that received either 10 mg/kg (n = 10) or 20 mg/kg (n = 10) of hemoglobin solution responded quickly and positively to the infusions: mean arterial pressure (which had dropped to less than 40% of prehemorrhage levels) returned to baseline within 2 minutes of initiating infusion; by 4 minutes, the mean arterial pressures of the hemoglobin-infused groups were significantly higher (p less than or equal to 0.05) than those in both the autologous shed blood (n = 8) and lactated Ringer's (n = 10) groups.
 The heart rate and transcutaneous oxygen tension responses in both the half-volume and full-volume replacement hemoglobin groups matched the response to autologous shed blood throughout the hour of observation.
 The favorable hemodynamic response to infusion of cross-linked hemoglobin solution after hemorrhage suggests that this material is comparable to autologous shed blood and superior to lactated Ringer's solution as a resuscitative fluid as assessed in this model.

2155,"Progress and challenges in psychosocial and behavioral research in cancer in the twentieth century.
 Research in the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of cancer has shown steady growth since the 1950s, and its course of development has paralleled the history of medical techniques in treating cancer.
 Table 1 outlines this parallel evolution from the 1850s to the 1960s.
 The roles of the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in spearheading and nurturing research in this area are documented.
 Interest in psychooncologic questions can be traced back for centuries to the search for etiologic factors and psychologic variables that would explain individual vulnerability to cancer.
 The first psychologic studies of cancer patients were reported in 1951 and 1952 from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, respectively.
 The 1970s saw new interest in psychosocial and behavioral research with many issues being addressed for the first time: better care of the terminally ill through more humanistic approaches including better means of pain control; ethical concerns related to patient rights and their status as subjects in experimental protocols; trying to measure quality of life for cancer patients on protocols; seeing the need for multidisciplinary collaborative groups to make up for the absence of formal training in this area; and the need to design valid, accurate measuring scales specific to the symptomology of patients with cancer.
 Table 4 outlines how the 1980s gave increasing recognition and support to the psychosocial dimensions of cancer.
 This period produced a series of key conferences that examined a broad research and education perspective and produced recommendations that remain a benchmark in regard to instrumentation, conceptual models, pitfalls of psychosocial research, training, and education, and the organization of research efforts.
 New precision has been added to the field in the past 6 years: studies measuring concurrent psychologic, endocrine, and immune function; use of statistical modeling to incorporate quality of life data as a correction factor in survival data (TWiST and QALY); and broadened definitions of medical outcome to include functional status, thus allowing advances in psychiatric measurements to help answer questions in cancer.
 The challenges for the 1990s are identified in a summary in Table 9.
 Especially noteworthy is the observation that the comprehensive research needed today cannot be carried out by any one discipline alone.
 New approaches call for areas of the social sciences formerly inactive in cancer research (e.g., anthropology) to contribute the tools and expertise required to address the problems.

 We conducted a pilot protocol at seven Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) institutions to examine the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of using a common regimen of high-dose chemoradiotherapy (HD CT/RT) supported by autologous or allogeneic marrow infusions in children with metastatic neuroblastoma (NBL) in first or second remission.
 During a 57-month period, we accrued 101 patients.
 We report here results for the 81 who completed treatment at least 2 years ago.
 The HD CT/RT regimen consisted of melphalan 60 mg/m2/d for three doses, and total body irradiation (TBI) either 1.5 Gy (n = 27) or 2.0 Gy (n = 54) twice daily for six doses.
 Twenty-three patients also received irradiation consisting of 1.2 Gy twice daily for 10 doses to persisting disease sites.
 Seventy-four were given autologous and seven allogeneic marrow, 64 autologous marrows being purged immunomagnetically.
 Fifty-four children were in first complete (CR) or partial (PR) remission and 27 in second CR or PR.
 As of October 1, 1990, follow-up was from 32 to 72 months.
 Forty-seven of these 81 children relapsed, 10 died of complications, one of unknown cause, and 23 continue in remission, including 21 of the 54 treated in first remission, and 16 who completed treatment more than 3 years ago.
 The 2-year actuarial event-free survival (EFS) probabilities are first CR (CR1) 32% (SE 10%), first PR (PR1) 43% (SE 9%), second CR (CR2) 33% (SE 27%), and second PR (PR2) 5% (SE 5%).
 Probability of EFS correlated with remission number (first better than second, P less than .001), with interval from diagnosis to HD CT/RT (greater than 9 months better than less than 9 months, P = .055), and with TBI dose (12 Gy better than 9 Gy, P = .031).
 These encouraging results may partly reflect selection for this treatment of patients with NBL who have a slower disease pace.

 We recorded two-dimensional echocardiograms simultaneously with the respiration measurements of 20 normal subjects and 20 patients with anterior myocardial infarction.
 The apical long-axis and four-chamber views were quantitatively analyzed.
 Measurement variability of global ejection fraction and regional ejection fraction of 100 regions was calculated during inspiration and at end-expiration for two observers.
 To minimize variability, the endocardial contour was redefined and traced with an improved computer-assisted tracing system.
 Variability (absolute mean difference) between two beats at end-expiration was significantly less than during inspiration (p less than 0.05): for ejection fraction the variability at end-expiration was 3.4% and the variability during inspiration was 6.4% (mean, 54%; SD, 7%); for regional ejection fraction the variability at end-expiration was 11.8% and the variability during inspiration was 21.5% (mean, 56%; SD, 15%).
 Intraobserver and interobserver variability values of one beat at end-expiration for ejection fraction were 3.1% and 3.8%, respectively, and 9.5% and 12.8%, respectively, for regional ejection fraction.
 Variability in patients with myocardial infarction was comparable.
 This method of recording respiration and analyzing left ventricular function at end-expiration, with a new contour definition and tracing system, provides a measurement variability that is considerably less than that reported in previous echocardiographic studies and that is comparable to angiographic methods.

 Etoposide is an important chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of selected patients with germ cell tumors, lymphomas, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
 Its optimal use is continuing to evolve.
 It is clear that schedule dependency is of critical importance.
 Recently, preliminary studies have suggested that a prolonged schedule of etoposide administration (21 days) may be more effective than the standard 3- to 5-day schedule.
 Results of several Phase II studies show chronic oral etoposide administration induces occasional responses in resistant tumors and higher-than-expected response rates in patients with germ cell tumors and SCLC.
 Preliminary data show nearly 90% etoposide absorption when given in a low-dose schedule (50 mg/m2/d) for 21 days.
 These observations indicate that etoposide may be a ""new drug"" when given in the chronic schedule.
 Further exploration of the schedule dependency of etoposide is indicated.
 Etoposide has recently been proven useful in selected patients with gastric, ovarian, and poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary site.
 Several other drugs are either synergistic or additive and will be explored in combination chemotherapy.

2163,"An alternative oxygen delivery system for infants and children in the post-anaesthesia care unit.
 This randomized controlled trial compared the compliance of a blow-by oxygen method with the standard face mask by children recovering from anaesthesia.
 The rate at which a face mask was rejected when applied to infants and children in PACU was compared with that of a proposed ""hose"" method.
 The efficacy of the ""hose"" as a method of oxygen supplementation in children at low and high risk for developing postoperative hypoxaemia was also compared with the face mask.
 Using a Nellcor N-200 pulse oximeter, 66 infants and children (mean age 2.3 yr, range 2 mo-6 yr) were continuously monitored for 30 min upon arrival in the PACU.
 Patients were randomized to receive oxygen supplementation with either the face mask or the proposed ""hose"" method.
 The results showed a greater than 80 per cent rejection of the face mask in contrast to 100 per cent compliance with the ""hose"" method.
 The SaO2 measurements following 5, 15 and 30 min of O2 supplementation with the hose were all significantly higher than the SaO2 measurements obtained on room air upon arrival to the PACU.
 Patients with pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease had a 20 per cent incidence of arterial oxygen desaturation upon arrival to the PACU versus 2.1 per cent of patients with no pre-existing disease.
 It is concluded that the ""hose"" is associated with high patient compliance and is effective in the PACU in increasing the SaO2 in children at low or high risk of developing postoperative hypoxaemia.

2164,"Sleep disturbances in survivors of the Nazi Holocaust.
 OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: Sleep disturbances are commonly reported by victims of extraordinary stress and can persist for decades.
 This study was designed to test the hypothesis that survivors of the Nazi Holocaust would have significantly more and different sleep problems than depressed and healthy comparison subjects and that the severity of the survivors' problems would be correlated with length of time spent in a concentration camp.
 Forty-two survivors, 37 depressed patients, and 54 healthy subjects of about the same age, all living in the community, described their sleep patterns over the preceding month on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a self-rating instrument that inquires about quality, latency, duration, efficiency, and disturbances of sleep, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction.
 RESULTS: The survivors had significantly greater sleep impairment than the healthy comparison subjects, as measured by all subscales of the index, but had less impairment than the depressed patients except on the sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction subscales.
 However, for specific items within these subscales, survivors had significantly more frequent awakenings due to bad dreams and had less loss of enthusiasm than the depressed subjects.
 Sleep disturbances and frequency of nightmares were significantly and positively correlated with the duration of the survivors' internment in concentration camps.
 CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that for some Holocaust survivors, impaired sleep and frequent nightmares are considerable problems even 45 years after liberation.

2165,"Relation of left ventricular mass and geometry to morbidity and mortality in uncomplicated essential hypertension.
 OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic significance of left ventricular mass and geometry in initially healthy persons with essential hypertension.
 DESIGN: An observational study of a prospectively identified cohort.
 SETTING: University medical center.
 PATIENTS: Two hundred and eighty patients with essential hypertension and no pre-existing cardiac disease were evaluated using echocardiography between 1976 and 1981.
 Two hundred and fifty-three subjects or their family members (90%) were contacted for a follow-up interview an average of 10.2 years after the initial echocardiogram was obtained; the survival status of 27 patients lost to follow-up was ascertained using National Death Index data.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Left ventricular mass exceeded 125 g/m2 in 69 of 253 patients (27%).
 Cardiovascular events occurred in a higher proportion of patients with than without left ventricular hypertrophy (26% compared with 12%; P = 0.006).
 Patients with increased ventricular mass were also at higher risk for cardiovascular death (14% compared with 0.5%; P less than 0.001) and all-cause mortality (16% compared with 2%; P = 0.001).
 Electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy did not predict risk.
 Patients with normal left ventricular geometry had the fewest adverse outcomes (no cardiac deaths; morbid events in 11%), and those with concentric hypertrophy had the most (death in 21%; morbid events in 31%).
 In a multivariate analysis, only age and left ventricular mass--but not gender, blood pressure, or serum cholesterol level--independently predicted all three outcome measures.
 CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass and geometry stratify risk in patients with essential hypertension independently of and more strongly than blood pressure or other potentially reversible risk factors and may help to stratify the need for intensive treatment.

2166,"Prosthetic valves in children and adolescents.
 The purpose of this paper is to present the short- and long-term results of prosthetic valve replacement in children.
 During a 7-year period that ended in April 1985, 186 children, ages 1 to 20 years, underwent valve replacement; there were 55 (30%) aortic valve replacements, 95 (51%) mitral valve replacements, and 36 (19%) multiple valve replacements.
 Ninety-four percent of the lesions were rheumatic in origin, 4% were congenital, and 2% were infectious.
 Of 223 valves replaced, 175 (78%) were mechanical valves and 48 (22%) were heterografts; the latter were in the mitral position in all but three patients.
 Surgical mortality rates were 3.6%, 4.2%, and 19.4% respectively for aortic valve, mitral valve, and multiple valve replacements.
 Five-year actuarial survival was 91% for aortic valve replacement, 82% for mitral valve replacement and 60% for multiple valve replacement.
 Major events included reoperation in 34 (with three deaths), progressive myocardial failure that led to death in 10, sudden unexpected death in two, thromboembolic complications in 19 (death in five), subacute bacterial endocarditis in five (two deaths), and bleeding that required transfusion in two patients.
 Five-year complication-free actuarial survival rates were 83% for aortic valve replacement, 63% for mitral valve replacement, and 57% for multiple valve replacement.
 The respective five-year complication-free survival rates were 83%, 48%, and 43%.
 Significant morbidity and mortality rates are associated with valve replacement.
 Therefore every effort should be made to preserve the native valve by plastic reparative procedures.
 When prosthetic replacement of mitral valve is contemplated, our data would suggest that heterografts should not be inserted in children 15 years of age or younger, although heterografts may be used in children over 15 years of age with the expectation of valve survival comparable to that of mechanical valves.
 When complications that are associated with anticoagulant therapy were reviewed, platelet inhibiting drugs seem quite satisfactory in patients with aortic valve replacement; patients with mitral valve replacement seem to require warfarin therapy, and warfarin must be used in patients with multiple valve replacement to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications.

 This epidemiologic study represents an analysis of all registered new cases of osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) during the 14-year period from January 1973 to December 1986 in five San Francisco Bay counties.
 Inclusion into the study was limited to patients who were diagnosed in the first three decades of life and who were residents within the Bay Area at the time of diagnosis.
 To determine epidemiologic characteristics of OGS, records on 96 patients from the Bay Area Resources for Cancer Control with histologically proven OGS were reviewed.
 The incidence of OGS was influenced by age, gender, and race, but none of the effects were statistically significant.
 A geographic variation in the incidence of OGS was discovered, although it was not statistically significant.
 The results are presented in support of a continued search for environmental variables that may someday reveal the etiologic factors of OGS.

2172,"Impairment of the myocardial ultrastructure and changes of the cytoskeleton in dilated cardiomyopathy.
 This study was designed to determine the morphological correlate of chronic heart failure.
 Myocardial tissue from eight patients undergoing transplantation surgery because of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy was investigated by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against elements of the cytoskeleton: desmin, tubulin, vinculin, and vimentin.
 The tissue showed hypertrophy, atrophy of myocytes, and an increased amount of fibrosis.
 Ultrastructural changes consisted of enlargement and varying shape of nuclei, numerous very small mitochondria, proliferation of T tubules, and accumulation of lipid droplets and glycogen.
 The most obvious ultrastructural alteration was the decrease of myofilaments, ranging from rarefication to complete absence of sarcomeres in cells filled with unspecified cytoplasm.
 Immunocytochemistry showed that desmin was localized at the Z lines.
 In diseased myocardium, the amount of desmin was increased, but it was disorderly arranged.
 Tubulin formed a fine network throughout the myocytes and was significantly increased in cardiomyopathic hearts.
 Vinculin, a protein closely associated with the cytoskeleton, occurred not only at the sarcolemma and the intercalated disc but also within the myocardial cells.
 Ultrastructural changes and alterations of the cytoskeleton were severe in about one third of all cells.
 About one third of all cells showed moderately severe changes, and the remaining cells were normal.
 Vimentin was present in the interstitial cells and was increased in relation to the increase of fibrosis.
 We conclude that the increase of fibrosis, the degeneration of hypertrophied myocardial cells, and the alterations of the cytoskeleton are the morphological correlates of reduced myocardial function in chronic heart failure.

2173,"The axilla: not a no-go zone 
 Many surgeons, particularly in the UK, give inadequate primary treatment to patients with operable breast cancer.
 For spurious reasons they regard axillary clearance as unnecessarily extensive surgery and rely instead upon total mastectomy or tumour excision and node sampling, with or without postoperative radiotherapy.
 But it is now clear that relapse-free and overall survival can be improved by appropriate adjuvant therapy.
 Thus inadequate exploration of the axilla is doubly unjustified.
 Not only is there the obvious risk of failure to remove nodes that contain metastases--so that some patients are deprived of cure by primary treatment--but the extent of tumour spread will be inadequately assessed in many more patients, with the risk that they may not receive appropriate adjuvant treatment.

 The diagnostic accuracy of Doppler color flow imaging in the diagnosis of postinfarction ventricular septal defects has not been established.
 In this study, 43 patients with unexplained hypotension or a new murmur in the periinfarct period were evaluated with conventional two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler color flow imaging.
 The presence of a ventricular septal defect was confirmed by oximetry, ventriculography, operative repair, or autopsy in each case.
 Both two-dimensional and Doppler color flow imaging were 100% specific in excluding a ventricular septal defect.
 Doppler color flow imaging correctly identified the 12 confirmed ventricular septal defects in this study (100% sensitivity), whereas any combination of two-dimensional criteria only correctly identified seven (58% sensitive) (p less than 0.05).
 Doppler color flow imaging is superior to conventional two-dimensional imaging in the diagnosis of a postinfarction ventricular septal defect.
 In addition, Doppler color flow imaging localized the septal defect, and thus guided therapy and technique for repair.
 Carefully performed Doppler color flow examination can exclude or result in the rapid diagnosis of a ventricular septal defect, which eliminates the need for further time-consuming confirmatory testing.

2175,"Queuine, a tRNA anticodon wobble base, maintains the proliferative and pluripotent potential of HL-60 cells in the presence of the differentiating agent 6-thioguanine.
 6-Thioguanine (6-TG)-induced differentiation of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (IMP: pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.8)-deficient HL-60 cells is characterized by 2 days of growth, after which morphological differentiation proceeds.
 Addition of the tRNA wobble base queuine, in the presence of 6-TG, maintains the proliferative capability of the cells.
 The ability of 6-TG to induce differentiation correlates with c-myc mRNA down-regulation, but queuine has no effect on this parameter.
 Treatment with 6-TG for 2-3 days commits HL-60 cells to granulocytic differentiation, and, once committed, these cells do not respond to the monocytic inducer phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.
 Nonetheless, when cells are treated with queuine and 6-TG, they maintain the promyelocytic morphology and are capable of being induced down the monocytic pathway by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as indicated by stabilization of c-fms mRNA and cell adherence.
 In the absence of queuine, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is incapable of inducing monocytic markers in the 6-TG-treated cells.
 The data presented indicate that 6-TG-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is a tRNA-facilitated event and that the tRNA wobble base queuine is capable of maintaining both the proliferative and pluripotent potential of the cells.

 Long-term experience with totally implanted catheter systems (TICS) is limited.
 We retrospectively evaluated the performance and long-term complications of TICS for intravenous infusion in cancer patients; 134 systems were implanted in 128 patients.
 The median duration of implantation was 144 weeks with 49 systems implanted for more than one year.
 Complications related to surgical factors included malposition of reservoir (2%), skin perforation or wound dehiscence (1.5%) and pneumothorax (less than 1%).
 Complications not related to surgical factors included: drug extravasation (1.5%), mechanical malfunction (1.5%), vein thrombosis (less than 1%), clotting of the reservoir or catheter (2%), skin infection (1.5%), and sepsis (less than 1%).
 The total complication rate was 13%.
 Most complications resolved spontaneously or with medical treatment and only 6 patients (4.6%) required re-implantation of a second system.

 The relationship between parental alcoholism and risk for maladjustment in the offspring was investigated in a community sample.
 Children of parents who met criteria for DIS/DSM-III alcohol abuse or dependence and children of parents who met criteria for ten other diagnoses were compared to children of ""normal"" parents.
 The data were obtained from the merging of the data banks of two major psychiatric epidemiology studies of the adult (17-64) and child (4-16) population of Puerto Rico.
 Results indicated that parental alcoholism in addition to creating an adverse family environment had an effect on the relative risk for maladjustment in the offspring (as measured by scores on the Child Behavior Checklist).
 Although previous studies have reported higher levels of externalizing behaviors in children of alcoholics, an increased risk for internalizing symptoms was observed in the children studied.
 Similar findings were obtained for the children of parents with other psychiatric disorders suggesting that the effects of parental alcoholism in children ages 4 to 16 may not be different from the consequences of parental mental illness per se.

 To assess the relation of lipid levels to angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD), lipid profiles were obtained on 125 men and 72 women undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography.
 CAD, defined as greater than or equal to 25% diameter narrowing in a major coronary artery, was present in 106 men (85%) and 54 women (75%).
 Multiple regression analyses revealed that only high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level in men, and age and total/HDL cholesterol ratio in women, were independently associated with the presence of CAD after adjustment for other risk factors.
 HDL cholesterol level and age were significantly correlated with both extent (number of diseased vessels) and severity (percent maximum stenosis) of CAD in men.
 In women, age was the only independent variable related to severity, whereas age and total/HDL cholesterol ratio were related to extent.
 Of 71 patients with total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dl, 79% had CAD.
 With multiple regression analyses, HDL cholesterol was the only variable independently related to the presence and severity of CAD in these patients after adjustment for age and gender; extent was significantly associated with age and male gender, and was unrelated to any of the lipid parameters.
 With use of multiple logistic and linear regression analyses of the group of 197 patients, HDL cholesterol was the most powerful independent variable associated with the presence and severity of CAD after adjustment for age and gender.
 HDL cholesterol was also an independent predictor of extent.
 Age was independently associated with each of the end points examined, and was the variable most significantly related to extent.
 These data add to the growing body of information demonstrating an important association between HDL and CAD.

2182,"Regression of atherosclerosis: what does it mean?
 Angiographic evidence of coronary artery atherosclerosis regression has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials.
 The significance of this regression appears to depend in a complex way on the degree of atherosclerosis present when a regression regimen is initiated.
 Angiographic trials indicate that lesion change is a continuum, with a gradual transition from progression to stability and regression.
 Divergent lesion change can be seen in the same patient with a progression of some lesions and a regression of others.
 This makes it necessary to perform a comprehensive survey of all visible coronary segments when evaluating angiograms to determine the outcome of a clinical trial.
 An important finding in clinical trials is that new lesion formation can be reduced.
 This indicates that effective control of atherosclerosis may be possible with procedures now available, but noninvasive coronary artery imaging methods need to be refined.

 OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to 1) determine substance abuse prevalence and preference in a diverse sample of schizophrenic, schizoaffective, and schizophreniform inpatients, 2) compare drug-abusing and non-drug-abusing patients on demographic and clinical variables during the acute and stabilization phases of their hospital course, and 3) obtain data from patients on reasons for drug abuse and on acute state-related changes during periods of intoxication.
 METHOD: Eighty-three psychotic inpatients consecutively admitted to a New York City teaching hospital were evaluated.
 Sixty-eight had schizophrenia, 12 had schizoaffective disorder, and three had schizophreniform disorder diagnosed according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R.
 Each patient received ratings on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Global Assessment Scale, and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms at admission and at discharge, an evaluation of premorbid adjustment, and an extensive interview on drug and alcohol use.
 RESULTS: Forty (48%) of the patients received diagnoses of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence.
 The drug-abusing patients primarily used cannabis (N = 26), alcohol (N = 21), and cocaine (N = 14) and reported that they abused drugs to get ""high,"" to relieve depression, and to relax.
 They had significantly fewer positive and negative symptoms at discharge, better sexual adjustment and worse school performance during adolescence, and more family histories of drug abuse than the non-drug-abusing patients.

 The ratio of ankle-to-arm systolic blood pressure (ankle/arm index or AAI) appears to be a non-invasive indicator of flow-significant atherosclerosis and may be a useful measure of burden of disease in a high risk population.
 The prevalence of lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) was assessed by this method in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP).
 Subjects were aged 60 and older with systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg upon entry to the study.
 An AAI of 0.90 or less was considered indicative of flow-significant LEAD.
 The prevalence of LEAD by this method was 26.7% (50/187), while the prevalence of intermittent claudication (IC) was only 6.4% (12/187).
 Of those with IC, 66.7% (8/12) had confirmed LEAD.
 The prevalence of LEAD as measured by AAI increased with age in women and was associated with a history of current smoking and lower levels of high density lipoproteins.
 In this study population with systolic hypertension, LEAD, as measured by the AAI, is more prevalent than previously described in elderly populations and is associated with other risk factors for atherosclerosis.

 The effect of various Ca++ antagonists and local anesthetics on neuronal cell degeneration induced by veratridine was studied in primary rat brain neuronal cultures.
 Cell death was quantified by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released in the culture medium.
 The neuronal cell degeneration was Ca+(+)-dependent because, in the absence of extracellular Ca++, 16 hr of exposure to 30 microM veratridine failed to produce release of LDH.
 Ca++ antagonists, nonselective for slow Ca++ channels (flunarizine, cinnarizine, lidoflazine, prenylamine and bepridil) inhibited veratridine-induced release of LDH with IC50 values between 0.11 and 0.47 microM.
 Ca++ antagonists selective for slow Ca++ channels were less potent and inhibited veratridine-induced release of LDH at concentrations in the following order of potency: nicardipine greater than gallopamil and verapamil greater than niludipine greater than nitrendipine greater than nifedipine greater than nimodipine greater than diltiazem.
 Tested local anesthetics were incomplete inhibitors of veratridine-induced release of LDH.
 A good correlation was found between the potency of the drugs to inhibit released LDH induced by 30 microM veratridine in neuronal cultures and their binding affinity for the batrachotoxin binding site of Na+ channels in rat cortex synaptosomal preparation.
 It is concluded that protection against veratridine-induced neurotoxicity can be mediated by blocking a veratridine-sensitive Na+ channel.
 It is a property of certain nonselective Ca++ antagonists.
 There is apparently no direct relationship with Ca++ antagonistic activity.
 The effect is unrelated to local anesthetic activity.

2188,"Induction of DNA fragmentation in chronic B-lymphocytic leukemia cells.
 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B cell type (B-CLL) is a neoplastic disorder characterized by the accumulation of small resting lymphocytes in the periphery.
 The phenotype of these cells suggests that they are ""frozen"" at an early stage of maturation.
 Glucocorticoid hormones are commonly used to treat patients with B-CLL, resulting in a reduction in the peripheral lymphocyte count by an undefined mechanism.
 Here we report that glucocorticoids stimulate DNA fragmentation characteristic of a suicide process known as apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) in suspensions of cells from patients with B-CLL.
 The effects can be mimicked by Ca2+ ionophore and involve a sustained increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration.
 Specific antibodies binding to membrane-associated IgM on the leukemic cells can also induce PCD by a similar mechanism.
 Phorbol esters block DNA fragmentation and cell killing in response to all of the agents, suggesting that activation of protein kinase C desensitizes the cells to PCD.
 Targeting the B-CLL cells with antibodies that induce an unbalanced, sustained Ca2+ increase may therefore represent a rational strategy for the destruction of leukemic cells.

 Statistical criteria for suppression and aggravation of ventricular arrhythmia were defined by means of 50 short-term drug tests performed in 24 patients.
 Each patient's spontaneous variability (SV) was evaluated by linear regression analysis of hour-to-hour changes in ectopy during 24- to 48-hour Holter monitoring.
 The response to a single oral dose of disopyramide, 300 mg, flecainide, 200 mg, and propafenone, 450 mg, was measured during a trial lasting 4 hours.
 Lidocaine was administered intravenously in incremental doses of up to 4 mg/min and was evaluated over 3 hours.
 Threshold values of ventricular arrhythmia corresponding to 95% confidence limits were calculated from baseline recordings and were used to ascertain the likelihood of a true drug effect.
 The minimum decrease in hourly ectopy indicating arrhythmia suppression averaged 90.9%, while an increase of at least 947% was required for a proarrhythmic effect.
 When these efficacy criteria were applied, 16 of 50 short-term tests revealed no drug effect.
 In contrast, when a 70% threshold derived from studies of daily variability was employed, only 7 of 50 trials were negative.
 Thus individual determination of hourly arrhythmia variability yields more stringent criteria than extrapolation from day-to-day spontaneous variation.

 Current precertification criteria of Medicare beneficiaries show significant variability in the priorities and the clinical practice of cardiologists in performing coronary angioplasty, despite established and published guidelines for its safe and efficacious use.
 It is likely that the establishment of locally based criteria for coronary angioplasty will be geographically uneven and probably have a less than expected impact on the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries.

 Sixty-two female patients with chronic tension headache were randomly divided into two treatment groups--acupuncture and physiotherapy.
 Their overall function (Sickness Impact Profile), and mental well-being (Mood Adjective Check List) and the intensity and frequency of headache were assessed before and after treatment.
 Before treatment the patients showed significantly more dysfunction and less positive mental well-being than a general population sample.
 Both treatment groups improved in overall function, the physiotherapy group somewhat more.
 The mental well-being increased only in the physiotherapy group.
 The intensity and frequency of headache was significantly reduced in both the physiotherapy group and the acupuncture group.
 The intensity of headache was significantly more improved in the physiotherapy group.
 The improvement of headache intensity persisted unchanged 7-12 months after treatment.

2195,"Phenotypic variability in glutaric aciduria type I: Report of fourteen cases in five Canadian Indian kindreds.
 We describe 14 patients with glutaric aciduria type 1 in five Canadian Indian kindreds living in Manitoba and northwest Ontario.
 The patients had marked clinical variability of the disease, even within families.
 Eight followed the typical clinical course of normal early growth and development until the onset of neurologic abnormalities, often precipitated by infection, between 6 weeks and 7 1/2 months of age.
 Five patients had early developmental delay; one was thought to be normal until 8 years of age.
 Three patients died, seven are severely mentally and physically handicapped, and four have only mild mental retardation or incoordination.
 Six patients had macrocephaly in the neonatal period.
 Computed tomography was done for 12 patients, and findings were abnormal in 11.
 Glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid were detected in increased amounts in the urine of all patients, but the concentrations were much lower than those in most other reported patients.
 Glutaryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase activity in skin fibroblasts, interleukin-2-dependent lymphocytes, or both, ranged from 0% to 13% of control values.
 There was no correlation between clinical severity and urine glutaric acid concentration or level of residual enzyme activity.
 We recommend that organic acid analysis of the urine be done in patients with unexplained cerebral palsy-like disorders, especially if the computed tomographic scan is abnormal.
 If there is suspicion of glutaric aciduria, glutaryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase should be measured in fibroblasts or lymphocytes even if glutaric acid is not increased in the urine.

2196,"Nerve growth factor prevents toxic neuropathy in mice.
 Taxol is a promising new antitumor drug with therapeutic use that is limited by a toxic sensory neuropathy.
 Taxol is also cytotoxic to dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro, but this effect is prevented by cotreatment with the trophic protein, nerve growth factor.
 We sought to develop an animal model and then to determine whether nerve growth factor can prevent taxol neuropathy in vivo.
 Administration of taxol to mice resulted in a profound sensory neuropathy characterized by decreases in dorsal root ganglion content of the peptide neurotransmitter, substance P, elevated threshold to thermally induced pain, and diminished amplitude of the compound action potential in the caudal nerve.
 Coadministration of nerve growth factor prevented all of these signs of neurotoxicity.
 These findings suggest that administration of nerve growth factor may prevent certain toxic sensory neuropathies.

2197,"Pediatric behavioral neurology: an update on the neurologic aspects of depression, hyperactivity, and learning disabilities [published erratum appears in Neurol Clin 1991 Feb;9(1):viii]
 The high incidence of poor social adjustment in long-term follow-up studies of depressed children seems to relate to the inadequacy of the pharmacotherapy necessary to sustain long-lasting remission or possibly to repetitive inappropriate stresses.
 Insufficient antidepressant therapy with resultant intermittent depression-induced dysfunction of the socialization functions performed by the right cerebral hemisphere would not permit the child to develop appropriate interpersonal skills (causing failure in most social situations), and associated cognitive difficulties would complicate academic performance.
 Repeated school failure and chronic social ineptitude preclude development of the skills necessary for successful independent living in society.
 Thus, if symptoms of depression are found, it is imperative that the learning-disabled or behaviorally disturbed child or adolescent receive adequate antidepressant therapy to ensure complete long-term remission of the depression.
 In addition, learning-disabled individuals, even without apparent diagnosable depressive illness, must be offered appropriate methods for learning and communication which reduce stress.
 When such appropriate educational strategies are offered and poor performance still ensues (or continues), a trial of antidepressant therapy should be considered.
 Recognition of the depressive nature of symptoms may not be possible until treatment-induced improvement has occurred and depression-associated learning disability has resolved.
 Improvement in academic performance associated with improved cognitive function after treatment-induced remission of a depressive episode can be dramatic, with resolution of apparent learning disability.
 Poor educational achievement associated with chronic learning difficulties ultimately affects adult social functioning, and untreated or improperly treated chronic depression may result in the development of later personality disturbances.
 Therefore, before attributing school problems in children to untreatable conditions, depressive disorder must be excluded, and appropriate antidepressant therapy (along with removal of all apparent inappropriate stress, including inappropriate demands on brain function) should be provided to children and adolescents with evidence of depression.

2198,"Tears of cruciate ligaments and menisci: evaluation with cine MR imaging.
 A cine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique, involving the acquisition of kinematic sagittal images during knee movement, was used to evaluate 52 symptomatic knee joints.
 Results were compared with those obtained by means of static three-dimensional (3D) MR imaging.
 Twenty-seven of the 28 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and 22 of 24 normal ligaments were correctly identified at cine MR imaging for a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 92%.
 Static 3D MR imaging yielded a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 88%.
 All four posterior cruciate ligament tears were identified at cine and 3D MR imaging.
 For meniscal tears, cine MR imaging yielded a sensitivity of 48% and a specificity of 96%; the sensitivity and specificity for 3D MR imaging were 71% and 96%, respectively.
 Cine MR imaging proved to be more useful than static MR imaging in assessing the tightness of cruciate ligaments, especially of those that were partially torn, and in assessing the movement of meniscal-free fragments.
 The increased information obtained with cine MR imaging may warrant continued investigation and clinical application.

 A clinical trial, aimed at secondary prevention of low-back pain, was performed in 142 hospital employees reporting at least three annual episodes of this condition.
 Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a calisthenics program (CAL) for 3 months with biweekly sessions of flexion exercises, a back school program (5 sessions), and a control group.
 The effectiveness of the two intervention programs was evaluated over a 1-year period.
 Baseline preintervention data and evaluation at the end of 3 months of intervention and after an additional 6 months were collected.
 A monthly surveillance for the whole year showed a mean of 4.5 ""painful months"" in the CAL group versus 7.3 and 7.4 months in the back school and control groups, respectively (P less than 0.0001).
 The superiority of the CAL group was achieved partly because of the significant increase in trunk forward flexion and to initial increment in abdominal muscle strength.
 The increased trunk flexion was associated with the rate of participation in the CAL sessions.
 Further research is needed to answer the question of ""intensity versus type of exercise"" by comparing different intervention programs, with similar intensity.

2202,"Angiographic morphology in unstable angina and its relation to transient myocardial ischemia and hospital outcome.
 Complex stenosis morphology frequently occurs in patients with unstable angina pectoris.
 However, its relation to transient myocardial ischemia and hospital outcome has not been ascertained.
 To address this issue, 88 patients with significant (greater than or equal to 50%) coronary artery disease presenting with angina--new onset (n = 38), worsening (n = 20) or at rest (n = 30)-were studied.
 Patients with left main artery disease, normal coronary arteries or occlusion of the ischemia-related arteries were not included in the study.
 Continuous electrocardiographic recordings were obtained during the first 24 hours.
 Angiography was performed within 1 week from admission.
 Complex morphology was defined as any stenosis with irregular borders, overhanging edges or intracoronary thrombus.
 Only data referring to the in-hospital outcome were considered in this study.
 Adverse end points were sudden death, myocardial infarction and emergency revascularization.
 Analysis of the angiograms revealed a complex morphology in 58 patients (group 1).
 The remaining 30 patients served as control subjects (group 2).
 Thirty-two of the 58 group 1 patients had an unfavorable clinical outcome (positive predictive value, 55%).
 A similar outcome occurred in only 2 of the 30 group 2 patients (negative predictive value, 93%).
 Of the 32 group 1 patients who had an unfavorable clinical outcome, 29 had a cumulative duration of transient myocardial ischemia of greater than or equal to 60 minutes per 24 hours.
 A similar duration of ischemia, however, was observed in another 6 group 1 and in 8 group 2 patients.

2203,"Multicenter patency trial of intravenous anistreplase compared with streptokinase in acute myocardial infarction. The TEAM-2 Study Investigators.
 Thrombolytic therapy has been shown to improve clinical outcome when administered early after the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction; the mechanism of benefit is believed to be reestablishment and maintenance of coronary artery patency.
 Anistreplase is a second generation thrombolytic agent that is easily administered and has a long duration of action.
 To compare anistreplase (30 units/2-5 min) and therapy with the Food and Drug Administration-approved regimen of intravenous streptokinase (1.5 million units/60 min), a randomized, double-blind, multicenter patency trial was undertaken in 370 patients less than 76 years of age with electrocardiographic ST segment elevation who could be treated within 4 hours of symptom onset.
 Coronary patency was determined by reading, in a blinded fashion, angiograms obtained early (90-240 minutes; mean, 140 minutes) and later (18-48 hours; mean, 28 hours) after beginning therapy.
 Early total patency (defined as Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction grade 2 or 3 perfusion) was high after both anistreplase (132/183 = 72%) and streptokinase (129/176 = 73%) therapy, and overall patency patterns were similar, although patent arteries showed ""complete"" (grade 3) perfusion more often after anistreplase (83%) than streptokinase (72%) (p = 0.03).
 Similarly, residual coronary stenosis, determined quantitatively by a validated computer-assisted method, was slightly less in patent arteries early after anistreplase (mean stenosis diameter, 74.0%) than streptokinase (77.2%, p = 0.02).
 In patients with patent arteries without other early interventions, reocclusion risk within 1-2 days was defined angiographically and found to be very low (anistreplase = 1/96, streptokinase = 2/94).
 Average coronary perfusion grade was greater, and percent residual stenosis was less, at follow-up than on initial evaluation and did not differ between treatment groups.
 Enzymatic and electrocardiographic evolution was not significantly different in the two groups.
 Despite rapid injection, anistreplase was associated with only a small (4-5 mm Hg), transient (at 5-10 minutes) mean differential fall in blood pressure.
 In-hospital mortality rates were comparable for anistreplase and streptokinase (5.9%, 7.1%).
 Stroke occurred in one (0.5%) and three (1.6%) patients, respectively; one stroke was hemorrhagic.
 Other serious bleeding events and adverse experiences occurred uncommonly and with similar frequency in the two groups.
 Thus, for the end points of our study (patency, safety), anistreplase and streptokinase showed overall favorable and relatively comparable outcomes, with a few differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

2204,"Therapeutic outcome of patients suffering from malignant melanomas of the conjunctiva.
 Eighty-one cases of conjunctival melanoma treated between 1960 and 1988 were studied to determine factors that might affect outcome in patients with such lesions.
 The therapeutic procedures performed were local excision (16), local excision followed by brachytherapy with Sr-90/Y-90 (32), local excision followed by cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen (16), brachytherapy with Sr-90/Y-90 (12), local excision followed by external beam irradiation (3), and local excision followed by brachytherapy and cryotherapy (2).
 The median follow-up period was 5.5 years (longest 26, shortest 1 year).
 Sixty two patients (76.5%) showed a complete regression of the melanoma, 19 (23.5%) developed recurrences, and 15 (18.5%) died from metastases.
 The melanomas had developed with almost equal frequency from a pre-existing naevus (25.9%), from primary acquired melanosis (25.9%), and 'de novo' (30.9%).
 Small tumours had a higher chance of regressing (80.6%) than larger ones (68.6%).
 The cumulative survival rate was 76% after five years and 60% after 10 years from any causes of death and 87.6% after five years and 76.3% after 10 years from deaths caused by metastases.
 Most deaths from metastases occurred within 5 years.
 At 88.5%, the cumulative survival rate of patients with small tumours (less than one quadrant of the bulbar conjunctiva and less than 2 mm thickness) was significantly higher than that of patients with larger tumours (more than one quadrant of the bulbar conjunctiva and/or more than 2 mm thickness) with 65% after eight years.
 Local excision followed by beta ray irradiation (Sr-90/Y-90) or cryotherapy can be recommended as the treatment of choice.
 Nevertheless the behaviour of conjunctival melanomas remains unpredictable in individual cases.

 The prognostic value of nuclear DNA content was studied retrospectively using flow cytometry in 203 cases of resected hepatocellular carcinoma.
 The occurrence of DNA aneuploidy, which was detected in 50% of patients, correlated significantly with tumor size and the presence of vascular invasion or intrahepatic metastasis.
 Overall, patients with DNA aneuploid tumors had a significantly worse prognosis than those with DNA diploid tumors (P less than 0.001) and, also in subdivided groups by tumor size (P less than 0.01).
 Among DNA aneuploid patients, the survival times were significantly shorter for patients with a low DNA index (less than 1.5) than for those with a high DNA index (greater than or equal to 1.5) (P less than 0.05).
 In a Cox multivariate analysis, nuclear DNA content provided significant prognostic value (P = 0.008), as did vascular invasion (P = 0.001) and intrahepatic metastasis (P = 0.005).
 These results indicated that nuclear DNA content has an important prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma.

 Plasma levels of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) and noradrenaline were studied for 25 h in 22 patients with acute ischaemic heart disease.
 On admission, NPY-LI levels were above normal in 16 patients, and 20 patients had increased noradrenaline levels.
 The initial plasma NPY-LI did not differ between patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and angina pectoris.
 Initial plasma noradrenaline levels were higher in patients with AMI than in those with angina pectoris.
 Plasma levels of noradrenaline remained elevated in AMI patients, but decreased towards normal values in patients with angina pectoris.
 Levels of NPY-LI returned to normal within 25 h in all patients.
 Tachycardia and left ventricular failure were related to high NPY-LI and noradrenaline levels.
 A positive correlation was found between noradrenaline and NPY-LI in plasma.

2207,"High-dose etoposide and marrow transplantation.
 Etoposide underwent conventional Phase I testing in the 1970s.
 The dose-limiting toxicity in these studies was mild myelosuppression; other toxicities were infrequent.
 If a greater degree of myelosuppression is accepted, higher than standard doses could be given.
 This approach takes advantage of the steep dose-response relationship for most chemotherapeutic agents, including etoposide, as shown in early in vitro and clinical studies.
 Thus, etoposide was considered an ideal agent for further dose-escalation studies, given its wide range of clinical antitumor activity at standard doses, steep dose-response curve, mild bone marrow suppression, and few nonmyeloid side effects.
 The high-dose etoposide studies that followed used improved and more intensive hematologic supportive care, including, in some trials, autologous marrow transplantation.
 When etoposide was used as a single agent in these high-dose trials, mucositis, and, to a lesser degree, hepatic dysfunction were dose-limiting.
 The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in this setting was 2.4 to 3.0 g/m2.
 Multi-agent Phase I trials with etoposide and cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation, carmustine, or carboplatin also resulted in dose-limiting mucosal toxicity, with liver and lung problems appearing more often than with high-dose etoposide alone.
 The toxicity and MTD can be influenced markedly by the schedule of administration.
 Etoposide as a continuous intravenous infusion can be given at doses of 4.2 g/m2 (with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide) with similar toxicity, but without marrow support.
 The antitumor results in the lymphomas set the stage for treatment of solid tumors, where treatment of patients with ""sensitive"" relapses had the best outcome.
 Lymphoma patients had an 80% response rate; overall, long-term (greater than 2 years) disease-free survival was approximately 40%.
 Germ cell tumors were also responsive, and the same pattern of sensitive relapses and improvement in responding patients was seen (50% to 75% of patients greater than 1 year).
 In breast cancer and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), high-dose etoposide-containing regimens were used to intensify standard therapy.
 The results in these settings were not quite as good (breast cancer, 30% disease-free survival at 2 years; SCLC, 10% at 2 years).

 We performed cardiac evaluations in 59 infants referred for severe lung disease to determine whether cardiac performance was impaired in those requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
 Infants were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 25) received conventional therapy and group 2 (n = 34) received ECMO therapy after meeting established criteria.
 Ventilatory and oxygenation indexes and estimates of right ventricular systolic pressure were measured.
 Load-dependent and load-independent echocardiographic indexes of cardiac performance were also measured.
 The infants in the two groups had similar diagnoses, age, weight, inotropic support, ventilator and oxygenation indexes on admission, and survival.
 Heart rate and estimates of preload and afterload were similar in the two groups.
 Ventricular shortening fraction was 36.1 +/- 7.6% in group 1 and 40.5 +/- 8.8% in group 2 (p value was not significant).
 Velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF/sec) was 1.41 +/- 0.35 in group 1 and 1.58 +/- 0.39 in group 2 (p value was not significant).
 The relationship between wall stress and ventricular shortening was similar in the two groups.
 There were no differences in cardiac output.
 Pulmonary artery pressure was estimated to be 56 +/- 13 mm Hg in group 1 and 63 +/- 10 mm Hg in group 2 (p = 0.017).
 Thus no significant differences were found in load-dependent or load-independent measures of cardiac performance in infants with severe lung disease treated with ECMO or conventional therapy.

 As CT scanning has evolved as a reliable clinical tool, the use of angiography in the diagnosis of aortic aneurysmal disease has diminished.
 Fewer than 25% of patients with aortic aneurysmal disease undergo aortic angiographic evaluation at our institution.
 A prospective clinical study was undertaken to assess the validity of this policy.
 One hundred patients with clinical or ultrasonographic evidence of aortic aneurysms were evaluated prospectively during the period July 1987 to December 1989.
 All patients underwent CT scanning as an initial evaluation.
 Patients were selected for angiography if they fulfilled any of the following criteria: radiographic evidence of thoracoabdominal or juxtarenal aneurysms, or horseshoe kidney; or clinical suggestion of renal artery stenosis, mesenteric arterial insufficiency, aortoiliac occlusive disease, or lower extremity aneurysmal disease.
 During this period 19 patients (19%) underwent both CT scanning and angiography.
 The indications for angiography were thoracoabdominal aneurysms (7), juxtarenal aneurysms (2), clinical evidence of mesenteric insufficiency (1) or renal insufficiency (2), evidence of lower extremity aneurysmal disease (3), or severe aortoiliac occlusive disease (4).
 Eighty-one patients (81%) underwent CT scanning as the only radiographic evaluation.
 No patient was adversely affected by elimination of angiographic evaluation.
 CT scanning revealed inflammatory aneurysms (4), retroaortic renal veins (2), and horseshoe kidney (1).

2210,"A consensus approach to electrolytes and blood pressure. Could we all be right?
 This commentary sets forth the hypothesis that the putative beneficial or detrimental effects of specific electrolytes on blood pressure regulation in fact reflect highly integrated responses to interactions among these cationic and anionic species.
 In this paradigm, the impact of any given intake of an electrolyte on arterial pressure will be influenced by the concurrent consumption of other electrolytes.
 Thus, the heterogeneous blood pressure response in humans to isolated manipulations of nutrients such as sodium, calcium, and potassium may be determined, in part, by the adequacy of the dietary intake of other mineral elements.
 If this hypothesis is validated by continued research in this area, we would have new strategies available to improve blood pressure control in humans.
 For example, treatment of ""NaCl sensitivity"" in some humans might be more effectively approached by correcting dietary deficiencies of either potassium or calcium than by restricting dietary NaCl.

 We examined variations in interictal spiking during sleep and wakefulness to assess differences in reliability for localizing epileptic foci.
 Forty patients were studied prospectively.
 Spikes were assessed for rates, field, and appearance of new foci.
 Final localization was determined by surgery, electrocorticography, and seizure onset.
 Comparison of interictal EEG foci with final localization was made.
 In 39 patients, slow-wave sleep activated spiking compared with wakefulness.
 Most patients showed maximal spiking in sleep stages 3 or 4.
 Restriction of field in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness, and extension of field in slow-wave sleep occurred.
 New foci appeared in non-rapid eye movement sleep in 53% of patients.
 Similar but not identical spiking rates, foci, and field distributions were seen in wakefulness and REM sleep.

 Strategies for the treatment of cancer of the oesophagus depend on the tumour stage at the time of diagnosis.
 Resection, the only curative treatment, is confined to early tumour stages.
 Tumours with local infiltration are usually unresectable and require palliative treatment.
 Computed tomography has been widely used for preoperative staging but often fails to define this correctly.
 Endoscopic ultrasound allows direct visualisation of the parietal wall and may be useful in staging gastrointestinal tumours.
 In a comparative prospective study, 52 patients with tumours of the oesophagus were investigated preoperatively both by endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography to determine the stage of tumour infiltration and local lymph node involvement.
 Thirty seven of these patients underwent operation, resection, or dissection and entered the study.
 The intraoperative findings or the histopathological assessment, or both, were taken as a reference.
 For all TN stages of oesophageal tumours, correct preoperative staging was accomplished by endoscopic ultrasound in 89% for T stage and 69% for N stage compared with 51% and 51% respectively by computed tomography (highly significant using Fisher's exact test).
 This study shows that endoscopic ultrasound is useful in preoperative TN staging of tumours of the oesophagus.

 Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats were maintained on a diet containing normal (0.45%) or high (7%) salt for 5 days.
 The DS rats had slightly higher systolic blood pressures than DR rats, although a high salt diet failed to significantly elevate pressure in either group when compared with their appropriate (low salt diet) controls.
 The sensitivity of the isolated, perfused mesenteric vasculature from DS rats fed a high salt diet to nerve stimulation was greater when compared with all other groups in the presence or absence of cocaine (1 microM).
 A similar difference in sensitivity between high salt DS rats and high salt DR rats to bolus injections of norepinephrine was observed only in the presence of cocaine.
 The change in sensitivity was characterized by a leftward shift of the dose-response curve without a change in maximum response.
 No difference in sensitivity between the high salt DS group and any other treatment group was observed in response to the pressor agents KCl, angiotensin II, 5-hydroxytryptamine or the depressor agent acetylcholine.
 These data indicate that DS rats on a short-term, high salt diet possess a significant and specific elevation in sensitivity to nerve stimulation and norepinephrine in the absence of an increase in blood pressure.
 Differences in the effectiveness of cocaine among the groups suggest that differences may exist in neuronal uptake (uptake 1).

 Results of one third of the GH tests were defined as normal (GH peak response, greater than 15 mU/L) within the first 5 years, in comparison with 16% after 5 years.
 Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that dose (p = 0.007) and time from irradiation (p = 0.03), but not age at therapy, had a significant influence on peak GH responses.
 The late incidence of GH deficiency was similar over the whole dose range (4 of 26 GH test results normal for less than 30 Gy and 4 of 25 normal for greater than or equal to 30 Gy after 5 years), but the speed of onset over the first years was dependent on dose.
 We conclude that the requirement for GH replacement therapy and the timing of its introduction will be influenced by the dose of irradiation received by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

 This study explores the relationship between histologic variants of bone sarcomas and previous therapy in patients in whom an unrelated malignant neoplasm had been diagnosed during childhood.
 Sarcomas of bone were the most common second malignant neoplasm (SMN) reported to the Late Effects Study Group, a 13-institution consortium consisting of pediatric oncology centers from western Europe, Canada, and the United States.
 The authors attempted to relate the histologic subtypes of the 91 bone tumors to clinical factors such as previous therapy and genetic predisposition because morphologic variants have been shown to have biologic significance in other tumors and may have etiologic import.
 The literature concerning the subtypes of bone tumors, clinical and experimental, is also reviewed.
 The authors also investigated the effect of several factors on the time interval from the first diagnosis to the SMN (i.e., the bone sarcoma).
 Anthracyclines significantly shortened the interval by about 3 years.
 The primary diagnosis also significantly affected the interval, with leukemia/lymphomas having the shortest interval and retinoblastoma the longest.
 The authors could not demonstrate any significant relationship between morphologic characteristics of the osteosarcoma and predisposing conditions.
 However, lesions diagnosed as chondrosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma occurred almost exclusively in patients who had received radiation therapy to the site in which the SMN developed.

 The management was modified 3 days before the second autonomic evaluation, so as to reestablish the same diet and pharmacologic conditions of the previous study.
 Compensation led to significant reduction in symptom-based class, body weight, and pulmonary and systemic congestion.
 Mean +/- standard error of the mean HR responses (beats/min) before and after compensation were, respectively: (1) to atropine (0.04 mg/kg): 10 +/- 2 and 27 +/- 2 (p less than 0.01); (2) to handgrip (30% maximum capacity, 1 minute): 9 +/- 2 and 19 +/- 3 (p less than 0.005); (3) to headup tilt (5 minutes): 4 +/- 3 and 20 +/- 4 (p less than 0.005).
 Mean +/- standard error of the mean baroreflex sensitivity (ms/mm Hg) of RR responses to phenylephrine and amyl nitrate-induced changes in systolic pressure was, respectively, in each condition: phenylephrine, 0.9 +/- 0.2 and 8 +/- 2.3 (p less than 0.05); amyl nitrate, 0.3 +/- 0.2 and 4.1 +/- 1.1 (p less than 0.05).
 A significant correlation between improvement in HR responses to atropine and tilt and changes in body weight was obtained.
 These findings show a reversible component of impaired baroreflex control of HR in severe CHF, possibly due to its congestive effects.

2219,"Heart transplantation in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and increased pulmonary vascular resistance.
 Irreversibly increased pulmonary vascular resistance is a contraindication for cardiac transplantation.
 At our hospital patients referred for recipient evaluation with systolic pulmonary artery pressure greater than 50 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 2 Wood units (Wu) are tested with intravenous sodium nitroprusside for reversibility.
 In 23 patients whose increased systolic pulmonary artery pressure (67.4 +/- 10.4 mmHg) and resistance (4.8 +/- 2.4 Wu) were reduced by nitroprusside, orthotopic heart transplantation was performed without early mortality.
 Right heart catheterization after transplantation revealed a significant and persistent fall of the elevated pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance.
 We conclude that if severe pulmonary hypertension and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance are reversible with nitroprusside, the patient can safely undergo heart transplantation.

 Surgical voice restoration using the Blom-Singer technique is a well-established procedure in patients who have undergone simple laryngectomy.
 Operations for hypopharyngeal carcinoma are more extensive and require reconstruction using regional skin or myocutaneous flaps, or reanastomosis with colon, jejunum, or stomach.
 We report the use of the Blom-Singer prosthesis in four patients who had undergone pharyngogastric repair following laryngopharyngoesophagectomy and who had failed to achieve a satisfactory voice.
 All patients initially developed good speech using the prosthesis.
 Two patients subsequently had their prostheses removed: one because of recurrent malignant disease and one because the procedure had not significantly altered the quality of the voice.
 The remaining two patients have continued to use the device at 2 and 5 years after insertion with good voice production.

2221,"Recognition and embolic potential of intraaortic atherosclerotic debris.
 Atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta is common in the elderly and patients with clinical coronary artery disease.
 Although embolization can occur from atherosclerotic debris within the thoracic aorta, it is not commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of the source of a systemic embolism.
 In the current study, the prevalence, clinical significance and embolic potential of intraaortic atherosclerotic debris as detected by transesophageal echocardiography was determined.
 Intraaortic atherosclerotic debris was identified in 38 (7%) of 556 patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography.
 An embolic event occurred among 11 (31%) of the 36 study patients with intraaortic atherosclerotic debris.
 The incidence of an embolic event was higher when the debris was pedunculated and highly mobile (8 [73%] of 11 patients) than when it was layered and immobile (3 [12%] of 25 patients) (p less than 0.002).
 Among 15 patients undergoing an invasive procedure of the aorta, the incidence of embolism was 27%.
 In conclusion, in a patient with an embolic event, the thoracic aorta should be considered as a potential source.
 Transesophageal echocardiography can reliably detect intraaortic atherosclerotic debris, and when it is identified, an invasive aortic procedure should be avoided if possible.

 The pharmacokinetics of alfentanil, 300 micrograms.kg-1 IV, were determined in patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic reconstruction.
 The mean age (+/- SD) of the patients was 64.3 +/- 7.4 yr; their mean weight was 74.7 +/- 13.8 kg.
 Five patients underwent aneurysm repair and six had aortobifemoral grafting.
 Serum alfentanil concentrations were measured by gas-liquid chromatography in samples drawn at increasing intervals over a 24-hr period.
 A three-compartment model was fitted to the concentration versus time data.
 The volume of the central compartment and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) were 0.44 +/- 0.022 and 0.63 +/- 0.32 L.kg-1, respectively.
 Total drug clearance was 6.4 = 1.9 ml.min-1.kg-1.
 The elimination half-time was 3.7 +/- 2.6 hr.
 Patient age was positively correlated with both Vdss and elimination half-time.
 There were no significant correlations between the pharmacokinetic variables and the duration of aortic cross-clamping, the duration of surgery, or the rate or total volume of IV fluids infused intraoperatively.
 In general surgical patients, the elimination half-time of alfentanil has been reported to be 1.2-2.0 hr.
 Although the elimination half-time of alfentanil was longer in patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery, alfentanil was eliminated much faster than either fentanyl or sufentanil in this patient population.

 As part of a phase II clinical trial, 14 patients with presumed intracranial neoplastic disease underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and after intravenous injection of gadolinium 1,4,7-tris(carboxymethyl)-10-(2'-hydroxypropyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacycl ododecane (HP-DO3A).
 This neutral (nonionic) gadolinium chelate has lower osmolality, when formulated at equimolar concentrations, and superior in vitro stability compared with gadopentetate dimeglumine.
 The safety profile of Gd-HP-DO3A permitted administration of doses up to 0.3 mmol/kg, three times the dose of gadopentetate dimeglumine approved by the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration.
 In this limited clinical trial, Gd-HP-DO3A proved to be a safe and efficacious agent in MR imaging of the head.
 The only change documented in patient monitoring was that of slight skin redness at the injection site immediately after administration in two patients.
 No statistically significant changes due to administration of the agent were noted in laboratory evaluations.
 These results differ from those obtained with gadopentetate, which induces a transient rise in serum iron and bilirubin levels in up to 26% of patients.
 Administration of higher doses of Gd-HP-DO3A, either 0.2 or 0.3 mmol/kg, appeared to provide improved enhancement.

 We report a series of 42 consecutive patients with aneurysms of the distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA).
 Of these, 36 patients had one aneurysm, 5 had two aneurysms, and one had three aneurysms.
 Thirty patients had a ruptured distal ACA aneurysm; among these patients, the size of the aneurysm was less than 5 mm in diameter in 20, 6 to 10 mm in 7, and larger than 11 mm in 3.
 Eighteen patients (42.9%) had multiple aneurysms, and distal ACA aneurysms were responsible for a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 10.
 Thirty-four patients underwent direct surgery, and 30 of these had excellent outcomes 3 months after surgery.
 The treatment of patients with distal ACA aneurysms is often technically difficult, because of their broad neck configuration and the coexistence of other aneurysms.
 Nevertheless, the present study emphasizes that distal ACA aneurysms tend to bleed, irrespective of their size, and that excellent outcomes are obtainable by direct surgery.

 Methadone maintenance is the most frequently utilized treatment for heroin addiction and also represents one of the best AIDS-prevention tools for the IV drug using population.
 Despite these important roles, very little has been reported about how methadone maintenance clinics are staffed.
 Surveys covering various aspects of program operations, including staffing, were sent to all clinics (N = 557) listed in the 1984 National Directory of Drug Abuse and Alcohol Treatment Programs.
 Using ANOVA, staffing patterns were compared across programs as a function of clinic size, city size, region of the country, and funding resources.
 While few differences were found based on city or clinic size, staffing patterns varied as a function of regional location as well as the sources of a clinic's funding.

 We have studied the pharmacokinetics of 20-h infusions of methohexitone in young patients with postoperative fever undergoing artificial ventilation of the lungs.
 The infusion rate was adjusted so that patients were unresponsive to vocal stimulation but reacted to tracheal suction.
 The mean steady state concentration of methohexitone required was 2.6 mg litre-1 (unbound 0.53 mg litre-1).
 The mean (SD) total clearance of methohexitone was 16.3 (4.2) ml min-1 kg-1, which is greater than that for volunteers or normal surgical patients.
 The unbound clearance correlated positively with body temperature during the infusion (r = 0.796, P = 0.017).
 The terminal half-life of methohexitone was 6.3 (3.8) h and that of the 4'-hydroxy metabolite 5.8 (2.1) h.
 There were no marked haemodynamic effects of the infusion, and no excessive sedation after the infusion.
 However, the clearance of methohexitone was high and variable, possibly as a direct effect of postoperative fever.
 Consequently, the need for individual titration of the rate of infusion is emphasized.

 Symptoms compatible with vertebrobasilar ischemia have been reported in patients with unilateral or bilateral carotid occlusive disease.
 Intracranial steal phenomena have been proposed to explain the symptoms.
 In a review of 54 patients with angiographically documented severe bilateral carotid stenosis (less than or equal to 2 mm residual lumen) or occlusion, eight had symptoms suggesting vertebrobasilar insufficiency.
 Five patients were identified retrospectively, and the other three were evaluated prospectively.
 Symptoms included various combinations of hemodynamically mediated, transient bilateral motor, sensory, or visual impairment.
 Dysarthria, dysphagia, and diplopia were generally absent.
 Each patient also described additional symptoms compatible with transient hemispheric or retinal ischemia.
 The anatomic regions subserving the bilateral vertebrobasilar-like symptoms could be correlated with angiographically estimated arterial border zones in both hemispheres and may thus represent bilateral hemispheric border zone ischemia rather than brain stem ischemia.
 An intracranial steal need not be invoked.

 During surgery, occlusion of the LSVC markedly increased the venous pressure, precluding its ligation.
 Because of the malposition of the heart and the unusual atrial anatomy, correction with an intra-atrial baffle was not attempted.
 After correcting the intra-cardiac anomaly, the LSVC was divided and anastomosed to the ""right"" atrial appendage using a segment of PTFE graft.

2230,"The rat glucagon gene is regulated by a protein kinase A-dependent pathway in pancreatic islet cells.
 A cAMP response element (CRE) has been identified in the proximal 5'-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene, and activation of the cAMP-dependent pathway in fetal rat intestinal cells leads to an increase in the levels of glucagon mRNA transcripts.
 In contrast, the human glucagon gene does not contain a similar CRE, and the results of studies using immortalized rat and hamster islet cell lines have suggested that glucagon gene expression may not be regulated by cAMP.
 To reconcile these observations, we have studied the control of glucagon gene expression.
 Incubation of primary rat islet cell cultures with forskolin in the presence of low (0.5 g/liter) or high (2.0 g/L) glucose resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the levels of glucagon mRNA transcripts.
 Forskolin also stimulated the secretion and synthesis of immunoreactive glucagon.
 The importance of the protein kinase-A-dependent pathway in the regulation of glucagon gene expression was also examined in hamster islet InR1-G9 cells.
 Cotransfection of a glucagon-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene containing the glucagon CRE and a cDNA encoding the catalytic subunit of protein kinase-A resulted in stimulation of glucagon-CAT activity in hamster islet cells.
 Catalytic subunit cotransfection also activated somatostatin-CAT, but no activation of RSVCAT was detected.
 The results of these experiments suggest that the rat glucagon gene is regulated by a protein kinase-A-dependent pathway in the endocrine pancreas.

 O6-Ethylguanine (O6-EtGua) is one of about a dozen different alkylation products formed in the DNA of cells exposed to the alkylating N-nitroso carcinogen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (EtNU).
 We have evaluated selectively the relative capacity of cells for the specific enzymatic repair of O6-EtGua as a determinant for the probability of malignant conversion.
 Eleven O6-EtGua-repair-proficient (R+) variant subclones were isolated from the O6-EtGua-repair-deficient (R-) clonal rat fibroblast line 208F by selection for resistance to 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (frequency, approximately equal to 10(-5).
 Contrary to the 208F wild-type cells, all variants expressed O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity, while both kinds of cells were deficient for repair of the DNA ethylation products O2- and O4-ethylthymine.
 After exposure to EtNU (less than or equal to 500 micrograms/ml; 20 min), cells were analyzed for the formation of piled-up foci in monolayer culture and of anchorage-independent colonies in semisolid agar medium.
 Depending on the EtNU concentration, the frequencies of piled-up foci and agar colonies, respectively, in the R+ variants were as low as 1/28th and 1/56th of those in the R- wild type.
 Contrasting with the cells from R+ variant-derived agar colonies, cells from 208F (R-) agar colonies gave rise to highly malignant tumors when implanted subcutaneously into syngeneic rats.
 No significant differences in the frequencies of piled-up foci were found between wild-type and variant cells after exposure to the major reactive metabolite of benzo[a]pyrene, (+)-7 beta, 8 alpha-dihydroxy-9,10 alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10 alpha-tetrahydrobenzo[a] pyrene, for which stable binding to guanine O6 in cellular DNA has not been observed.
 The relative capacity of cells for repair of O6-alkylguanine is, therefore, a critical determinant for their risk of malignant conversion by N-nitroso carcinogens.

 The incidence of definite cytological evidence of CIN was significantly lower in women whose first smear did not include an endocervical component.

 We studied which algorithm of testing and finding threshold should be used in automatic systems by comparing among algorithms and stimulus conditions for the index finger of healthy subjects and for the great toe of patients with mild neuropathy.
 Appearance thresholds obtained by linear ramps increasing at a rate less than 4.15 microns/sec provided accurate and repeatable thresholds compared with thresholds obtained by forced-choice testing.
 These rates would be acceptable if only sensitive sites were studied, but they were too slow for use in automatic testing of insensitive parts.
 Appearance thresholds obtained by fast linear rates (4.15 or 16.6 microns/sec) overestimated threshold, especially for sensitive parts.
 Use of the mean of appearance and disappearance thresholds, with the stimulus increasing exponentially at rates of 0.5 or 1.0 just noticeable difference (JND) units per second, and interspersion of null stimuli, Bekesy with null stimuli, provided accurate, repeatable, and fast estimates of threshold for sensitive parts.

 Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) is a peptide so named because it helps to impart anchorage-independent growth to normal rat kidney (NRK) cells in vitro and is secreted by many rodent and human tumor cells.
 To directly investigate the transforming properties of this factor, we constructed a replication-defective murine retrovirus that expresses the human sequence coding for TGF alpha.
 Infection of NIH/3T3 cells with the TGF alpha retrovirus led to the integration of a transcriptionally active provirus and overexpression of biologically active TGF alpha, but failed to induce morphologic transformation.
 Similarly, the TGF alpha retrovirus failed to induce morphologic transformation of five other types of rodent fibroblasts.
 We also investigated the effect of TGF alpha expression on the growth of BALB/MK mouse keratinocytes, which require epidermal growth factor (EGF) for proliferation.
 We show that exogenously added TGF alpha is an extremely potent mitogen for BALB/MK cells.
 However, retroviral expression of TGF alpha in BALB/MK cells failed to relieve dependence on exogenously added EGF (or TGF alpha) for cell growth.
 These results suggest that overexpression of TGF alpha does not, by itself, transform rodent fibroblasts or keratinocytes.

2238,"Vegetables, fruits, and carotenoids and the risk of cancer.
 Low intake of vegetables, fruits, and carotenoids is consistently associated with increased risk of lung cancer in both prospective and retrospective studies.
 In addition, low levels of beta-carotene in serum or plasma are consistently associated with the subsequent development of lung cancer.
 The simplest explanation is that beta-carotene is protective.
 Since retinol (preformed vitamin A) is not related in a similar manner to lung cancer risk, beta-carotene appears to function through a mechanism that does not require conversion into vitamin A.
 However, the importance of other carotenoids and other constituents of vegetables and fruit has not been adequately explored.
 Both prospective and retrospective studies suggest that vegetable and fruit intake may reduce the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, bladder, and cervix.

 Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment for human brain tumors because of the selective retention of certain compounds by tumor cells.
 Certain lipophilic cationic compounds, such as tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), are selectively taken up by a variety of carcinomas.
 Although preferential retention of TPP has been demonstrated for the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, this compound had not been tested previously on cells derived from nervous system tumors.
 In the present study, tritiated-TPP (3H-TPP) uptake and retention for eight different cell cultures of three histologically different types of nervous system tumors was measured and the data were compared to a positive control (MCF-7) and negative controls (normal African Green monkey kidney epithelium (CV-1) and the normal human fibroblast (WI-38) cell lines).
 Uptake and retention characteristics could be grouped by specific pathological tumor types, but individual tumor variability was notable.
 Malignant astrocytoma (grade III/III glioblastoma) and malignant neurofibrosarcoma cells showed preferential uptake and retention of 3H-TPP relative to meningioma cells and normal controls.
 A clonogenic assay utilizing the cytotoxic lipophilic cationic compound dequalinium showed strong retainers of 3H-TPP to be more susceptible to the effects of dequalinium than weak retainers.
 These data demonstrate that certain human and experimental animal nervous system tumor cell lines retain lipophilic compounds possessing a delocalized positive charge.

 Stress such as inflammation produces an acute phase response that includes elevated levels of ceruloplasmin, the main copper component of plasma.
 Inflammatory effects on cellular copper enzyme activity levels are largely unknown.
 Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in liver, the main site of ceruloplasmin secretion, decreased with turpentine-induced inflammation (0.1 mL, intramuscular, leg) in rats fed any of three copper levels (adequate = 6 mg/kg, marginal = 2.5 mg/kg and deficient less than 0.5 mg/kg).
 Ceruloplasmin activities rose significantly with inflammation in the adequate and marginal groups but not in the deficient animals.
 Hepatic Cu-Zn SOD immunoreactive protein levels were unaffected by copper status or inflammatory state.
 Erythrocyte Cu-Zn SOD activities were influenced by dietary copper but not inflammation.
 An additional group of rats fed 15 mg copper/kg did not show a turpentine-induced decrease in liver Cu-Zn activity levels.
 Inflammatory effects on other copper enzyme activities did occur as evidenced by increases in ceruloplasmin and decreases in serum extracellular SOD.
 In conclusion, an acute phase response in rats increased the amount of dietary copper required to maintain hepatic Cu-Zn SOD activity at levels equal to those of nonstressed, copper-adequate rats.
 Rat erythrocyte Cu-Zn SOD activities provided a blood measurement reflective of copper intake with or without stress, but these values did not reflect decreases in liver Cu-Zn SOD activities after 3 d of inflammation.

 Analyses in this study were based on hemodynamic and angiographic data obtained in a cohort of 1,371 predominantly black patients during right and left heart catheterization.
 All patients were followed up prospectively for a mean of 117 weeks, and 103 fatal events were recorded.
 In Cox survival analysis, three variables were found to be independently related to survival: pulmonary artery mean pressure (PAMP), number of stenosed vessels, and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (p less than 0.01); in multivariate stepwise analysis, PAMP entered the model first with the largest chi 2 value of the three prognostic variables (chi 2 = 33.4; p less than 0.0001).
 The PAMP was 32 percent higher in decedents compared with survivors (25 + 11 mm Hg vs 19 + 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.01 [mean, SD]) and a 10 mm Hg increase in PAMP was associated with a more than fourfold increase in the relative risk of dying; this finding was independent of pulmonary vascular resistance and therefore could not be attributed to primary pulmonary vascular or parenchymal disease.
 In both the subgroup of 1,118 patients with a normal LV ejection fraction (greater than 50 percent) and the 253 patients with a reduced ejection fraction (less than 50 percent), PAMP emerged as an independent predictor of mortality (p less than 0.0001 and 0.01, respectively), and is therefore a marker of cardiac disease beyond impairment of systolic contractile function.
 Among patients without obstructive coronary artery disease, PAMP alone provided prognostic information in the multivariate survival analysis.

 To investigate the significance and mechanism of dilatation of the left ventricular cavity on dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging, we performed both dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging and dipyridamole radionuclide angiography on 83 patients with known angiograms.
 The dipyridamole/delayed ratio of the left ventricular dimension from the thallium-201 image was defined as the left ventricular dilatation ratio (LVDR).
 An LVDR greater than the mean + two standard deviations in patients without coronary artery disease was defined as abnormal.
 Twenty-two of 83 patients showed an abnormal LVDR, and 18 of the 22 patients (82%) had triple-vessel disease.
 By defect and washout analysis, the sensitivity and specificity for correctly identifying the patients as having triple-vessel disease was 72% and 76%, respectively, whereas LVDR had a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 93%.
 When LVDR was used in combination with the defect and washout criteria, sensitivity increased to 84% without a loss of specificity.
 In those 22 patients with abnormal LVDRs, end-diastolic volume measured by radionuclide angiography did not change after dipyridamole infusion.
 Dilatation of the left ventricular cavity on dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging reflected relative subendocardial hypoperfusion induced by dipyridamole rather than actual chamber enlargement.
 The LVDR was moderately sensitive and highly specific for triple-vessel disease and provided complementary information to dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging.

2245,"Reentrant ventricular arrhythmias in the late myocardial infarction period: mechanism by which a short-long-short cardiac sequence facilitates the induction of reentry.
 The electrophysiological mechanism by which a short-long-short stimulated cardiac sequence facilitates the induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmia was investigated in dogs 4 days after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery.
 In these dogs, reentry develops in the surviving electrophysiologically abnormal epicardial layer that overlies the infarct zone when premature stimulation results in a critically long arc of functional conduction block.
 The activation wavefront circulates around both ends of the arc, coalesces, and conducts slowly distal to the arc before reactivating sites proximal to the arc to initiate a figure-eight reentrant circuit.
 Epicardial isochronal activation maps and effective refractory periods (ERPs) were determined during three different stimulation protocols: A, a basic train of eight beats at a cycle length of 300 msec followed by a single premature stimulus (S2); B, a basic train of eight beats at a cycle length of 300 msec with abrupt lengthening of the last cycle of the train before S2 to 600 msec; C, a basic train of eight beats at a cycle length of 600 msec followed by S2.
 Protocol B was found to result in a differential lengthening of ERP at adjacent sites within the border of the epicardial ischemic zone, whereas protocols A and C induced, respectively, comparable shortening and lengthening of ERPs at the same sites.
 The differential lengthening of ERPs at adjacent sites resulted in an increased dispersion of refractoriness so that a premature stimulus induced functional conduction block between those sites.
 The development of a longer arc of conduction block and, hence, a longer reentrant pathway as well as slower conduction of the circulating wavefront during protocol B allowed more time for refractoriness to expire proximal to the arc and for the circulating wavefront to reexcite those sites to initiate reentry.
 The lengthening of ERP, associated with a single long cycle (protocol B), ranged from 44% to 79% of the total increase in ERP after a series of eight long cycles (protocol C).
 Epicardial sites with longer ERPs located close to the center of the ischemic zone showed more lengthening of refractoriness during protocol B compared with more normal sites near the border of the ischemic zone.
 This strongly suggests that the increased dispersion of refractoriness during protocol B is caused by the shorter memory of ischemic myocardium to the cumulative effects of preceding cycle lengths.

2246,"Therapeutic advantage of hypoxic cells in tumors: a theoretical study 
 The presence of hypoxic cells in solid tumors has long been considered a problem in cancer treatment, particularly for radiation therapy but also for treatment with some anticancer drugs.
 Three general strategies are being actively explored to overcome the problem: oxygenating the tumor, sensitizing the hypoxic cells to radiation (or chemotherapy), or killing the hypoxic cells (with a hypoxic cell cytotoxin).
 In the present study, we have examined the impact of each of these three strategies on a standard radiation therapy regimen (30 doses of 2 Gy), using either of two major assumptions: full reoxygenation or no reoxygenation of the tumor cells.
 We demonstrate that a hypoxic cell cytotoxin can produce a level of tumor cell killing higher (by several orders of magnitude) than that produced by full oxygenation of a tumor or by use of an optimum hypoxic cell radiosensitizer, provided the cytotoxin kills more than approximately 50% of the hypoxic cells each time it is given.
 The only assumption that makes a difference is whether reoxygenation occurs: In the worst case (ie, no reoxygenation), the hypoxic cell cytotoxin performs only as well as an optimum radiosensitizer.
 The analysis shows that hypoxic cells in tumors can be a major therapeutic advantage.
 Therefore, we recommend that research efforts be concentrated on development of superior hypoxic cell cytotoxins rather than improved hypoxic cell radiosensitizers and that, in parallel, emphasis be placed on development of agents to increase hypoxia.

2247,"Alcohol use and abuse in random samples of physicians and medical students.
 BACKGROUND.
 This study sought to resolve conflicting views about whether physicians are especially prone to alcohol abuse.
 METHODS.
 Using an anonymous, mailed questionnaire on substance use, we surveyed 500 physicians, 510 pharmacists, and 974 of their students.
 The physicians and pharmacists were selected randomly from the state society's membership lists, and students selected were from local school lists.
 Follow-up surveys were sent to nonresponders at two-week intervals.
 RESULTS.
 The physicians and medical students did not drink especially heavily and were no more vulnerable to alcoholism than were their counterparts in pharmacy and other professions.
 Physicians differed from pharmacists in their style of drinking (greater frequency, smaller quantity), but not in total amount of alcohol consumed.
 Drinking habits among physicians were not associated with medical specialty or type of practice, but were positively related to gender (males drank more than females) and to age (older doctors were more apt to qualify as heavy drinkers than were younger doctors).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Physicians were no more likely to abuse substances nonmedically than were other professionals.
 Any group in which alcohol use is nearly universal incurs a risk of abuse and impairment that cannot be ignored.

2248,"Correlates of survival and the Daumas-Duport grading system for astrocytomas.
 In order to examine the correlation between prognosis and the histological features of nuclear atypia, mitosis, endothelial proliferation, and necrosis in supratentorial adult astrocytomas, the authors reviewed 251 such cases treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1972 and 1980.
 One point was given for the presence of each feature.
 The total number of features was translated into a grade as follows: none of the four features = Grade 1 (one patient), one feature = Grade 2 (36 patients), two features = Grade 3 (33 patients), and three or four features = Grade 4 (181 patients).
 The period of survival was significantly associated with grade, the presence or absence of each of the four histological features, patient's age, type of operation, radiation therapy, and extent of tumor (log rank, p less than 0.05).
 The variables associated with grade were age (p less than 0.001) and radiation therapy (p less than 0.02).
 After adjustment for these variables using a Cox proportional-hazards model, the difference in overall survival time between patients in Grades 2 and 3 was not statistically significant.
 When comparable groups of patients were examined in terms of age or receipt of radiation therapy, the median survival times differed markedly.
 Patients 50 years of age or less had a median survival time of 68 months (Grade 2 tumors), 29 months (Grade 3 tumors), and 13 months (Grade 4 tumors).
 Patients over 50 years of age had a median survival time of 6 months (Grade 2 and 4 tumors) and 9 months (Grade 3 tumors).
 Those patients who had received radiation therapy had a median survival time of 68 months (Grade 2 tumors), 21 months (Grade 3 tumors), and 11 months (Grade 4 tumors).
 Those patients who did not receive radiation therapy had a median survival time of 1 month (Grade 2 tumors) and 2 months (Grade 3 and 4 tumors); over half of these patients died within 2 months of surgery.
 This grading system, originally proposed by Daumas-Duport, et al., is simple, objective, and reproducible, and correlates well with survival times.
 The authors recommend that astrocytomas be graded on a scale of 1 to 4, with Grade 1 reserved for the rare adult supratentorial astrocytoma with none of the four histological features.

2249,"The tangled web of coronary risk factors.
 Although epidemiologic, genetic, and pathophysiologic studies have shown that low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are involved in the development of coronary artery disease, the standard measurement of LDL cholesterol comprises a number of separate components that may contribute in different ways to the disease process.
 Some of these components appear to be of particular pathologic importance.
 Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs) and lipoprotein (a) are highly atherogenic species that each normally account for up to 10% to 15% total LDL cholesterol but may be disproportionately elevated in pathologic states and may therefore contribute disproportionately to coronary disease risk in certain patients.
 Recently, another subclass of LDL, characterized by relatively small particle size and increased density, also has been found to be associated with relatively increased risk of coronary disease.
 Furthermore, levels of this subclass, designated LDL-III, are linked to a number of interrelated hormonal and metabolic factors, each of which have also been associated with risk of coronary artery disease.
 These include male gender, postmenopause, abdominal adiposity, elevated triglyceride levels, increased levels of apolipoprotein B, and reductions in high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), particularly in the HDL2 subclass.
 Other studies have demonstrated that many of these factors are also commonly associated with relative insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.
 Thus, a lipoprotein profile characterized by a relative increase in LDL-III and a reduction in HDL2 is indicative of a constellation of metabolic features that defines a high-risk state and that makes it extremely difficult to single out one or more factors that are most directly involved in the disease process.
 Combinations of genetic and environmental factors acting on this ""tangled web"" of risk factors may account for much of the variation in coronary disease susceptibility found in the general population.

2250,"Feasibility of reversing benzodiazepine tolerance with flumazenil 
 To examine whether the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can reverse tolerance to benzodiazepines but without precipitating withdrawal seizures, the antiepileptic effect of flumazenil itself and its ability to reverse tolerance at a dose that would leave sufficient receptors free for the binding of benzodiazepines were investigated.
 Electroencephalographic studies in 6 patients with partial and 6 with generalised seizures showed that flumazenil had a short (20 min) non-dose-dependent suppressant effect on epileptic discharges in those with partial seizures.
 Receptor occupancy studies in 12 patients showed that 1.5 mg flumazenil given intravenously occupied 55% receptors, whereas 15 mg occupied nearly all receptors.
 When 3 patients with partial seizures who had become tolerant to clonazepam were given 1.5 mg flumazenil, they were seizure-free for 6-21 days after the injection.
 The value of intermittent therapy with a benzodiazepine antagonist for preventing or reversing tolerance to benzodiazepine agonists ought to be investigated further.

 Inconsistent data exist regarding the anatomy of the spinal nerve roots lateral to the thecal sac.
 A newly developed in situ technique was used to precisely define anatomic parameters on 20 fresh human cadavers.
 The take-off angle of the nerve roots from the thecal sac decreases from a mean of approximately 40 degrees from L1-L5 to 22 degrees at S1.
 The motor bundles are directly ventral to the sensory fibers within individual roots extrathecally.
 Dorsal root ganglia size varies with vertebral level.
 The majority of ganglia lie directly beneath the vertebral pedicles and one third overlie a portion of the lateral intervertebral disc.
 These previously undescribed relationships may aid in the understanding of lumbosacral neurocompressive disorders and are important to note during pedicle screw insertion, posterolateral decompression for spinal trauma, and paravertebral approaches for lateral disc herniations.

2252,"Implications of peritoneal cytology for staging of early pancreatic cancer.
 Cytologic examination of peritoneal washings was performed in 40 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (35 head, 5 body) whose tumors had been selected as potentially resectable by computed tomographic (CT) findings.
 Saline (100 mL) was instilled and aspirated at laparoscopy in 27 patients and at laparotomy in 13.
 Malignant cells were found in the peritoneal washings in 12 of 40 patients (30%): 29% in cancers of the pancreatic head versus 40% in the body; 33% at laparoscopy versus 23% at laparotomy; and in 4 of 8 patients with ascites versus 8 of 32 without ascites.
 The cytology was positive in 6 of 8 patients (75%) who had a prior percutaneous needle biopsy versus 6 of 32 (19%) of those who did not (p less than 0.01).
 Liver metastases were found in six patients, all with negative cytology.
 One of 10 pancreatic head cancers with positive cytology was resectable versus 13 of 25 with negative cytology (p less than 0.05).
 Survival was significantly longer in patients with negative cytology.
 We conclude that (1) pancreatic cancer sheds malignant cells into the peritoneum early and commonly; (2) laparoscopic lavage is an effective means of cytologic study; (3) ascites is not a precondition for cytologic study, nor does its presence necessarily imply carcinomatosis; (4) intraperitoneal spread of cancer cells may be promoted by tumor biopsy; (5) cytologic findings provide an additional index of resectability; and (6) cytologic findings appear to correlate with duration of survival.
 This study shows that even ""localized"" pancreatic cancer is often not contained and suggests caution with biopsy of potentially curable lesions.

2253,"Achievement of life goals by adult survivors of modern treatment for childhood cancer.
 To assess the impact of the diagnosis and modern treatment of childhood cancer on achievement of adult goals, the authors evaluated employment, health and life insurance coverage, marriage, divorce, and reproduction in 227 former pediatric cancer patients.
 Each area was evaluated in relation to a common set of disease and demographic factors that included age at follow-up, age at diagnosis, gender, marital status, history of disease recurrence, and diagnosis.
 Patients were younger than 20 years of age at diagnosis, and their diagnoses were made between January 1, 1960, and December 31, 1984.
 The median age at diagnosis was 11.4 years, and the median age at follow-up was 26.6 years.
 The percentage of unemployed male respondents did not differ from population norms.
 The percentage of unemployed female respondents, however, was slightly higher than that of the United States population.
 Approximately 11% of the survivors reported some form of employment-related discrimination, a level significantly lower than that of prior reports.
 Company-offered health insurance was provided to 92.4% of full-time and 90.0% of part-time employed respondents.
 Life insurance was purchased by 60% of full-time employed men and 55% of women.
 These percentages were lower than those reported for the United States population.
 Twenty-four percent of those with life insurance had difficulty obtaining it.
 Fifty-eight percent of the subjects were married or lived as married.
 The percentages of married men and women were significantly lower than United States norms.
 Twenty percent of those who were married or lived as married have divorced or separated or no longer live as married.
 Women aged 20 to 24 years were less likely to marry, and women aged 35 to 44 years had a significantly higher frequency of divorce than similarly aged United States women.
 In general, the history of childhood cancer did not influence the decision to marry or live as married but was occasionally (20%) important in the decision to dissolve a marital relationship.
 Many former patients indicated that their diagnosis and treatment for childhood cancer influenced their decision to have children.
 The current study suggests that most former pediatric cancer patients achieve adult life goals.
 Additional research is necessary to define those populations at greatest risk of failure to achieve these goals.

2254,"Effect of nisoldipine on hemodynamic responses to defibrillation.
 Sequences of ventricular fibrillation-defibrillation cause transient hypertension; we hypothesized that this ""adrenergic overshoot"" might be blunted by the functional antiadrenergic effect of the calcium channel blocking drug nisoldipine, with a potentially beneficial reduction in myocardial oxygen requirements.
 However, other calcium channel blocking drugs have been shown to reduce shock success for defibrillation, a deleterious effect.
 Thus the purposes of this study were to assess the effect of nisoldipine on the hemodynamic responses to the sequences of ventricular fibrillation-defibrillation, and its effect on the energy requirements for defibrillation.
 In 16 dogs we administered intravenous nisoldipine (1 microgram/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 0.075 to 0.50 microgram/kg/min) to lower mean blood pressure 10% and 20% below baseline.
 Ventricular fibrillation was induced electrically, and shocks of varying energy levels (30, 50, and 100 joules) were administered to determine defibrillation energy requirements.
 Heart rates and blood pressures were recorded up to 3 minutes after each shock to determine hemodynamic responses.
 Measurements were made before nisoldipine administration and again at the two levels of drug-induced blood pressure decline.
 We found that the usual systolic blood pressure ""overshoot"" after defibrillation (typically maximum at 15 to 30 seconds after shocks) was significantly blunted after nisoldipine administration (p less than 0.05).
 Heart rate slowing after defibrillation (a cholinergic response) was not affected.
 Nisoldipine did not alter shock success rates, which varied from 12 +/- 7%SE at 30 joules to 68 +/- 12% at 100 joules.
 Thus nisoldipine blunted the ""adrenergic overshoot"" of systolic blood pressure following defibrillation, a potentially beneficial effect, without altering the energy requirements for transthoracic defibrillation.

 This technique has significant advantages over conventional film autoradiography for investigating the distribution of radiolabeled compounds: shorter acquisition times due to the high sensitivity, easier sample handling, direct quantification and the ability to perform dynamic studies.
 The detector performance shows a spatial resolution of 0.9 mm for carbon-14 (14C) (0.156 MeV), good linearity and homogeneity.
 The noise level is below 50/(cm2.sec).
 Successful imaging with this system has been performed with beta-emitters 14C, sulfur-35 (35S), iodine-131 (131I), yttrium-90 (90Y), and positron emitters gallium-68 (68Ga), and fluorine-18 (18F).

2259,"Evidence for intraluminal Ca++ regulatory site defect in sarcoplasmic reticulum from malignant hyperthermia pig muscle.
 Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disease of humans and various animal species that predisposes to a life-threatening, anesthetic agent-induced syndrome.
 MH is thought to be a consequence of abnormal, sustained increases in myoplasmic Ca++ and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes from MH muscle have been shown to have a Ca++ release channel defect.
 In the present study we have tested a hypothesis that the abnormal Ca++ release mechanism in MH can be expressed when Ca++ is loaded in the presence of pyrophosphate.
 SR membrane vesicles isolated from normal and MH pig muscle were loaded with Ca++ in the presence and absence of pyrophosphate until Ca(++)-induced Ca++ release occurred.
 Under both circumstances the threshold amount of Ca++ loaded until Ca++ release occurred was lower in the SR from MH pig skeletal muscle.
 This difference in amount of Ca++ preload is not explained by results obtained comparing rates of Ca++ uptake, number of ryanodine binding sites or the amounts of calsequestrin among SR vesicles from MH and normal muscle.
 We conclude from this study that use of pyrophosphate for Ca++ loading does not ablate the abnormal Ca++ release in SR from MH muscle, suggesting the study can be done on small amounts of SR from biopsied human muscle.
 The data also suggest that abnormality in an intraluminal, low affinity Ca++ binding site regulating Ca++ release occurs in the SR membrane of MH pig muscle.

 In all brains, the planum temporale was again symmetrical.
 Also, in two of the brains, multiple foci of cerebrocortical glial scarring were present.
 In both women, many of the scars were myelinated, suggesting origination during late intrauterine or early postnatal life.
 In one, scars were mainly left perisylvian and involved portions of the vascular border zone of the temporal cortex.
 In the other, scars were more numerous and occurred in the border zone of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries symmetrically.
 All three cases showed to a variable extent brain warts, molecular layer ectopias, and focal architectonic dysplasia identical to those seen in the male cases.
 Two women had primary brain neoplasms, an oligodendroglioma and a low-grade astrocytoma, respectively, and two women showed small angiomas.
